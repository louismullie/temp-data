## Question

A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents for routine follow-up. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) one year ago. He reports no current foot pain or ulcers. On examination, his feet appear intact, but he has diminished pedal pulses bilaterally. He lives with his daughter, who helps him with daily activities. The clinic nurse asks you how to approach his foot care during this visit and in the future.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what steps should you take regarding this patient's foot care during today's visit and for his ongoing management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach foot care for a 68-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and established peripheral artery disease, including what to do today and how to structure ongoing management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification and what to do at today's visit. Then, I should verify the components of a comprehensive foot evaluation and how often to repeat it. Next, I will consider education and self-care, including footwear and when to escalate to therapeutic shoes. After that, I need to check specialist referral thresholds and team-based care. Finally, I will integrate cardiovascular risk reduction and set a follow-up cadence, making sure each element aligns with current ACC/AHA and ADA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. At 68 years old with diabetes and PAD, he is at high risk for foot ulcers and amputation, and diminished pedal pulses indicate impaired perfusion even if he is asymptomatic, so I should not be reassured by the absence of pain or ulcers. I need to ensure we move beyond routine screening to preventive surveillance and education now, not later [^111fbJUW] [^115beQqe].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate actions for today's visit. I should perform a focused foot inspection for skin integrity, calluses, deformities, and nail pathology, and I should palpate pulses and assess capillary refill. Given his PAD, a comprehensive foot evaluation is indicated at least annually, so if one has not been done in the past year, I should complete it today or schedule it soon, documenting neuropathy testing and footwear assessment as part of that evaluation [^111rEe5x] [^111Ujy1H] [^114w4d9Z].

> Hold on, I should verify the education components I must deliver today. I need to teach daily self-inspection of the entire foot, including soles and between toes, with a mirror if needed, and reinforce prompt reporting of any change in color, temperature, swelling, pain, or breaks in skin. I should also instruct on gentle cleansing, thorough drying, and application of moisturizer to avoid fissures, and I must emphasize never going barefoot and using well-fitting shoes and socks. I should involve his daughter in this teaching because caregiver support improves adherence and early detection [^111rEe5x] [^115VesGR] [^116npziu].

> I need to check footwear next. Standard shoes should be comfortable, protective, and appropriately sized. But wait, what if he has deformities, calluses, or loss of protective sensation? In that case, I should arrange therapeutic footwear prescribed by a specialist, as this reduces plantar pressure and ulcer risk in high-risk patients with diabetes and PAD, and I should document the rationale for coverage if needed [^111rEe5x] [^113TLfsy] [^112LFHuz].

> Next, I should review specialist referral. Given PAD plus diabetes, referral to a foot care specialist is reasonable even if asymptomatic, and it is strongly recommended for those with prior ulcers, amputation, deformity, or loss of protective sensation. I should confirm that he is connected to podiatry for longitudinal surveillance and preventive care, and I will coordinate with his PCP and vascular colleagues for team-based management [^111rEe5x] [^111vqfb6] [^113S6vYW].

> Let me consider the follow-up cadence. I should confirm that foot inspection occurs at every visit, while a comprehensive foot evaluation should be repeated at least annually. For patients at higher risk, such as those with PAD, more frequent assessments are prudent, and IWGDF suggests every 3–6 months for moderate risk and every 1–3 months for high risk; I should individualize based on neuropathy, deformity, and prior ulcer history, and I will document the risk category and schedule accordingly [^111rEe5x] [^115beQqe] [^11252TU8].

> I should double-check that cardiovascular risk reduction is integrated, because foot outcomes improve with systemic risk control. This includes high-intensity statin, antihypertensive therapy to guideline targets, smoking cessation support, and antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated. In diabetes with PAD, GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit are reasonable when eGFR allows, and I will align these with his primary care and endocrinology teams [^115xxesy] [^113fHt24] [^112PvWDW].

> But wait, what if I initially thought to obtain a new ABI today? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. He already has an established PAD diagnosis, so repeating ABI is not mandatory at this visit unless there has been a change in symptoms or perfusion. I should reserve ABI for new symptoms, interval worsening, or if I need to quantify disease progression, and otherwise focus on surveillance and prevention today [^1128rnu6].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure nothing is missing. Today I will inspect the feet, assess pulses and perfusion, deliver structured education with caregiver involvement, evaluate footwear and arrange therapeutic shoes if indicated, and initiate referral to podiatry for ongoing preventive care. Going forward, I will perform foot inspection at every visit, repeat a comprehensive foot evaluation at least annually, and escalate surveillance frequency with rising risk, all while reinforcing systemic risk reduction and team-based coordination to reduce ulcer and amputation risk [^111rEe5x] [^111vqfb6] [^113S6vYW].

For a 68-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and PAD, **foot inspection at every visit** [^111rEe5x] and a **comprehensive foot evaluation annually** [^116gTML8] are essential. Provide **daily self-care education** [^115VesGR] and refer to a foot care specialist for ongoing preventive care and surveillance [^115K4Quk] [^111vqfb6]. Emphasize **smoking cessation**, glycemic control, and blood pressure management [^115xxesy] [^113fHt24] [^113FLLgA]. If high risk, prescribe therapeutic footwear [^113TLfsy] and consider home foot temperature monitoring [^11252TU8]. These steps reduce ulcer and amputation risk and align with current ACC/AHA and ADA guidelines [^111rEe5x] [^111vqfb6].

## Immediate foot care steps during today's visit

### Clinical foot examination

- **Visual inspection**: Examine both feet for skin integrity, calluses, blisters, cracks, fissures, nail abnormalities, and signs of infection (erythema, warmth, swelling, purulence) [^111Ujy1H].

- **Palpation of pulses**: Assess dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses; diminished pulses indicate ongoing ischemia and warrant heightened vigilance [^113jEMmo].

- **Neurological assessment**: Perform monofilament testing (10-g) [^111Ujy1H] to assess for loss of protective sensation (LOPS), and include at least one additional test (pinprick, temperature, vibration) [^11539ToZ].

- **Structural assessment**: Evaluate for foot deformities, Charcot arthropathy, and biomechanical abnormalities that increase ulcer risk [^111Ujy1H].

---

### Patient education and self-care instructions

- **Daily foot inspection**: Instruct the patient to inspect both feet daily for cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, or nail problems, using a mirror if necessary [^116npziu].

- **Foot hygiene**: Emphasize daily washing with mild soap, thorough drying (especially between toes), and application of moisturizer to prevent fissures [^111BhqdV].

- **Proper footwear**: Advise on well-fitting shoes with cushioned soles and seamless socks; avoid tight shoes, high heels, and barefoot walking [^116npziu].

- **Nail care**: Teach proper nail trimming techniques or arrange professional nail care to prevent ingrown nails and trauma [^116RCh24].

- **Prompt reporting**: Encourage immediate reporting of any foot injury, discoloration, or persistent pain [^116npziu].

---

### Risk stratification and referral

Risk stratification should follow the **IWGDF categories** [^115beQqe] (low, moderate, high) based on the presence of PAD, LOPS, deformity, or prior ulcer/amputation. Referral to a **podiatrist or foot care specialist** is recommended for ongoing preventive care and surveillance, especially for moderate-to-high risk patients [^115K4Quk] [^111vqfb6].

---

## Ongoing foot care management plan

### Regular follow-up and surveillance

- **Frequency of foot examinations**: Schedule foot inspections at every visit [^111rEe5x]; perform a comprehensive foot evaluation at least annually [^116gTML8].

- **Risk-based surveillance**: For low risk, annual screening; moderate risk, every 3–6 months; high risk, every 1–3 months [^115beQqe] [^11252TU8].

- **Longitudinal care**: Monitor limb symptoms, functional status, and risk factor management at each visit [^112cU85W].

---

### Multidisciplinary care and patient-centered approach

Multidisciplinary care should coordinate **podiatry, vascular surgery, endocrinology, and primary care** to optimize outcomes [^113S6vYW]. Patient-centered care engages the patient and family in shared decision-making and self-care adherence [^116xLQ8i].

---

### Preventive interventions

- **Therapeutic footwear**: Prescribe for high-risk patients to reduce plantar pressure and prevent ulcers [^113TLfsy] [^112LFHuz].

- **Home foot temperature monitoring**: Consider for high-risk patients to detect early inflammation and prevent ulcers [^11252TU8].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommend and provide resources for quitting [^115xxesy].

---

### Management of comorbidities

Management of comorbidities should prioritize **glycemic control** to reduce microvascular complications and improve limb outcomes [^113fHt24] [^112rhivc]. Blood pressure management should follow a stepwise antihypertensive approach to reduce cardiovascular risk [^113FLLgA]. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel is indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction [^113yiks4].

---

## Patient education and empowerment

Patient education and empowerment should provide **written materials** on foot care, risk factors, and warning signs. Teach-back techniques should be used to confirm understanding and adherence. Connect the patient with support groups, diabetes educators, and community resources to reinforce self-care [^115vzx7K].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) foot care — risk-based surveillance and evaluation is emphasized, stating that ongoing foot surveillance and patient self-foot care education is important. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines propose risk-based screening frequencies: low risk annual foot screening, moderate risk assess feet every 3 to 6 months, and high risk assess feet every 1 to 3 months. A comprehensive foot evaluation is recommended at least annually for patients with PAD, and this recommendation is based on expert opinion. The presence of foot deformities is a risk factor, and therapeutic footwear recommended by a specialist that fits properly, reduces plantar pressure, and can help prevent a foot ulcer in patients with diabetes who are at risk is described. Home foot temperature monitoring has emerged as another potential tool to reduce the incidence of foot ulcers in high-risk patients, although additional studies are needed. A 2015 Cochrane database review of 6 studies reported insufficient evidence that education-oriented interventions improved outcomes in terms of foot ulcers and lower extremity amputations. Self-foot care measures, including nail/skin care, daily washing and drying, exercises, and protective footwear, can be beneficial in preventing foot ulcers.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) without diabetes mellitus — patient education: It is reasonable to counsel patients with PAD without diabetes mellitus about self-foot examination and healthy foot behaviors. Although there are no data that have evaluated this practice in a population of patients with PAD but without diabetes mellitus, this is a very low-risk intervention with potential for benefit, and educational efforts generally include teaching patients about healthy foot behaviors (e.g., daily inspection of feet, foot care and hygiene, including appropriate toenail cutting strategies; avoidance of barefoot walking), the selection of appropriately fitting shoes, and the importance of seeking medical attention for new foot problems.

### Guidelines on diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease in patients with foot ulcers and diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^114mrzDp]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients with foot ulcers and diabetes and updates the previous IWGDF Guideline. Up to 50% of patients with diabetes and foot ulceration have concurrent PAD, which confers a significantly elevated risk of adverse limb events and cardiovascular disease. We know that the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of these patients are markedly different to patients with diabetes who do not have PAD and yet there are few good quality studies addressing this important subset of patients. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the patient-intervention-comparison-outcome (PICO) format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to the intervention. We here present the updated 2019 guidelines on diagnosis, prognosis, and management of PAD in patients with a foot ulcer and diabetes, and we suggest some key future topics of particular research interest.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) multidisciplinary foot care — care team involvement notes that a multispecialty care team approach promotes collaboration, avoids duplication of care across risk factor management, foot care, and revascularization, and allows for coordinated management to improve outcomes. For preventive foot care, the patient and their family or caregivers are important members of the care team. Engagement of foot care specialists for longitudinal follow-up is recommended by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines for patients at moderate or high risk of foot ulcers and is reasonable for all patients with PAD when available. Observational Medicare claims data indicated reduced lower extremity amputation rates among patients with diabetes receiving care from a multispecialty team that included a foot specialist.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PAD is defined by atherosclerotic obstruction of the arteries to the legs that reduce arterial flow during exercise or at rest, and is associated with systemic atherosclerosis. The clinical presentation of PAD is quite varied, including patients with atypical leg symptoms, classic intermittent claudication, and critical limb ischemia. Clinical assessment of these patients includes a comprehensive history, physical examination, and noninvasive and invasive vascular studies. The major risk factors for PAD include diabetes mellitus, tobacco abuse, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and advanced age. Because of the presence of these risk factors, the systemic nature of atherosclerosis, and the high risk of ischemic events, patients with PAD should be candidates for comprehensive secondary prevention strategies, including aggressive glycemic control, all attempts at tobacco cessation, lipid lowering and antihypertensive treatment, antiplatelet therapy, and thorough foot care. This article reviews the comprehensive diagnostic algorithm and medical treatment strategies for patients with infrainguinal PAD.

Key points
- People with diabetes are at risk of diabetes-related foot conditions.
- Conditions include neuropathy, arthropathy, and vasculopathy.
- Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly comprehensive foot exams and treatment. Podiatrists in diabetes care Podiatrists play a key role in detecting and treating foot problems in people with diabetes. These include neuropathy, arthropathy, and vasculopathy. Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly comprehensive foot exams and treatment. Key messages to share with your patients Encourage your patients to do the following:

- Ask for a basic foot check at every health care visit.
- Get yearly comprehensive foot exams.
- Get their feet checked more often if they have difficulty managing their blood sugar or blood pressure.
- Learn more about diabetes and your feet and tips for healthy feet.

Let patients know:

- Regular foot checks combined with yearly comprehensive exams can help identify problems early.
- Annual foot exams assess pulses, sensation, foot structure and function, and nails.
- They should contact their doctor if they notice a foot problem rather than treat it themselves.
- Diabetes-related complications can start in their feet and may not cause recognizable symptoms. Take these 5 actions to help your patients 1. Know the risks of foot disorders and amputation for diabetes patients. People with diabetes are at risk of diabetes-related foot conditions. However, many do not get regular preventive care. Nearly half of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy may not have symptoms. Without preventive foot care, this condition can lead to foot injury in areas where patients lack feeling. Statistics
- People with both diabetes and peripheral vascular disease have a higher risk of amputation.
- Low-income, rural, African American, and American Indian people with diabetes have a higher risk of amputation.
- About 12% of people with diabetes develop diabetic foot ulcers during their lifetime.
- In 2016, there were 4. 9 lower-extremity amputations per 1, 000 adults diagnosed with diabetes.
- In 2016, about 130, 000 diabetes-related hospital discharges involved a lower-extremity amputation.
- 19% to 53% of diabetes patients with a lower-extremity amputation will have another amputation of the opposite extremity within 5 years. Keep Reading: Preventing diabetes-related amputations.
2. Encourage your patients to watch for foot problems. At each health care visit, tell your patients with diabetes about the signs of foot problems. This will help them be aware of changes in their feet when they start. You can make sure your patients understand the information by asking them to repeat what they heard. Common signs of foot health issues 3.

Ask your patients about their foot health at each visit. For example:

- Do you check your own feet every day.
- Do you know how to check your feet.
- Do you have appropriate footwear to prevent ulcers.
- Do you visit a podiatrist for a comprehensive foot exam at least once a year.
- Do you contact a health care provider when you notice a foot problem. You can refer your patients to a podiatrist or provide them with more information about recommended foot care for people with diabetes.
4. Help your patients see the connection between diabetes management and healthy feet. Use the following pointers to support healthy diabetes management for your patients:

- Promote the ABCs of diabetes and a healthy lifestyle.
- Connect patients to health coaches, patient navigators, nutritionists, community health workers, and local community resources, when possible.
- Encourage patients to get regular foot health checkups.

### Current status and principles for the treatment and prevention of diabetic foot ulcers in the cardiovascular patient population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115ZQTZG]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the known higher risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes, the pathophysiology and optimal management of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a leading complication associated with diabetes, is complex and continues to evolve. Complications of type 2 diabetes, such as DFUs, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and the leading cause of major lower extremity amputation in the United States. There has recently been a strong focus on the prevention and early treatment of DFUs, leading to the development of multidisciplinary diabetic wound and amputation prevention clinics across the country. Mounting evidence has shown that, despite these efforts, amputations associated with DFUs continue to increase. Furthermore, due to increasing patient complexity of management secondary to comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, the management of peripheral artery disease associated with DFUs has become increasingly difficult, and care delivery is often episodic and fragmented. Although structured, process-specific approaches exist at individual institutions for the management of DFUs in the cardiovascular patient population, there is insufficient awareness of these principles in the general medicine communities. Furthermore, there is growing interest in better understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of DFUs to better define personalized medicine to improve outcomes. The goals of this scientific statement are to provide salient background information on the complex pathogenesis and current management of DFUs in cardiovascular patients, to guide therapeutic and preventive strategies and future research directions, and to inform public policy makers on health disparities and other barriers to improving and advancing care in this expanding patient population.

Abbreviations ABI, ankle-brachial index; CTA, computed tomography angiography; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; TBI, toe-brachial index. *Recommended annual clinical evaluation (medical history, feet inspection, assessing PAD symptoms, monofilament test)

To aid in the early detection of PAD in individuals with T2DM, the American Diabetes Association recommends screening for asymptomatic PAD using the ABI in patients with T2DM at high risk for PAD, including any of the following: age ≥ 50 years, diabetes duration ≥ 10 years, comorbid microvascular disease, clinical evidence of foot complications, or any end-organ damage from diabetes. However, the usefulness of screening PAD using the ABI and the TBI among patients with T2DM without any symptoms or wound problems remains a topic of debate. There are no randomized trials comparing PAD screening versus no screening in patients with T2DM. Moreover, the United States Preventive Services Task Force suggested that in patients with T2DM who are already at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), screening for PAD with an ABI is unlikely to alter effective management decisions and improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, screening for PAD using the ABI is justifiable in patients with T2DM, given that PAD is a public health issue that is often underrecognized, and not performing this non-invasive and readily available diagnostic test is potentially harmful in individuals at high risk for PAD.

Does T2DM make a difference in the therapeutic approach of PAD?

Key points
- People with diabetes are at risk of diabetes-related foot conditions.
- Conditions include neuropathy, arthropathy, and vasculopathy.
- Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly comprehensive foot exams and treatment. Podiatrists in diabetes care Podiatrists play a key role in detecting and treating foot problems in people with diabetes. These include neuropathy, arthropathy, and vasculopathy. Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly comprehensive foot exams and treatment. Key messages to share with your patients Encourage your patients to do the following:

- Ask for a basic foot check at every health care visit.
- Get yearly comprehensive foot exams.
- Get their feet checked more often if they have difficulty managing their blood sugar or blood pressure.
- Learn more about diabetes and your feet and tips for healthy feet.

Let patients know:

- Regular foot checks combined with yearly comprehensive exams can help identify problems early.
- Annual foot exams assess pulses, sensation, foot structure and function, and nails.
- They should contact their doctor if they notice a foot problem rather than treat it themselves.
- Diabetes-related complications can start in their feet and may not cause recognizable symptoms. Take these 5 actions to help your patients 1. Know the risks of foot disorders and amputation for diabetes patients. People with diabetes are at risk of diabetes-related foot conditions. However, many do not get regular preventive care. Nearly half of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy may not have symptoms. Without preventive foot care, this condition can lead to foot injury in areas where patients lack feeling. Statistics
- People with both diabetes and peripheral vascular disease have a higher risk of amputation.
- Low-income, rural, African American, and American Indian people with diabetes have a higher risk of amputation.
- About 12% of people with diabetes develop diabetic foot ulcers during their lifetime.
- In 2016, there were 4. 9 lower-extremity amputations per 1, 000 adults diagnosed with diabetes.
- In 2016, about 130, 000 diabetes-related hospital discharges involved a lower-extremity amputation.
- 19% to 53% of diabetes patients with a lower-extremity amputation will have another amputation of the opposite extremity within 5 years. Keep Reading: Preventing diabetes-related amputations.
2. Encourage your patients to watch for foot problems. At each health care visit, tell your patients with diabetes about the signs of foot problems. This will help them be aware of changes in their feet when they start. You can make sure your patients understand the information by asking them to repeat what they heard. Common signs of foot health issues 3.

Ask your patients about their foot health at each visit. For example:

- Do you check your own feet every day.
- Do you know how to check your feet.
- Do you have appropriate footwear to prevent ulcers.
- Do you visit a podiatrist for a comprehensive foot exam at least once a year.
- Do you contact a health care provider when you notice a foot problem. You can refer your patients to a podiatrist or provide them with more information about recommended foot care for people with diabetes.
4. Help your patients see the connection between diabetes management and healthy feet. Use the following pointers to support healthy diabetes management for your patients:

- Promote the ABCs of diabetes and a healthy lifestyle.
- Connect patients to health coaches, patient navigators, nutritionists, community health workers, and local community resources, when possible.
- Encourage patients to get regular foot health checkups.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^117NFsC3]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Minimizing tissue loss in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) — education, infection recognition, and care recommendations are as follows: Prevention of wounds through patient education, foot examination, and prompt recognition of foot infection is important to minimize tissue loss among patients with PAD, and educational efforts are especially important for patients with PAD who have diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy. Because of the consequences associated with untreated foot infection — especially in the presence of PAD — clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion; foot infection is suspected with local findings or systemic inflammatory signs, including temperature ≥ 38°C or ≤ 36°C, heart rate > 90/min, respiratory rate ≥ 20/min or Paco2 < 32 mm Hg, and white blood cell count ≥ 12,000 or < 4,000/mcL or > 10% immature forms. Recommendations: Patients with PAD and diabetes mellitus should be counseled about self–foot examination and healthy foot behaviors; in patients with PAD, prompt diagnosis and treatment of foot infection are recommended to avoid amputation; in patients with PAD and signs of foot infection, prompt referral to an interdisciplinary care team can be beneficial; it is reasonable to counsel patients with PAD without diabetes mellitus about self–foot examination and healthy foot behaviors; and biannual foot examination by a clinician is reasonable for patients with PAD and diabetes mellitus.

### 2024 ACC / AHA / AACVPR / APMA / ABC / SCAI / SVM / SVN / SVS / SIR / VESS guideline for the management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114t28v4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) preventive foot care — risk‑stratified inspection schedules, comprehensive evaluation, and team-based management are specified with explicit intervals and recommendation strength: The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines propose foot inspection frequency by ulcer risk as low risk annual foot screening, moderate risk assess feet every 3 to 6 months, and high risk assess feet every 1 to 3 months. A comprehensive foot evaluation, which is a more in-depth assessment than routine inspection, is recommended at least annually for patients with PAD, and this recommendation is based on expert opinion. Therapeutic footwear recommended by a specialist that fits properly, reduces plantar pressure, and can help prevent a foot ulcer in patients with diabetes who are at risk is described, and home foot temperature monitoring has emerged as another potential tool to reduce the incidence of foot ulcers in high-risk patients, although additional studies are needed. Evidence for complex education-oriented preventive interventions is limited, with a 2015 Cochrane review of 6 studies reporting insufficient evidence that the education-oriented interventions improved outcomes in terms of foot ulcers and lower extremity amputations. Because of the complexity of PAD, a multispecialty care team approach promotes collaboration, avoids duplication, and allows coordinated management to improve outcomes; for preventive foot care the patient and family or caregivers are important team members, and engagement of foot care specialists for longitudinal follow-up is recommended by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines for patients at moderate or high risk of foot ulcers and is reasonable for all patients with PAD when available. In Medicare claims data, patients with diabetes receiving care from a multispecialty care team that included a foot specialist had reduced rates of lower extremity amputation.

### Expert panel guidance and narrative review of treatment simplification of complex insulin regimens to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^113S5U7H]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Candidates for Treatment Simplification

The recommendations presented in this manuscript are supported by the personal clinical experiences of the expert panel members. Where it is possible to improve health outcomes or QoL, treatment simplification should be considered for all people with T2D. A broader range of individuals should be assessed for treatment simplification, rather than just the frail or older individuals. Those already receiving multiple medication regimens for comorbidities such as CVD and CKD should be considered, in an effort to reduce their polypharmacy. People experiencing psychosocial and emotional distress related to T2D, obesity and individuals with impaired or diminished cognitive function can also benefit from simplification. Those who consistently do not achieve their target HbA 1c targets should also have their treatment plans assessed for simplification, in order to ensure they are receiving the most appropriate and adequate treatment. A list of triggers for considering simplification are presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Triggers for considering simplification. CHD coronary heart disease, CKD chronic kidney disease, GLP-1 RA glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, PAD peripheral arterial disease, PVD peripheral vascular disease, QoL quality of life, SGLT-2i sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor

Examples of individuals for whom treatment simplification may be appropriate and how this could be applied to their regimens are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. It is important to note that the potential treatment options for each example are not exclusive to those suggested in this publication. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Illustrative Profile 1

This 71-year-old man, with a 9-year history of T2D, also has arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. He was initially prescribed OADs, before being switched to basal insulin because of inadequate diabetes control and raised HbA 1c. Treatment was further intensified 3 years later to twice daily premixed insulin. He frequently experiences hypoglycaemic episodes and is struggling to manage his disease and the number of medications he is on. Simplification of his current treatment plan from premixed insulin to an FRC would reduce the number of daily injections and the likelihood of hypoglycaemia, thereby improving overall QoL.

### Prognostic importance of visit-to-visit blood pressure variability for micro-and macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: the rio de janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort study [^1179mTXh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants and baseline procedures

This prospective study included 682 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the Rio de Janeiro Type 2 Diabetes (RIO-T2D) Cohort Study, enrolled between August 2004 and December 2008 and followed-up until June 2019 in the diabetes outpatient clinic of our tertiary-care University Hospital. All participants gave written informed consent, and the local Ethics Committee had previously approved the study protocol. The characteristics of this cohort, the baseline procedures and the diagnostic definitions have been described previously. In summary, inclusion criteria were all adult type 2 diabetic individual up to 80 years old with either any microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy) or macrovascular (coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease) complication, or with at least two other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia or current smoking). Exclusion criteria were the presence of morbid obesity (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m²), advanced renal failure (serum creatinine > 180 μmol/l or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) or of any serious concomitant disease limiting life expectancy. Specifically for this analysis, 50 individuals who had any of the outcomes in the first 24-months of follow-up were excluded, totaling 632 individuals evaluated for BP-VVV parameters. All participants were submitted to a standard baseline protocol that included a thorough clinical-laboratory evaluation. Diagnostic criteria for diabetic chronic complications were detailed previously. In brief, coronary heart disease was diagnosed by clinical or electrocardiographic criteria, confirmed by positive ischemic stress tests. Cerebrovascular disease was diagnosed by history and physical examination, and peripheral arterial disease by an ankle-brachial index < 0.9. The diagnosis of nephropathy needed at least two albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/24 h or proteinuria ≥ 0.5 g/24 h or confirmed reduction of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², estimated by the CKD-EPI equation, or serum creatinine > 130 μmol/l). Peripheral neuropathy was determined by clinical examination (knee and ankle reflex activities, feet sensation with the Semmes–Weinstein monofilament, vibration with a 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick and temperature sensations) and neuropathic symptoms were assessed by a standard validated questionnaire. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured three times using a digital oscillometric BP monitor (HEM-907XL, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) with a suitable sized cuff on two occasions two weeks apart at study entry. The first measure of each visit was discarded and BP considered was the mean between the last two readings of each visit. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed if mean systolic (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg or if anti-hypertensive drugs had been prescribed. Laboratory evaluation included fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), serum creatinine and lipids. Albuminuria and proteinuria were evaluated in two non-consecutive sterile 24-h urine collections.

### Challenges and opportunities in the management of type 2 diabetes in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a tailored diagnosis and treatment review [^113yiks4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

As a secondary prophylaxis in patients with T2DM and symptomatic PAD, all clinical practice guidelines advocate single antiplatelet therapy, either aspirin (75–100 mg per day) or clopidogrel (75 mg per day), to reduce the risk of MACE. Of note, long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is not recommended in patients with T2DM and symptomatic PAD, as it may increase the risk of bleeding without providing substantial additional cardiovascular benefits. However, a combination of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and aspirin (100 mg once daily) should be considered in patients with symptomatic PAD at a low risk of bleeding. Compared with aspirin alone, the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin reduced the risk of MACE and MALE in patients with symptomatic PAD.

When intermittent claudication impairs everyday life activities, or if a patient with T2DM and symptomatic PAD develops CLTI, revascularization is recommended to restore direct blood flow to at least one of the foot arteries. Importantly, any revascularization procedure should be part of a comprehensive care plan that addresses other issues encountered in patients with T2DM and PAD including: prompt treatment of any concurrent foot infection, regular wound debridement, biomechanical offloading (if inappropriate plantar pressures are detected), control of blood glucose, assessment and improvement of nutritional status, treatment of edema and other comorbidities, as well as exercise rehabilitation.

### ACC / AHA versus ESC guidelines for diagnosis and management of peripheral Artery disease: JACC guideline comparison [^113EAL5p]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease is a common yet underdiagnosed cause of morbidity worldwide. Significant recent advances in management have resulted in new guideline creation for the diagnosis and management of peripheral artery disease in the United States and Europe. Here, we analyze each set of guidelines with special attention to those areas where the 2 groups disagree. Both groups emphasize the importance of risk factor reduction, including smoking cessation, lipid lowering, blood pressure management, and glucose control. The U.S. guidelines place additional attention on lifestyle factors, including regular physical activity and supervised exercise. The European guidelines offer a number of recommendations for revascularization in patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Both agree that more evidence is needed to understand which patients are at highest risk for tissue loss. A consistent charge to each committee fostering a similar approach to available data and more randomized studies would align recommendations across both organizations.

### Diabetic foot [^1118p1fY]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

How can it be prevented?

Regular foot examination

The suggested frequency for follow-up is based on expert consensus (see infographic). For people at low risk, continue annual foot assessments as they could progress to moderate or high risk. Emphasise the importance of foot care and monitoring glycaemic control.

More frequent follow-up is advised in patients at moderate or high risk, such as those with a foot deformity or with a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease at initial assessment. Repeat testing for neuropathy is not necessary if diagnosed previously. Neuropathy reversal is not established in studies. A quick inspection for a breach in skin integrity or ulceration should suffice. Patients with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease may be followed up in primary care and managed as in guidelines for peripheral arterial disease.

Refer patients with calluses and deformed toe nails to preventive podiatry services for basic nail and skin care, including debridement of calluses. Timely referral to foot protection services for control of risk factors in patients with diabetes prevents infection, gangrene, amputation, or death, and reduces hospital admissions and costs.

Glycaemic control

Early and good glycaemic control is effective in preventing neuropathy but there is a lack of studies to show that glycaemic control reverses neuropathy. Discuss optimal blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) targets with patients and monitor these as per standard guidelines for diabetes care to prevent or slow the progression of peripheral neuropathy.

Patient education

Offer people with diabetes or their caregivers, or both, oral and written information on:

The importance of blood glucose control and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as diet, exercise, body weight, and cessation of smoking.
The importance of foot care and advice on basic foot care (see box 3). While offering advice consider the patient's cultural practices and religious beliefs as well as social and family support.
The person's current risk of developing a foot problem.
When to seek professional help and who to contact in foot emergencies.

Evidence for the effectiveness of patient education on foot care is lacking. A Cochrane review of 11 randomised controlled trials concluded that brief foot care education alone does positively influence patient knowledge and behaviour in the short term, but it is ineffective in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. Education in a structured, organised, and repetitive manner, combined with preventive interventions may, however, prevent foot problems. Although the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot acknowledges the limited evidence on long term efficacy of patient education, it recommends some form of patient education to improve their foot care knowledge and behaviour.

### Is screening for heart failure and peripheral artery disease warranted in asymptomatic adults with diabetes? A perspective on the 2025 American diabetes association "Standards of care in diabetes" [^116rvn9f]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) publishes the "Standards of Care in Diabetes" (SOC) annually to offer clinicians, patients, and payers evidence-based guidelines for diabetes management. The 2025 SOC recommends that clinicians consider screening asymptomatic adults with diabetes for heart failure using natriuretic peptide levels, and that they screen asymptomatic adults with diabetes ≥ 65 years of age with any microvascular disease, foot complications, or end-organ damage from diabetes for peripheral artery disease (PAD) using ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing. This perspective evaluates those recommendations using established screening principles and the published literature. The recommendation to screen for heart failure using natriuretic peptide lacks robust evidence in several key areas. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, or NT-proBNP, itself performs poorly as a screening test in asymptomatic adults. Furthermore, there is ambiguity in treatment recommendations and insufficient evidence showing improved outcomes with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor treatment in adults with diabetes and stage B heart failure. Finally, the costs involved are high and may not be economically justifiable. Similarly, the recommendation to screen for PAD in asymptomatic adults with diabetes is not backed by rigorous scientific evidence. The evidence cited combines ABI screening with other effective screening tests and has limited generalizability. There is no guidance on how to interpret the results of ABI testing or how the information gained should be used to direct treatment. While the intent to improve health care through screening is commendable, these recommendations are inadequately supported by the principles of screening and the published literature. It is imperative that the ADA uses the greatest scientific rigor to prepare its SOC.

### Challenges and opportunities in the management of type 2 diabetes in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a tailored diagnosis and treatment review [^113RAzmF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) stands out as a potent risk factor for lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), with individuals with diabetes facing a two-fold higher risk of developing PAD compared to those without diabetes. In comparison to individuals without diabetes, those with T2DM exhibit a more severe manifestation, partly related to concomitant neuropathy, as well as a more distal distribution of PAD, increasing the risk of complications. Patients with concomitant T2DM and PAD are at a high risk of cardiovascular events, including lower-limb events. Moreover, patients with PAD and T2DM are 2–10× more likely than non-diabetic patients to undergo an amputation. Indeed, approximately 70% of cases undergoing lower-extremity amputation in the United States are attributed to diabetes. Diabetes-related amputations lead to profound functional disability, placing an immense economic burden on both patients and health systems. Globally, 113 million individuals aged 40 years and older are living with PAD, of whom about 20–30% present with concomitant T2DM.

Critical limb ischemia — Class I care processes and surveillance: Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) should undergo expedited evaluation and treatment of factors that are known to increase the risk of amputation. Patients with CLI in whom open surgical repair is anticipated should undergo assessment of cardiovascular risk. Patients with a prior history of CLI or who have undergone successful treatment for CLI should be evaluated at least twice annually by a vascular specialist owing to the relatively high incidence of recurrence. Patients at risk of CLI (ABI < 0.4 in an individual with diabetes, or any individual with diabetes and known lower extremity PAD) should undergo regular inspection of the feet to detect objective signs of CLI. The feet should be examined directly, with shoes and socks removed, at regular intervals after successful treatment of CLI. Patients with CLI and features to suggest atheroembolization should be evaluated for aneurysmal disease (e.g., abdominal aortic, popliteal, or common femoral aneurysms). Systemic antibiotics should be initiated promptly in patients with CLI, skin ulcerations, and evidence of limb infection. Patients with CLI and skin breakdown should be referred to healthcare providers with specialized expertise in wound care. Patients at risk for CLI (those with diabetes, neuropathy, chronic renal failure, or infection) who develop acute limb symptoms represent potential vascular emergencies and should be assessed immediately and treated by a specialist competent in treating vascular disease. Patients at risk for or who have been treated for CLI should receive verbal and written instructions regarding self-surveillance for potential recurrence.

### Comprehensive foot examination and risk assessment: a report of the task force of the foot care interest group of the American diabetes association, with endorsement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^111Dx31E]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It cannot be overstated that the complications of the diabetic foot are common, complex, and costly, mandating aggressive and proactive preventative assessments by generalists and specialists. All patients with diabetes must have their feet evaluated at least at yearly intervals for the presence of the predisposing factors for ulceration and amputation (neuropathy, vascular disease, and deformities). This report summarizes a simple protocol for doing so. If abnormalities are present, more frequent evaluation of the diabetic foot is recommended depending on risk category, as described above and in Table 4. It is through systematic examination and risk assessment, patient education, and timely referral that we may further reduce the unnecessarily high prevalence of lower-extremity morbidity in this population.

Preamble

Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care.

In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine, and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology. – The relationships among guidelines, data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere.

Intended Use

Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, revised, or superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles. –

Modernization

Processes have evolved to support the evolution of guidelines as "living documents" that can be dynamically updated. This process delineates a recommendation to address a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally < 250 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology.

Evidence Review

Writing committee members review the literature; weigh the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected health outcomes. In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. – Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited.

The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, and assess the evidence to address systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format (P = population, I = intervention, C = comparator, O = outcome, T = timing, S = setting).– Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself to systematic review and analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding recommendations.

Guideline-Directed Management and Treatment

The term "guideline-directed management and therapy" (GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.

Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence

The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1). – Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When > 1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically.

Relationships With Industry and Other Entities

The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All writing committee members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced writing committee and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online.

The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators.

Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated Conditions and Comorbidities

Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting. The guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances. The recommendations should not replace clinical judgment.

Clinical Implementation

Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^115SvJSc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Foot care — older adults with DM should have a careful foot examination at least annually to check skin integrity and to determine whether there is loss of sensation or decreased perfusion and more frequently if there is evidence of any of these findings (IIIA). Quality of evidence is Level II for more-frequent examinations for persons at high risk of foot problems and Level III for routine annual screening.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^11572goq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) with signs of foot infection — interdisciplinary care: In patients with PAD and signs of foot infection, prompt referral to an interdisciplinary care team can be beneficial. The EuroDIALE study demonstrated that the presence of both PAD and foot infection conferred a nearly 3-fold higher risk of leg amputation than either infection or PAD alone. The treatment of deep soft-tissue infection typically requires prompt surgical drainage; vascular imaging and expeditious revascularization generally follow, and experienced clinical teams have reported very good outcomes when this is performed in a coordinated and timely fashion.

### Challenges and opportunities in the management of type 2 diabetes in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a tailored diagnosis and treatment review [^114o5gUF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) often results from atherosclerosis, and is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Individuals with T2DM exhibit a more severe manifestation and a more distal distribution of PAD compared to those without diabetes, adding complexity to the therapeutic management of PAD in this particular patient population. Indeed, the management of PAD in patients with T2DM requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach that addresses both the systemic effects of diabetes and the specific vascular complications of PAD. Hence, cardiovascular prevention is of the utmost importance in patients with T2DM and PAD, and encompasses smoking cessation, a healthy diet, structured exercise, careful foot monitoring, and adherence to routine preventive treatments such as statins, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. It is also recommended to incorporate glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in the medical management of patients with T2DM and PAD, due to their demonstrated cardiovascular benefits. However, the specific impact of these novel glucose-lowering agents for individuals with PAD remains obscured within the background of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). In this review article, we distil evidence, through a comprehensive literature search of CVOTs and clinical guidelines, to offer key directions for the optimal medical management of individuals with T2DM and lower extremity PAD in the era of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i.

### Peripheral arterial disease… [^116BtGoP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explore the latest in peripheral arterial disease, including diagnosis, prevention, and management of the disease and its risk factors. This JAMA Clinical Guidelines Synopsis summarizes the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association's 2024 guidelines on management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease. This cohort study examines the differences in the treatment of peripheral artery disease between Black and White patients over time and by state. This cohort study develops a novel integrated, multiancestry polygenic risk score for peripheral artery disease and evaluates its risk estimation for PAD and major adverse limb events in populations from 3 biobanks. This Viewpoint discusses discordance between patient report and objectively measured walking impairment in people with peripheral artery disease without critical leg ischemia and how this discordance affects clinical care and scientific investigation.

This cohort study of 876 026 admissions investigates the association between facility-level Medicaid payer proportions and the incidence of nonelective admissions for chronic limb-threatening ischemia. This Teachable Moment discusses a woman in her 60s with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and smoking history who presented with bilateral, aching leg pain triggered by walking and relieved by rest. This post hoc analysis of the BIP randomized clinical trial evaluates the effect of a counseling intervention to encourage walking on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with peripheral artery disease. This prognostic study assesses the ability of machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes following endovascular intervention for peripheral artery disease. This randomized clinical trial of individuals with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease examines the effect of daily administered liraglutide on peripheral perfusion.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116UfGTc]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and interventions — because PAD manifests systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment targets both lower limb ischemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy, and patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments because the major PAD risk factors are used to calculate CVD risk.
