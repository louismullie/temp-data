## Question

Wellness exam

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the wellness exam, including its definition, purpose, evidence base, components, controversies, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the wellness exam and distinguishing it from a routine physical. Then, I should verify the core purpose and theoretical benefits. Next, I will appraise the evidence base, including mortality and morbidity outcomes. After that, I need to examine what actually happens during wellness visits and which components are evidence-based. I will then consider controversies, such as the value of routine pelvic exams and general health checks. Finally, I should translate this into practical, guideline-aligned implementation and summarize a balanced conclusion with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. A wellness exam, also called a well-woman or well-child visit or Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, is a preventive encounter focused on risk assessment, counseling, and evidence-based screening rather than a comprehensive head-to-toe physical examination, and it is distinct from a diagnostic visit or a problem-focused exam [^67d1485e] [^e0a5c868] [^9b2534b9].

> I need to check the stated purpose and potential benefits. The goals include updating risk profiles, delivering age- and risk-appropriate preventive services, counseling on lifestyle and reproductive planning, and strengthening the clinician–patient relationship; in older adults, the Medicare AWV also creates a personalized prevention plan and addresses functional status and cognitive concerns, though it is not a full physical exam [^67d1485e] [^e0a5c868] [^ba87db3d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outcomes; I should verify the evidence base. High-quality systematic reviews show that general health checks in adults do not reduce all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality, and may increase diagnoses and medication use without clear morbidity benefit, which tempers enthusiasm for routine comprehensive exams in asymptomatic adults [^f7d87d3c] [^12d86b7d]. But wait, what if wellness visits still improve process measures or downstream utilization? Observational Medicare data suggest AWVs are associated with increased uptake of preventive services and modest spending reductions, though confounding by healthy-user effects and access remains possible, so I should be cautious in attributing causality [^e47964ee] [^77245612].

> Next, I should review what actually happens during wellness visits to ensure we are not overstating content. Real-world studies show that clinicians discuss roughly 7 preventive services per visit and identify a small number of new diagnoses, while patients are often not up to date on all recommended services despite the visit, highlighting both the volume of preventive care and the persistence of gaps [^fabfe924]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline expectations: yes, wellness visits emphasize history, risk assessment, counseling, immunizations, and selective screening rather than routine comprehensive physical examinations [^67d1485e] [^e0a5c868].

> I will now examine which components are evidence-based and which are controversial. Let me consider routine pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women: ACOG advises shared decision-making given insufficient evidence of benefit and potential harms, and routine pelvic exams are not required for contraception initiation or STI screening when NAATs can be used, so I should avoid implying they are mandatory [^2a7f716e] [^7df59538]. For clinical breast examination, ACOG supports offering it in average-risk women within shared decision-making, acknowledging uncertain incremental benefit beyond mammography, so I need to frame it as optional and context-dependent [^5011ecd1]. For cardiorespiratory fitness, the AHA suggests estimating CRF at least annually using simple tools, but I should clarify that this is a recommendation to incorporate fitness assessment rather than a mandated test, and evidence linking routine CRF estimation to hard outcomes is indirect [^c730b970] [^a661e1dc].

> But wait, what about the physical examination itself; is it obsolete? Let me reconsider. While general health checks have not shown mortality benefit, targeted physical examination remains valuable when guided by history and risk, and emerging data suggest selective use of bedside ultrasound can enhance detection of relevant findings in certain settings, though this should not be generalized to all wellness visits yet [^5254970b] [^c26fa964]. I should confirm that ACOG still prioritizes a comprehensive history to determine whether breast or pelvic components are indicated at a given visit, reinforcing a tailored approach rather than a fixed routine [^67d1485e].

> Next, I should review practical implementation so recommendations are actionable. For adults, I need to ensure age- and risk-appropriate screening per USPSTF and specialty guidelines, document a health risk assessment, update immunizations, and use shared decision-making for discretionary elements like pelvic or breast exams; for Medicare beneficiaries, I should structure the AWV to include the required elements such as HRA, functional and cognitive screening, and advance care planning, and consider team-based delivery to expand capacity [^e0a5c868] [^ba87db3d]. For women, I should integrate reproductive life planning and align testing with current and future reproductive goals, and for adolescents, I should incorporate confidential risk assessment and counseling, including sexual health and STI/HIV prevention, within the medical home framework [^67d1485e] [^dca9e548].

> I should double-check special populations and controversies so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, routine well-child visits remain standard, and while the genitourinary exam is commonly documented, its yield varies and performance may be influenced by documentation practices, so I need to balance thoroughness with patient comfort and clinical relevance [^f981d255] [^cb12f7d4]. In obesity care, a focused obesity-specific history and physical examination are recommended to identify complications and guide therapy, which justifies a more detailed exam in that context even if it is not universally required in generic wellness visits [^77945991] [^e21fc411].

> Let me synthesize a balanced conclusion, but I should verify that it matches the evidence. Wellness exams are best viewed as preventive platforms for risk assessment, counseling, and evidence-based screening, with modest process and potential utilization benefits, but without proven reductions in mortality from general health checks; therefore, I should emphasize selective, guideline-concordant components, shared decision-making for discretionary exams, and team-based strategies to close preventive care gaps rather than routine comprehensive physical examinations for all [^f7d87d3c] [^12d86b7d] [^fabfe924] [^67d1485e].

A wellness exam is a **preventive visit** focused on risk assessment, screening, and counseling to maintain health and detect disease early [^67d1485e]. It is **not a problem-focused visit** and typically does not include a full physical exam unless indicated by history or risk factors [^e0a5c868]. Core elements include a comprehensive history, vital signs, age- and risk-based screenings (blood pressure, cholesterol, cancer, STIs), immunizations, and lifestyle counseling (diet, activity, mental health) [^67d1485e] [^b9467e7f]. Routine pelvic or breast exams are not universally recommended and should be individualized via shared decision-making [^2a7f716e] [^5011ecd1]. Wellness exams improve preventive care uptake but have **limited direct evidence** for mortality reduction, so they should be tailored to patient risk, preferences, and evidence-based guidelines [^e47964ee] [^f7d87d3c].

---

## Purpose and objectives

The primary goals of a wellness exam are to:

- **Assess health status**: Identify risk factors, early signs of disease, and lifestyle behaviors that impact health [^67d1485e].
- **Provide preventive care**: Deliver age- and risk-appropriate screenings, immunizations, and counseling [^9b2534b9].
- **Establish patient-provider rapport**: Build trust and facilitate open communication about health concerns [^1507f0c7].
- **Empower patients**: Educate and engage patients in shared decision-making and self-care [^9b2534b9].

---

## Key components of a wellness exam

### Comprehensive history

A thorough history is foundational and includes:

- **Medical history**: Past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies, and chronic conditions [^67d1485e].
- **Family history**: Genetic predispositions to chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) [^488cb6c3].
- **Social history**: Smoking, alcohol, drug use, diet, physical activity, occupational exposures, and social determinants of health [^notfound].
- **Reproductive history**: Menstrual history, pregnancies, contraceptive use, and sexual health [^67d1485e].
- **Mental health**: Mood, anxiety, stress, and sleep patterns [^e0a5c868].

---

### Physical examination

The physical exam is **selective and risk-based**, not routine or comprehensive [^67d1485e]. It may include:

- **Vital signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, height, weight, BMI [^notfound].
- **General appearance**: Nutritional status, hydration, and overall well-being [^notfound].
- **Focused examinations**: Based on history and risk factors (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurological) [^notfound].

---

### Screening tests and immunizations

Screening and immunizations are **individualized** by age, sex, and risk:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Blood pressure <br/> - Lipid panel <br/> - ECG if indicated [^b080ffc5] |
| Cancer | - Mammography <br/> - Cervical cytology/HPV <br/> - Colonoscopy <br/> - Prostate-specific antigen (shared decision-making) [^bc123100] [^08920ec1] |
| Infectious diseases | - HIV <br/> - Hepatitis C <br/> - STI screening <br/> - Tuberculosis (if indicated) [^38581682] |
| Immunizations | - Influenza <br/> - Tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis <br/> - HPV <br/> - Pneumococcal <br/> - Shingles <br/> - COVID-19 [^notfound] |

---

### Counseling and health education

Counseling is a **core element**, addressing:

- **Lifestyle behaviors**: Diet, physical activity, weight management, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation [^b9467e7f].
- **Mental health**: Stress management, anxiety, depression screening, and resources [^e0a5c868].
- **Sexual and reproductive health**: Contraception, fertility, menopause, and safe sex practices [^6b371e0f].
- **Chronic disease management**: Education on conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [^notfound].

---

## Frequency and timing

Frequency is **guided by age, risk, and guidelines**: annual visits are common for adults, though some services are not needed yearly [^f67f8f30]; adolescents and young adults benefit from annual visits for developmental and preventive needs [^notfound]; Medicare beneficiaries have access to an Annual Wellness Visit after their first 12 months of Part B coverage [^e0a5c868].

---

## Controversies and limitations

- **Evidence base**: General health checks have limited evidence for reducing mortality or morbidity, though they improve preventive service uptake [^f7d87d3c] [^e47964ee].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Routine screenings may lead to false positives, overtreatment, and patient anxiety [^1eef7254].
- **Resource utilization**: Time and costs can be substantial, especially with low-yield tests [^3f9d3429].
- **Patient preferences**: Some patients may prefer less frequent or more targeted visits, emphasizing shared decision-making [^2a7f716e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric wellness exams**: Focus on growth, development, immunizations, and age-appropriate screenings (e.g. vision, hearing, developmental milestones) [^notfound].
- **Geriatric wellness exams**: Emphasize functional status, fall risk, cognitive screening, and advance care planning [^e0a5c868].
- **Cultural competence**: Tailor care to patient values, beliefs, and language preferences [^e272fd53].

---

## Conclusion

A wellness exam is a **preventive, patient-centered visit** that prioritizes risk assessment, evidence-based screening, and counseling to maintain health and detect disease early. It is not a comprehensive physical exam; components are individualized by age, sex, and risk, with shared decision-making to balance benefits and harms. While wellness exams improve preventive care delivery, their impact on hard outcomes is modest, underscoring the need for evidence-based, patient-tailored practice.

### The annual physical examination: important or time to abandon? [^5659dcde]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination combined with provider belief that the physical examination is both of proven value and can detect subclinical illness have led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country. The authors review the current forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the current recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.

### The obstetrician-gynecologist workforce and access for well-woman examinations: what, when, where, and by whom? [^caa6abc0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Well-woman or wellness examinations remain an integral part of outpatient gynecologic care. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that a woman should see her obstetrician-gynecologist (OB/GYN) at least once yearly. The median time to see a general OB/GYN for a new well-woman examination is now 42 days in large metropolitan markets. Despite growth in the number of OB/GYN residency positions, there has been no increase in the number of graduates pursuing general OB/GYN care, as more are pursuing subspecialty training. This shortage of OB/GYN generalist physicians will likely increase, placing more importance on team-based care.

### Do new guidelines and technology make the routine pelvic examination obsolete? [^fbea6f77]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Routine pelvic examinations are the core of the periodic gynecological examination and widely tolerated as a necessary part of health maintenance. Is this examination beneficial for asymptomatic women? Justifications for the pelvic examination include screening for Chlamydia (or gonorrhea) infection, evaluation before initiation of hormonal contraception, screening for cervical cancer, and early detection of ovarian cancer. Current nucleic acid amplification tests for Chlamydia and gonorrhea permit the use of urine and self-administered vaginal swabs, which most women prefer over a pelvic examination. Pelvic examination findings do not affect the decision to prescribe or withhold systemic hormonal contraception; a pelvic examination is not needed to initiate these contraceptives. Recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend less frequent cervical screening, thus decreasing the frequency of a speculum examination for cervical screening. Bimanual examinations for palpation of the uterus and ovaries are also routinely performed in the United States. Clinical trial data, however, show these examinations do not lead to earlier detection of ovarian cancer. No evidence identifies benefits of a pelvic examination in the early diagnosis of other conditions in the asymptomatic woman. Speculum and bimanual examinations are uncomfortable, disliked by many women, and use scarce time during a well woman visit. Eliminating the speculum examination from most visits and the bimanual examination from all visits of asymptomatic women will free resources to provide services of proven benefit. Overuse of the pelvic examination contributes to high healthcare costs without any compensatory health benefit.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^67d1485e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive history and physical examination — core elements specify that a comprehensive history is one of the most important aspects of a well-woman visit, including symptoms; medications; allergies; and medical, surgical, family, social, and gynecologic history with questions on reproductive, sexual, and mental health. Taking this comprehensive history will inform whether components of the physical examination, including breast or pelvic examination, are indicated at that visit and will inform shared decision making for these examinations.

### Physician health and wellness [^d332af9a]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Individual components of wellness — healthy habits and activities — are presented as emerging approaches across training stages, noting that physicians who incorporate healthy lifestyle habits have been perceived as more credible and motivating to their patients as well as the residents under their supervision, and that physician wellness activities frequently include hobbies, physical activity, sleep, nutrition, and vacations; wellness behaviors are additive, and thus, physicians should be encouraged to adopt a variety of approaches to best suit their individual needs and preferences.

### Importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice: a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^c730b970]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measurement — general recommendations for routine clinical visits specify that at a minimum, all adults should have CRF estimated each year using a nonexercise algorithm during their annual healthcare examination, and clinicians may consider submaximal exercise tests or field tests as alternatives. Ideally, all adults should have CRF estimated using a maximal test; if feasible using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX), on a regular basis similar to other preventative services, although the specific age of first assessment and schedule for follow-up are yet to be established. Patients with higher cardiovascular disease risk profiles should have an initial test at an earlier age and be tested more frequently than patients with lower risk profiles, and adults with chronic disease should have CRF measured with a peak or symptom-limited CPX on a regular basis.

### An ultrasound screening exam during Medicare wellness visits may Be beneficial [^c26fa964]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The physical exam component of a periodic health visit in the elderly has not been considered useful. Standard Medicare Wellness visits require no physical exam beyond blood pressure and most physicians perform limited exams during these visits. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, potential benefit, and costs of performing a screening ultrasound (US) exam during Medicare Wellness visits.

Methods

A physician examiner at an academic internal medicine primary care clinic performed a screening US exam targeting important abnormalities of patients 65-85years old during a Medicare Wellness visit. The primary care physician (PCP) recorded the follow-up items for each abnormality identified by the US examiner and assessed the benefit of each abnormality for the participant. Abnormality benefit, net exam benefit per participant, follow-up items and costs, participant survey results, and exam duration were assessed.

Results

Participants numbered 108. Total abnormalities numbered 283 and new diagnoses were 172. Positive benefit scores were assigned to 38.8%, neutral (zero) scores to 59.4%, and negative benefit scores to 1.8% of abnormalities. Net benefit scores per participant were positive in 63.9%, 0 in 34.3%, and negative in 1.8%. Follow-up items were infrequent resulting in 76% of participants without follow-up cost. Participant survey showed excellent acceptance of the exam.

Conclusions

The US screening exam identified frequent abnormalities in Medicare Wellness patients. The assessed benefits were rarely negative and often mild to moderately positive, with important new chronic conditions identified. Follow-up costs were low when the PCPs were also US experts.

### Physician health and wellness [^dcdffceb]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Physician health and wellness — organizational strategies and national progress emphasize that self-awareness is paramount to physician well-being, and research, education, and open discussion about the early warning signs of physician and trainee distress is needed. Physicians and organizations can also consider routine self-monitoring for symptoms using validated burnout assessment tools, which can be chosen based on the physicians' preferred length, metrics, validation, and cost. Within organizations, confidentiality must be ensured, and well-organized programs must be available to provide effective pathways to help physicians struggling with burnout without fear of negative professional consequences. Substantial efforts have focused on reduction of burnout prevalence over the past decade, and the national medical community has (A) attempted to standardize a definition of physician wellness; this goal also remains elusive, and given the multifactorial nature of health, any approach to physician well-being necessarily requires a nuanced and multipronged approach. A systematic review demonstrated that studies of physician wellness typically measure at least 1 aspect of physical, mental, social, spiritual, and integrated well-being. A central theme of this clinical report is the recommendation and hope that organizational leaders and individual physicians will use a comprehensive approach to well-being and address the full range of factors affecting health, including mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, financial, and societal factors related to physician well-being.

### Neuropsychological comparison of incident MCI and prevalent MCI [^53deca5b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Also relevant is predicting progression from normal aging to MCI. Earliest prediction is crucial for earlier treatment, which is especially important when a curative therapy is developed. A variety of indicators have been evaluated including physical indicators, imaging markers, cognitive markers, subjective complaints, and emotional symptoms. This study demonstrates the value of longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, especially in those who are asymptomatic but potentially at risk for development of cognitive decline. The use of longitudinal neuropsychological examinations allowed for earlier identification of clinical change and therefore earlier clinical diagnosis, an important preamble to treatment strategies that target the earliest disease stage of a neurocognitive disorder.

Strategies to detect prevalent MCI sooner could include more routine cognitive screen in older adults as well as more routine referral of adults with cognitive complaints for neuropsychological evaluation. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit requires a review of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs as well as detecting cognitive impairment (primarily by self or other report) but does not recommend actual objective assessment of cognitive functioning. However, in MCI, ADLs and instrumental ADLs are, by definition, not significantly impacted, and it can be difficult to distinguish MCI from normal cognitive changes when considering subjective reports. Thus, utilization of objective measures of cognitive function more routinely in older adults may help diagnose prevalent cases sooner. This may include a formal mental status examination by a primary physician or a lower bar for sending individuals with subjective complaints for neuropsychological evaluation. Earlier objective evaluation may identify prevalent MCI cases sooner by documenting very mild impairment sooner or, if the examination is normal, by establishing a baseline assessment that may allow for earlier detection in longitudinal assessment if cognitive concerns continue.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 754: the utility of and indications for routine pelvic examination [^2a7f716e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pelvic examination — recommendations and shared decision making for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women note that "Data from these studies are inadequate to support a recommendation for or against performing a routine screening pelvic examination among asymptomatic, nonpregnant women who are not at increased risk of any specific gynecologic condition" and "Data on its effectiveness for screening for other gynecologic conditions are lacking", so "the decision to perform a pelvic examination should be a shared decision between the patient and her obstetrician–gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider", and "Counseling should include a discussion about the uncertainty of the benefits and harms of the procedure and the lack of evidence for the screening pelvic examination". "A study of 452 women (aged 21–65 years)… reported that 94% of women thought the potential benefits and harms of the pelvic examination should be discussed before an examination takes place". "It is recommended by ACOG that pelvic examinations be performed when indicated by medical history or symptoms", with "Examples of symptoms that indicate a woman should receive a pelvic examination include but are not limited to the following: abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, vaginal dryness, vaginal bulge, urinary issues, or inability to insert a tampon", and "Other indications include patients undergoing a pelvic procedure (eg, endometrial biopsy or intrauterine device placement)". Additionally, "Women with current or a history of cervical dysplasia, gynecologic malignancy, or in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure should be screened and managed according to guidelines specific to those gynecologic conditions", and "Obstetrician–gynecologists should make efforts to obtain accurate and complete medical, surgical, and family histories and to conduct thorough reviews of systems as part of a well-woman visit", with the note that "When an asymptomatic, nonpregnant patient presents for a well-woman visit, the obstetrician–gynecologist should explain the lack of data and potential benefits".

### The normal newborn exam, or is it? [^c004fb63]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the broad technologic advancements of medicine, screening for illness in infants is highly reliant on a complete physical exam. For this reason it is critical that the examining physician not only have a thorough understanding of abnormal findings but also the normal findings and their variants. The vast majority of infants are healthy and findings predictive of future health problems are subtle and infrequent. Yet, outcomes can be devastating. Therefore it is critical the physician remain diligent when screening for these. It is our hope that this article will assist you in this task and allow for more accurate and timely diagnosis that prevents or minimizes long-term health problems in children.

### National alliance of sickle cell centers consensus recommendations on sickle cell disease health maintenance: a consensus statement [^9dc70fa9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) routine health maintenance — annual comprehensive visit emphasizes that the annual comprehensive SCD visit will be a longer, 1-hour visit that should occur with an SCD specialist and be consistent throughout the person's life, and this visit should be conducted at baseline (when they are well, without an acute care visit in the preceding 2 weeks or during an acute pain crisis). These visits include a review of the acute care visits over the prior year, accounting of episodic transfusions, and identification of new complications; the visit is also to make adjustments to current SCD modifying therapies, ensure preventative screenings are up to date, and address new concerns. This visit should always include the SCD social worker. The medical history should include pain assessment (frequency, severity, duration, location, treatments including efficacy or adverse effects) and opioid use in morphine equivalents, and a full review of systems is needed including organ-system symptom screening as well as assessing physical activity. A complete physical examination must include a focused neurologic examination, gait assessment, and musculoskeletal examination, and vital signs including blood pressure and oxygen saturation should be measured, as well as height and weight.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 754: the utility of and indications for routine pelvic examination [^7df59538]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Routine pelvic examination — conclusion and care approach centers on annual well-woman care, lack of ovarian cancer mortality benefit from pelvic exams, and shared decision making. Regardless of whether a pelvic examination is performed, a woman should see her obstetrician–gynecologist at least once a year for well-woman care, and studies show that pelvic examinations do not decrease ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality rates; a pelvic examination is not necessary before initiating or prescribing contraception, other than an intrauterine device, or to screen for STIs, and if a patient is asymptomatic the decision to perform an exam should follow discussion of potential risks and benefits and be based on shared decision making.

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^1be57a14]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Preparticipation medical clearance — screening guidance states that the routine referral of asymptomatic middle-aged and older individuals for medical clearance before starting an exercise program appears unwarranted and presents needless barriers to exercise adoption, whereas physically inactive individuals with known cardiovascular, metabolic or renal disease, or signs/symptoms suggestive of these diseases should seek medical attention before starting an exercise program, regardless of the intensity.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^a6ff44c0]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination — healthy lifestyle patient education — A healthy diet and regular exercise are important to good eye health. CONSENSUS-BASED ACTION STATEMENT: Eye doctors should counsel their patients on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and remain alert for new research that demonstrates the effects of diet and exercise on ocular and general health. Evidence Quality states that an evaluation of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation was not conducted for this guideline, and the Benefits and Harms Assessment notes that implementation is likely to increase patient awareness of the value of a healthy diet and exercise on their eye and general health and that the benefits were established by expert consensus opinion.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^488cb6c3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

A well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. Given the shifting and complex landscape of care, in which many women may not receive all the recommended preventive services, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to contribute to the overall health and well-being of women throughout the lifespan by providing recommended preventive services and counseling. Taking a comprehensive history (specifically obtaining detailed information on symptoms and past medical and gynecologic history) will inform if certain components of the physical examination, including breast or pelvic examination, are indicated at that visit and will inform shared decision making for these examinations. Family history should be used as a risk assessment tool and should be completed and updated regularly to ensure the most comprehensive assessment of a woman's personal risk factors. Another key component of a well-woman visit for a reproductive-aged woman is the development and discussion of her reproductive life plan to ensure that medical testing and treatments provided are aligned with her current and future plans. Obstetrician-gynecologists provide care for women across the lifespan, and periodic well-woman visits are appropriate and necessary for perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women as well. This Committee Opinion has been revised to reflect updated guidance on components of the physical examination and new sources for well-woman preventive services.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^e3793d91]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — Other organizations' positions on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults are described: The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults, and the American Academy of Neurology has published guidance on the detection of cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommends the use of a brief, validated cognitive assessment instrument to assess for cognitive impairment.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 754: the utility of and indications for routine pelvic examination [^1eef7254]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pelvic examination — potential benefits, harms, and patient perceptions indicate that "Based on expert opinion, potential benefits of the pelvic examination include early detection of treatable gynecologic conditions before symptoms occurring (eg, vulvar or vaginal cancer), as well as incidental findings such as dermatologic changes and foreign bodies", and in the well-woman context examinations "may allow gynecologists to explain a patient's anatomy, reassure her of normalcy, and answer her specific questions, thus establishing open communication". Patient preference data show "one study of 262 adult women (aged 21–65 years) reported that 62% of respondents believed that the bimanual examination helped establish open communication with their gynecologic care provider, and 82% believed that the examination provided reassurance about their health". Potential harms are described with low-quality evidence: "The ACP found low-quality evidence that the screening pelvic examination leads to harms such as fear, anxiety, embarrassment (reports ranged from 10% to 80% of women) or pain and discomfort (from 11% to 60%)", and the USPSTF "found little evidence on the harms of screening", noting that "very few studies reported false-positive and false-negative rates for other gynecologic conditions" and "no studies quantified the amount of anxiety associated with screening pelvic examinations".

### Physical examination and evaluation for comorbidities in youth with obesity [^07bebfa0]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a complex and chronic disease that can affect the entire body. The review of systems and physical examination are important components of the evaluation. Laboratory assessment is directed toward known cardiometabolic comorbidities. Regular follow-up visits with repeated review of systems, physical examination, and laboratory testing can facilitate early detection and management of comorbidities of this chronic disease.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^6b371e0f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Well-woman visit — abstract guidance emphasizes that a well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. Taking a comprehensive history (specifically obtaining detailed information on symptoms and past medical and gynecologic history) will inform if certain components of the physical examination, including breast or pelvic examination, are indicated at that visit and will inform shared decision making for these examinations. Family history should be used as a risk assessment tool and should be completed and updated regularly to ensure the most comprehensive assessment of a woman's personal risk factors. Another key component of a well-woman visit for a reproductive-aged woman is the development and discussion of her reproductive life plan to ensure that medical testing and treatments provided are aligned with her current and future plans. Obstetrician–gynecologists provide care for women across the lifespan, and periodic well-woman visits are appropriate and necessary for perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women as well.

### Committee opinion no. 534: well-woman visit [^1507f0c7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The annual health assessment ("annual examination") is a fundamental part of medical care and is valuable in promoting prevention practices, recognizing risk factors for disease, identifying medical problems, and establishing the clinician–patient relationship. The annual health assessment should include screening, evaluation and counseling, and immunizations based on age and risk factors. The interval for specific individual services and the scope of services provided may vary in different ambulatory care settings. The performance of a physical examination is a key part of an annual health assessment visit, and the components of that examination may vary depending on the patient's age, risk factors, and physician preference. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists explains the need for annual assessments and provides guidelines regarding some important elements of the annual examination; specifically, when to perform pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women, including when to start internal pelvic and speculum examinations, and when to initiate formal clinical breast examinations.

### Obstetrics and gynecology residents' perspectives on wellness: findings from a national survey [^ff5ae728]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residents' perceptions of wellness, burnout, and perceived effectiveness of wellness programming.

Methods

In January 2017, a six-item survey was administered at the time of the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology in-training examination. Respondents voluntarily completed the survey electronically before starting the examination, and responses were anonymous and only linked to postgraduate year.

Results

Of the 5,376 eligible U.S. examinees, 4,999 (93%) completed the survey, provided residency year status, and were included in the analysis. There was a high prevalence of self-identified wellness problems (burnout 51.2%, depression 32.0%, binge drinking 12.6%, eating disorder 4.7%, drug use 1.1%, and suicide attempt 0.4%). First-year residents were most likely to state that wellness was a priority in their program. The number of residents reporting any problem with wellness increases significantly between the first year (49.8%) and second year (63.7%, P < .001), after which it remains elevated throughout training. Residents who responded that wellness was not a priority in their program were more likely to report wellness issues and burnout (P < .001). When asked what single intervention all residency programs should provide, 41.2% (2,059) felt that dedicated time for wellness maintenance was the most important intervention.

Conclusion

These findings highlight the high prevalence of wellness problems in obstetrics and gynecology residents, and how essential it will be to engage learners in the development of effective, evidence-based interventions.

### The new why when designing mandatory medical examinations [^874665c5]. Occupational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Secondly, and in line with the first point, we assume that the assessment of health complaints or diseases alone cannot be sufficient to detect workers with possible and relevant work limitations, given the precise requirements. We need specific signal questions in which certain relevant health complaints are coupled to decreased ability given the defined requirements needed for performing the job demands. This is why job-specific medical examinations with more precise questions included in the examination protocol with direct association to the defined requirements were developed.

Thirdly, the 'standard' solution in medical examination protocols of including clinical tests normally used to build a diagnostic framework (i.e. blood testing, urine testing, X-rays, etc.) is questionable and might not be the instruments needed in the preventive medical setting. Neither is it logical either because with mandatory medicals it is the physician who invites a worker for an exam ination while in the classic medical setting the patient will visit the doctor or hospital due to health problems.

Fourthly, we assume that the better the medical exam ination is tailored to the job demands and health and safety requirements, the more likely it is that an occupational physician can take valid decisions and provide tailored advice to keep workers in the job and fit for work: this should be seen as the ultimate goal, while most classical medical protocols might end with the decision that an individual worker is 'unfit for the job'. Here is where the ' new why ' is obvious: the assessment of the medical fitness for work is not a goal in itself, because it should be maintained by timely interventions to remove health or safety issues, improve work limitations or sustain work ability. The interventions are also standardized, as are the tests and test outcomes.

This way of thinking is not typically Dutch. In research, several authors argue along the same lines when researching classical examples of jobs with high physical demands for which mandatory medical examinations have been redesigned, such as for firefighters and policemen. Jamnik et al. published work to explain how in Canada legally defensible employment standards for prominent physically demanding public safety occupations could be developed and practised. Tipton et al. expanded the processes involved in establishing minimum occupational fitness standards, highlighting the interplay that occurs between the choice of measurements and the decision that follows.

### Physical examination findings among children and adolescents with obesity: an evidence-based review [^e21fc411]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity affects 1 in 3 US children and adolescents. Clinical recommendations have largely focused on screening guidelines and counseling strategies. However, the physical examination of the child or adolescent with obesity can provide the clinician with additional information to guide management decisions. This expert-based review focuses on physical examination findings specific to children and adolescents with obesity. For each physical examination element, the authors define the finding and its prevalence among pediatric patients with obesity, discuss the importance and relevance of the finding, describe known techniques to assess severity, and review evidence regarding the need for additional evaluation. The recommendations presented represent a comprehensive review of current evidence as well as expert opinion. The goal of this review is to highlight the importance of conducting a targeted physical examination during pediatric weight management visits.

### Evolution of the World Health Organization semen analysis manual: where are we? [^662c1a50]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO (World Health Organization) manuals provide state-of-the-art guidance on how a semen analysis should be carried out. The much anticipated sixth edition of the WHO semen analysis manual has been released 10 years after its previous version and includes essential updates, such as new reference standards for semen volume and microscopic sperm characteristics of recent fathers. A well-conducted semen analysis remains an essential foundation of the infertility evaluation process and affects patient referral, diagnosis and treatment. However, a male infertility work-up primarily based on routine semen analysis does not provide men with an optimal fertility pathway; the primary reasons for routine semen analysis inadequacy in this context include its low predictive value for natural and assisted conception success, its inability to detect sperm DNA and epigenetic deficiencies that might negatively affect embryo development, implantation and offspring well-being, and the substantial overlap between semen parameters of fertile and subfertile individuals. Ideally, a full andrological assessment should be carried out by reproductive urologists in all men dealing with couple infertility and should include a detailed history analysis, physical examination, semen analysis, endocrine assessment and other tests as needed. Only through a complete male infertility work-up will relevant underlying medical and infertility conditions be revealed and potentially treated or alleviated. The ultimate goals of a comprehensive andrological assessment are to positively influence overall male health, pregnancy prospects and offspring well-being.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^9b2534b9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — well-woman visit recommendations and conclusions state that a well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. The periodic well-woman care visit should include screening, evaluation and counseling, and immunizations based on age and risk factors. The interval for specific individual services may differ for individual patients, and the scope of services provided may vary in different ambulatory care settings. Team-based care, including obstetrician–gynecologists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other health care professionals, may facilitate meeting the needs of preventive care for women. A comprehensive history is one of the most important aspects of a well-woman visit. Although components of a physical examination may not be required at a well-woman visit, obstetrician–gynecologists can play a critical role in engaging patients in shared decision making, encouraging and facilitating healthy behaviors, and counseling about a wide array of effective preventive health practices.

### Understanding the value of the wellness visit: a descriptive study [^fabfe924]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical preventive services can reduce mortality and morbidity, but Americans receive only half of the recommended care. Although wellness visits protect time for clinicians to review needs and discuss care with patients, studies have not shown that having a wellness visit improves health outcomes. This study seeks to understand the types of discussions and volume of care delivered during wellness visits.

Methods

Using a sample of 1,008 patients scheduled for a wellness visit from 22 primary care clinicians across 3 states from 2018 to 2019, electronic health records were reviewed, and a subset of visits was audio recorded. The discussion and delivery of clinical preventive services, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, were measured, and new diagnoses were identified from the clinical preventive services. Analyses were completed in 2020.

Results

Even though patients were up to date with 80% of the recommended clinical preventive services 3 months after the visit, only 0.5% of patients were up to date with all the recommended clinical preventive services. On average, 6.9 clinical preventive service discussions occurred during each wellness visit on the basis of electronic health records review, and 7.7 clinical preventive services discussions occurred on the basis of audio recordings. An average of 0.4 new diagnoses was identified, including cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular risks, and infections.

Conclusions

Wellness visits are an important time for patients and clinicians to discuss prevention strategies and to deliver recommended clinical preventive services, leading to the identification of previously unrecognized diagnoses. This will improve patients' health. Policies and incentives that promote wellness visits are important, and efforts are needed to deliver them to those most in need.

### A guide to implementing and coding Medicare's annual wellness visit… [^e0a5c868]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The Annual Wellness Visit allows practices to gain information about the patient, including medical and family history, health risks, and specific vitals. Not to be confused with a complete physical examination, the purpose of the AWV is to review the patient's wellness and develop a personalized prevention plan. The services provided during the AWV are different from a typical preventive care visit and expand to include emotional and psychological well-being, in addition to the patient's physical well-being. The AWV provides an opportunity for physicians to improve the quality of care, assist in patient engagement, and optimize payment opportunities. Health Care Professionals Who May Furnish and Bill AWV: Non-physicians must legally be authorized and qualified to provide AWVs in the state in which the services are furnished.

The Initial Preventive Physical Examination /Welcome to Medicare Preventive Visit is a once per lifetime benefit that may be provided only within the first 12 months of enrollment in Medicare Part B. The AWV is covered only after the first 12 months of Medicare Part B coverage have passed. The AWV can be provided annually once per 12-month period thereafter. Yes. The patient may be asked to complete portions of the IPPE or AWV prior to the appointment, such as demographic information and self-assessment of health status. The AAFP's FPM Journal has several patient surveys and questionnaires for patients and/or your staff to complete.

### Time to add a fifth pillar to bedside physical examination: inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and insonation [^5254970b]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation have been the 4 pillars of clinical bedside medicine. Although these basic methods of physical examination have served us well, traditional bedside examination, for a number of reasons including diminishing interest and expertise, performs well less than what is required of a modern diagnostic strategy. Improving the performance of physical examination is vital given that it is crucial to guide diagnostic possibilities and further testing. Current efforts at improving physical examination skills during medical training have not been very successful, and incorporating appropriate technology at the bedside might improve its performance. Selective use of bedside ultrasound (or insonation) can be one such strategy that could be incorporated as the fifth component of the physical examination. Seeing pathology through imaging might improve interest in physical examination among trainees, and permit appropriate downstream testing and possibly superior decision making. Current ultrasound technology makes this feasible, and further miniaturization of ultrasound devices and reduced cost will allow for routine use at the bedside. It is time to have a wider debate and a possible consensus about updates required to enhance current paradigms of physical examination.

### Changes in health care access and preventive health screenings by race and ethnicity [^b080ffc5]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

We examined measures of health care access and preventive health screenings. Measures of health care access included the proportion of adults having a usual place of care, having a wellness visit within the past year (including physical examinations and general-purpose checkups), delaying medical care due to cost, and not receiving medical care due to cost during the past year. Preventive health screening measures included the proportion of eligible adults receiving a blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood glucose screening (inclusive of screenings performed outside of a traditional wellness visit) as well as colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer screenings within the past year.

All adults were considered eligible for blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, while adults without a diagnosis of diabetes were considered eligible for blood glucose screening. We used the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines to determine eligibility for cancer screenings as of 2019, which included all adults aged 50 to 75 years for colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy), female adults aged 21 to 65 years for cervical cancer screening (Papanicolaou smear or human papillomavirus test), female adults aged 50 to 74 years for breast cancer screening (mammography), and male adults aged 55 to 69 years for prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen test).

Advances in technology have reshaped the practice of medicine. These changes have greatly benefited our patients. However, in the setting of these advances, the importance of basic clinical tools is more pertinent than ever. Despite the growing reliance on technology, the physical exam remains valuable and cost effective, often enabling the well-trained clinician to arrive at the diagnosis, rapidly and accurately. The physical exam must not become a relic of a distant past. We aim to investigate current competency and proficiency, proposals for change in teaching curriculums, and the relationship with technology such as hand-held echocardiography. A skillful exam provides both emotional and intellectual satisfaction. It may be a lost art but it is well worth the effort to restore.

### Follow-up in breast cancer: does routine clinical examination improve outcome? A systematic review of the literature [^038762fb]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Multiple guidelines exist for the follow-up of breast cancer, with no agreement on frequency or duration. The contribution of routine clinical examination for the detection of potentially treatable relapse, and the impact this has on survival, is unknown. In this study, we systematically review the literature to establish the proportion of potentially treatable locoregional relapses and new contralateral breast cancers detected by clinical examination, mammography and patient self-examination. We analyse whether method of detection of relapse influences outcome. The methods used were systematic review of the literature. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Web of Sciences and EBM reviews were the data sources for the systematic review. All studies with information on proportion of relapses detected by clinical examination, mammography and self-examination were included. A total of 30–40% of potentially treatable relapses are detected by patient self-examination. In studies published before 2000, 15% of such relapse is mammographically detected with 46% detected by routine clinical examination. In those published after 2000, 40% are mammographically detected with 15% detected on routine clinical examination. Patients with ipsilateral breast relapse detected clinically appear to do less well than those with relapse detected by self-examination or mammography. Routine clinical surveillance is responsible for detection of fewer potentially treatable relapses in more modern cohorts as experience with mammography increases. There is no evidence to suggest that clinical examination confers a survival advantage compared with other methods of detection. The data in this analysis suggest that a review of the guidelines on follow-up after breast cancer should be undertaken.

### Hospital utilization and expenditures among a nationally representative sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 2 years after receipt of an annual wellness visit [^77245612]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Medicare's Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) provides an opportunity to link beneficiaries to cancer screenings and immunizations, however, research has not examined its effectiveness. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of receiving an AWV on outcomes while accounting for the healthy user effect. This study used 2013–2017 Medicare claims data to compare hospital utilization and total expenditures among a 5% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries with and without AWV use in 2014 (228,053 AWV users were propensity-score matched to 228,053 nonusers). Linear fixed effects regression models examined differences in study outcomes 12 and 24 months after AWV use, controlling for baseline differences in sociodemographics, health status, utilization, and accountable care organization attribution. The proportion of Medicare FFS beneficiaries that used the AWV increased from 13% in 2013 to 24% in 2017. Users of the AWV had a marginally significant reduction in Medicare spending 12 months (-$122, 95% CI -$256, $11, p = 0.073) and significant reductions (-$162, 95% CI, -$310, -$14, p = 0.032) 24 months after the visit, relative to non-users. However it remains unclear what is driving these savings as there was no change in hospital-related utilization and results may still be biased due to inherent differences between users and non-users. The AWV provides an opportunity for providers to focus on prevention and geriatric needs not covered in typical office visits. Practices adopting AWVs have noted increased revenue, more stable patient populations, and stronger provider-patient relationships. While utilization remains low, it is steadily increasing over time.

### Age-friendly health care and the 4Ms in RN-led annual wellness visits [^442a0154]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Medicare annual wellness visits (AWVs) are prevention-focused healthcare visits free to Medicare recipients. These visits focus on health maintenance, health risk assessment, prevention of illness, and maintaining independence, all of which are within the scope of registered nurse (RN) practice as well as aligned with what matters, medication, mentation, and mobility - the 4Ms - of age-friendly health care. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the implementation of the 4Ms in the context of RN-led Medicare AWVs in a primary care practice.

Methods

In a primary care practice with approximately 2500 patients, including approximately 571 of whom were enrolled in Medicare, RN-led Medicare AWVs were implemented, incorporating the 4Ms framework. During this time, data were collected on the effect of the AWV on access to care-conceptualized here as the number of visits available as well as the type of clinician open to staff these visits. Data collection also included patient responses to the 4Ms question "what matters most?"

Results

Overall, the RN-led visits were successful and beneficial to the practice. Each RN-led visit allowed for 2 additional acute or monitoring visits per provider (nurse practitioner, MD) per day, increasing patient access to their primary care providers. Inclusion of the 4Ms questions facilitated discussion around overall mental and emotional well-being, life stressors, quality of life, and goals of care.

Conclusion

RN-led Medicare AWVs incorporating the 4Ms framework enhances the role of RNs in primary care by focusing on a health promotion role, utilizing RNs to their full scope of practice. RN-led AWVs increase provider availability for acute and chronic care appointments, as well as foster conversations around quality of life, as well as mental and emotional well-being.

### Assessment of physician priorities in delivery of preventive care [^3f9d3429]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although professional guidelines encourage preventive care, 32 major evidence-based services are available for nonpregnant adults, and delivery of all services is difficult. Just 8% of US adults attain all guideline-recommended services. Although patient nonadherence is an important factor, in many practice settings, physicians also have limited time to discuss preventive care. To fully evaluate and implement all preventive care guidelines, physicians would need to devote an estimated 7 hours per day to primary prevention. However, clinicians spend just 27% of their day in direct clinical care. These factors potentially force physicians to prioritize guideline recommendations.

Which preventive services are most often discussed and whether priorities differ by physician remains unknown. Physicians may prioritize care in different ways, such as improving length of life, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness. However, clinical decision supports focused on these priorities are limited. Instead, physicians must rely on personal impressions of the benefits and harms of each preventive service, taking into account differences across patients in risk factors. Mathematical models have been used to rank preventive services based on the potential to add life-years, improve quality of life, or lower costs, but how these rankings compare with clinical practice is unknown. Finally, prioritization could be more important in short encounters compared with longer annual wellness visits. Our goal was to understand whether primary care physicians prioritize the preventive services they discuss with patients and the factors influencing their priorities, especially visit length, patient risk factors, and potential to improve life expectancy.

### The effect of Medicare's annual wellness visit on preventive care for the elderly [^e47964ee]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study aim was to assess the effect of receiving an Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) between 2011 and 2013 on the annual rate of eight preventive services recommended for the Medicare population following the AWV. We used retrospective Medicare claims from 2009 to 2014 for a 5% national sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries in the United States. Propensity score-adjusted logistic regressions were performed to estimate the log odds of the probability of receiving the preventive services between beneficiaries who received AWVs during 2011–13 and those who did not during the same period. The average marginal effect was also reported. Among 845,318 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23% had an AWV in 2011–2013. In a propensity-matched sample of 381,934 patients, AWV participants are more likely to undergo subsequent preventive services within a year (adjusted odds ratio ranges from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.44, 1.49) to 2.43 (95% CI, 2.38, 2.49). The findings are consistent using secondary outcomes or with subgroups defined by baseline primary care provider visits or baseline preventive services. These analyses showed that AWV is associated with a significant increase in all the preventive services examined. As Healthy People 2020 has established a target goal to increase the proportion of older adults who receive a core set of clinical preventive services by 10%, AWV represents a promising opportunity to facilitate the delivery of preventive care for the elderly and to advance our knowledge about effective strategies for healthy aging.

### Principles of screening [^cba7419b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially-oriented procedures for progressively analyzing risk. Screening is broadly based and aimed at identifying those at high risk of a disease or condition. Diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively answer the question of whether or not a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) are necessary for proper utilization of screening tests.

### Protecting children from sexual abuse by health care professionals and in the health care setting [^cb12f7f4]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Normal pediatric examination practice — pediatricians are responsible for assessing the physical health and development of children, including genital health and pubertal development, and during physical examinations it is often appropriate and necessary to perform an examination of sensitive areas of the child. A child's anogenital region is routinely recognized as sensitive, other regions such as the breasts may also be recognized as sensitive, and perceptions of sensitivity vary by individual child and cultural norms. In addition to the physical examination, the pediatrician's and health care professional's (HCP's) history taking and verbal interaction can involve sensitive topics, and sensitive examinations should only be conducted in formal clinical settings. Bright Futures provides guidance on age-appropriate examinations during well-child care, including recommendations for anogenital examinations throughout childhood, and performing routine examinations during preventive annual visits destigmatizes the examination of this organ system.

### Sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound [^b6bb9477]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To show how the evaluation for endometriosis can be included in the routine pelvic ultrasound examination.

Design

Stepwise narrated video demonstration of the sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound following the recommended sonographic approach published in the 2016 consensus paper by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group [1].

Setting

Endometriosis is a common and often debilitating gynecological disorder that affects 5–10% of women [2]. The prevalence is even higher among women with symptoms of endometriosis [2], which include chronic pelvic pain, acquired dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menorrhagia, abnormal bleeding, and infertility. Approximately 80% of women who have endometriosis have superficial lesions, whereas 20% have deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE; [3]). Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, because it allows the diagnosis of all forms of endometriosis and often immediate removal of superficial endometriosis. The removal of DIE is considerably more complicated and usually cannot be completed unless it was diagnosed preoperatively. The technique to diagnose DIE with transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was first described in detail in 2009 [4]. Since then, the accuracy of TVUS for the prediction of DIE has been well established in the literature [5–7]. TVUS is widely used as a first-line investigation for women with gynecological symptoms. The inclusion of an assessment for endometriosis in the routine pelvic ultrasound allows earlier diagnosis and better surgical outcomes for all women with DIE.

Interventions

The evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound based on the IDEA consensus promotes a 4-step dynamic ultrasound approach [1]: (1) routine evaluation of uterus and adnexa with particular attention for sonographic signs of adenomyosis and the presence or absence of endometriomas; (2) evaluation of transvaginal sonographic 'soft markers' such as site-specific tenderness and ovarian mobility; (3) assessment of status of pouch of Douglas using the real-time ultrasound-based "sliding sign"; and (4) assessment of DIE nodules in the anterior and posterior compartments, which involves assessment of the bladder, vaginal vault, uterosacral ligaments, and bowel, including rectum, rectosigmoid junction, and sigmoid colon. Because 5–10% of women with DIE also have ureteric endometriosis, it is useful to assess the kidneys. Silent hydronephrosis is easily identified in 50–60% of patients with ureteric involvement. Although it is possible to identify DIE involving the ureters more directly, this requires more advanced skills, and further studies are still needed to better define the accuracy of ureteric DIE detection by TVUS [8–10].

Conclusion

Traditionally, only pathologies of the uterus and ovaries are assessed during a routine pelvic ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that the routine ultrasound examination can easily be extended beyond the uterus and ovaries into the posterior and anterior pelvic compartments to evaluate structural mobility and to look for deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules, wherewith women suffering from DIE can benefit from a preoperative diagnosis and subsequently, a single, well-planned procedure in the hands of a well-prepared team.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^ce35d602]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — general examination approach specifies core components and associated comorbidity assessment. A routine examination of the head and neck, including careful otoscopy, is the focus of such an examination, and a focused neurologic examination should exclude motor and/or sensory deficits as well as cranial nerve issues that may accompany central nervous system lesions. When pulsatile tinnitus is reported, the examination should focus on identification of cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions, and a full head and neck examination, a general cardiovascular examination, and auscultation/palpation of the head and neck, the skull and mastoid prominences, and orbits should be part of this evaluation. The examination may find treatable otologic conditions that cause tinnitus; cerumen impaction or other ear canal obstructions are diagnosed with otoscopy. Tinnitus can occur in patients with middle ear disease, with or without resultant conductive hearing loss, such as that caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, or otosclerosis, and disorders of the cochlear or vestibular apparatus, such as Ménière's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) and superior canal dehiscence, can cause tinnitus. Vestibular schwannoma can cause tinnitus as well, and tinnitus can occur with medical conditions not directly associated with the ear, including vascular tumors, palatal/middle ear myoclonus, intracranial hypertension, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Emotional distress and/or disturbance of sleep are often associated with severe tinnitus, and the initial history and physical examination should also include assessment of possible associated emotional disturbance or psychiatric illness, which is crucial for patients who may be severely depressed.

### Adolescents and young adults: the pediatrician's role in HIV testing and pre-and postexposure HIV prophylaxis [^dca9e548]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent preventive care — counseling and opportunities for HIV/STI discussion are highlighted: The USPSTF and the AAP recognize that all youth are at current or future risk of STIs and HIV infection, and both organizations recommend that all youth receive behavioral counseling to prevent STIs, including the recommendation that they delay sexual activity. Opportunities to discuss HIV and STIs with youth during routine annual well health assessments are often missed, and the administration of vaccines in adolescent and youth populations provides an additional opportunity for health promotion and preventive counseling including STI and HIV prevention. School physicals and annual athletic preparticipation physical examinations provide other opportunities to discuss HIV and STIs, conduct risk assessment, provide health guidance, and offer testing; these examinations are often the only contact youth have with any health care provider and should occur in the context of the medical home during the health supervision appointment by the athlete's primary care provider.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^08920ec1]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### Do pediatricians routinely perform genitourinary examinations during well-child visits? A review from a large tertiary pediatric hospital [^f981d255]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The male genital examination is a common source of discomfort for the patient and medical provider. Performance of male genital examination is imperative; however, as many treatable diagnoses can be made. Undescended testicles (UDTs), hernias, testicular tumors, and urethral abnormalities are all potentially concerning findings which can be discovered on routine examination.

Objective

The objectives of this study are to determine the rate at which general pediatricians perform routine genitourinary (GU) examinations in the pediatric population and to determine the rate at which UDT are diagnosed or documented in the patient's history. The authors hypothesize the rate of pediatric GU examination during routine well-child visits to be in line with the previously reported rates in the adult literature.

Study Design

Nine hundred ninety-six consecutive male well-child visits conducted by general pediatricians at the study institution were reviewed. These visits were evaluated for documentation of a detailed GU examination as well as the presence of UDT from these examinations. In addition, past medical and surgical histories were reviewed to determine if a diagnosis of UDT was noted.

Results

Pediatricians at the study institution documented GU examinations 99.1% of the time during male well-child visits. Only 1.1% of the cohort had a documentation of UDT at any time point. Of the 11 patients with UDT, 6 boys (54.5%) had spontaneous descent with no referral to urology, whereas 5 (45.5%) required orchidopexy.

Discussion

Prior reports suggest 70–75% of routine office visits include a genital examination. None of these reports reviewed the pediatric population, thus making this review novel in this respect. In addition, the results are vastly different from these prior studies as the authors demonstrated over 99% of male well-child examinations included documentation of a thorough genital examination. A limitation of the study is its retrospective nature, which creates a lack of standardization across the data set. In addition, without being physically present in the examination room, one cannot discern whether an examination is simply being documented without actual performance because of the template format of the electronic medical record (EMR). Furthermore, the study was not designed to best evaluate the true rate of UDTs; therefore, the reported rate of 1.1% cannot be accurately associated with a particular age at diagnosis.

Conclusions

Pediatricians do, in fact, document GU examinations on a routine basis. This finding cannot be taken with complete certainty as verification of actual examination performance is impractical. While the data demonstrated a lower than expected rate of UDT, depending upon age at diagnosis, this could indicate that although examinations are being documented, their accuracy may be diminished because of various factors at play in the healthcare system as a whole, including improper exam performance and EMR templates. Follow-up studies are required to verify these potentially changing rates of UDT and to determine if there is discordance between documentation and performance of GU examinations.

### Assessment of the obese patient [^4de9c3ef]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Obesity may be the most significant medical problem that health care providers will face over the coming decades. Physicians must aggressively address this chronic disease, providing both preventive and therapeutic care. Because this topic traditionally has not been taught in medical schools, physicians need to acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be effective obesity care providers. Performing a detailed initial assessment, including an obesity-focused history, physical examination, and selected laboratory and diagnostic tests, is fundamental to the process of care.

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^38581682]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit are described as High, Moderate, and Low, and the USPSTF defines certainty as the likelihood that its assessment of net benefit is correct. High indicates the available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations and these studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, making the conclusion unlikely to be strongly affected by future studies. Moderate indicates the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes but confidence in the estimate is constrained by factors such as limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings across individual studies, limited generalizability to routine primary care practice, and lack of coherence in the chain of evidence, and as more information becomes available the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change enough to alter the conclusion. Low indicates the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes because of limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency across studies, gaps in the chain of evidence, lack of generalizability to routine primary care practice, lack of information on important health outcomes, or that more information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

### The initial reproductive health visit: ACOG committee opinion, number 811 [^fca4cd2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Management and follow-up in the initial reproductive health visit — health care professionals should address physical findings, diagnosis, and potential treatment options at the completion of the physical examination. Once a treatment plan has been mutually decided upon, the adolescent is encouraged to include the parent or guardian in the management plan, and it is critical to assess what information can and cannot be shared with the parent or guardian. At the conclusion of the visit, the patient, parent or guardian, and obstetrician–gynecologist should discuss the findings and recommendations, any remaining concerns can be addressed, and the parent or guardian can be offered guidance on adolescent development. Follow-up should be individualized and determined by the patient's needs, and adolescents may benefit from close follow-up for questions and support regarding adherence to contraception. Some adolescents will be seen on an annual basis because their needs will change with age; others who need problem-solving care may require closer follow-up; discussing future visit expectations is appropriate. Obstetrician–gynecologists have the opportunity to serve as educators of parents and guardians about reproductive health issues, and resources should be provided for both the adolescent patient and the parent or guardian, if possible, at the conclusion of the visit.

Physical activity assessment and counseling in healthcare settings — using simple tools and documenting results — can promote increased activity, with measurable impact from counseling. Physical activity assessment and counseling in the healthcare setting have important complementary roles; ascertaining physical activity patterns during a standard clinical visit is the first step and can be accomplished through several available simple assessment tools, and the results can be recorded in the electronic health record with parameters such as weight and BP. Physical activity counseling by clinicians can result in modest improvements in activity levels, with a number needed to counsel as low as 12 for an individual to achieve recommended physical activity levels.

### U.S. Preventive Services Task Force methods to communicate and disseminate clinical preventive services recommendations [^465dda1e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues evidence-based screening and prevention recommendations, and key to this task is dissemination and implementation of these recommendations. The Task Force has recommendations for more than 84 topics; each USPSTF Recommendation Statement includes a letter grade, a topline summary to guide clinician interpretation in practice, and a summary of gaps in evidence to help catalyze clinically relevant research. The USPSTF aims to update existing topics regularly and considers new topics to add each year. Clearly communicating and disseminating each recommendation is a critical task to ensure maximum benefit from use of the recommendations. The primary USPSTF audience is primary care clinicians. Over time, other audiences have become interested in the USPSTF and these entities have broad and diverse needs, necessitating a range of communication platforms and approaches. This includes engagement with and input from topic experts, primary care and federal partners, and the public to help shape the development of the recommendations. It also includes engagement of partners to disseminate USPSTF recommendations to help ensure that the primary care workforce remains up-to-date on USPSTF recommendations. This paper outlines the approaches used by the USPSTF to both solicit input (e.g., public comment periods), as well as to facilitate dissemination of its recommendations to help improve the health of all Americans (e.g., web-based and mobile application tools, journal publications, and annual reports to Congress).

### General health checks in adults for reducing morbidity and mortality from disease [^12d86b7d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

General health checks are common elements of health care in some countries. They aim to detect disease and risk factors for disease with the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality. Most of the commonly used individual screening tests offered in general health checks have been incompletely studied. Also, screening leads to increased use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, which can be harmful as well as beneficial. It is therefore important to assess whether general health checks do more good than harm. This is the first update of the review published in 2012.

Objectives

To quantify the benefits and harms of general health checks.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers on 31 January 2018. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed papers for eligibility and read reference lists. One review author used citation tracking (Web of Knowledge) and asked trial authors about additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing health checks with no health checks in adults unselected for disease or risk factors. We did not include geriatric trials. We defined health checks as screening for more than one disease or risk factor in more than one organ system.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. We contacted trial authors for additional outcomes or trial details when necessary. When possible, we analysed the results with a random-effects model meta-analysis; otherwise, we did a narrative synthesis.

Main Results

We included 17 trials, 15 of which reported outcome data (251,891 participants). Risk of bias was generally low for our primary outcomes. Health checks have little or no effect on total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.03; 11 trials; 233,298 participants and 21,535 deaths; high-certainty evidence, I² = 0%), or cancer mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; 8 trials; 139,290 participants and 3663 deaths; high-certainty evidence, I² = 33%), and probably have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; 9 trials; 170,227 participants and 6237 deaths; moderate-certainty evidence; I² = 65%). Health checks have little or no effect on fatal and non-fatal ischaemic heart disease (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03; 4 trials; 164,881 persons, 10,325 events; high-certainty evidence; I² = 11%), and probably have little or no effect on fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 1.05 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 3 trials; 107,421 persons, 4543 events; moderate-certainty evidence, I² = 53%).

Authors' Conclusions

General health checks are unlikely to be beneficial.

However, nearly one fourth of persons aged 51–65 years and 30% of those aged 65–75 years reported no recent cervical cancer and CRC screening, respectively, thus some might reach upper age limits for routine screening without adequate prior screening. Although USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for cervical cancer among average-risk women aged > 65 years or for CRC among adults aged 76–85 years, †† screening might be indicated for some adults in these older groups who were not screened adequately when they were in a younger age group for which routine screening was recommended.

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, NHIS data are self-reported and not verified by medical records. Second, the response rate was 61%, and nonresponse bias is possible despite adjustments for nonresponse. Third, although age-adjusted percentages for screening are presented that are consistent with Healthy People 2020 targets overall, percentages for subgroups are not age-adjusted. Fourth, Pap test data for 2003 were excluded because hysterectomy status was unknown. Fifth, screening guidelines and NHIS screening questions have changed over time. Sixth, confidence intervals were wide for some subgroups, indicating estimate imprecision. Finally, diagnostic tests rather than screening tests might have been reported by some respondents, possibly leading to overestimates of screening.

Increased efforts are needed to reach Healthy People 2020 cancer screening targets and reduce disparities. More intensive or focused efforts might be required to overcome persistent barriers among specific population subgroups. Making available all recommended CRC screening options might increase alignment of tests with individual needs and preferences, and facilitate screening completion. Evidence-based interventions can increase screening use. Information about recommended interventions is available for communities and health systems from The Community Guide. §§ Cancer Control PLANET provides resources for designing and implementing evidence-based programs. Such resources can help communities identify and implement effective interventions appropriate for their needs to increase use of these important services.

What is already known on this topic?

Screening is effective for detecting breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers early when the cancers can be more easily treated and deaths averted. Healthy People 2020 established targets for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States. Disparities in screening use related to several demographic and health care access factors have been observed.

### Counseling to prevent skin cancer: recommendations and rationale of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^8ad2d07d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on counseling to prevent skin cancer and the supporting scientific evidence, and updates the 1996 recommendation contained in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, Second Edition (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Screening for skin cancer. In: Guide to clinical preventive services, 2nd ed. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996:141–52). The USPSTF finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine counseling by primary care clinicians to prevent skin cancer. Although counseling parents may increase children's use of sunscreen, the USPSTF found little evidence to determine the effects of counseling on the sun protection behaviors of adults. These behaviors include wearing protective clothing, reducing excessive sun exposure, avoiding sun lamps and tanning beds, or practicing skin self-examination. The USPSTF, an independent panel of private sector experts in primary care and prevention, systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness of a wide range of clinical preventive services, including screening tests, counseling, and chemoprevention. Members of the USPSTF represent the fields of family medicine, gerontology, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, nursing, and prevention research.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^582898e6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Well-woman visit in interpregnancy care — the periodic well-woman visit as a component of interpregnancy care provides the opportunity for women to receive necessary preventive services and may include multiple well-woman visits for women who have an interpregnancy interval that lasts for more than 1 year; guidance for the components of the well-woman examination can be found in ACOG's Committee Opinion on Well-Woman Visit.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^e6daa052]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Initial evaluation of possible female sexual dysfunction — the initial evaluation may require an extended visit and should include a comprehensive history and physical examination to evaluate possible gynecologic etiologies; laboratory testing typically is not necessary in the initial evaluation of female sexual dysfunction unless an undiagnosed medical etiology is suspected.

### Cancer screening test use-United States, 2013 [^7d6547c8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

The most recent data on screening use (from 2013) show no progress toward meeting Healthy People 2020 targets for cancer screening. Mammography use in women aged 50–74 years was 72.6% (target 81.1%), Pap test use in women aged 21–65 years was 80.7% (target 93.0%), and CRC screening in persons aged 50–75 years was 58.2% (target 70.5%). Compared with 2000, mammography use was unchanged, Pap test use was lower and CRC screening was higher, although unchanged since 2010. Persons without a usual source of care or insurance generally were furthest below Healthy People 2020 targets.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Progress toward Healthy People 2020 targets requires efforts to increase breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening use overall. Evidence-based interventions, such as client and provider reminders and others, can increase screening use.
