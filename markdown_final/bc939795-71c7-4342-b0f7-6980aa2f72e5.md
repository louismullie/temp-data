## Question

For a patient with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3a, which is the preferred therapy: Zocor or atorvastatin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statin — simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin — is preferred for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD stage 3a, and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline direction for lipid management in diabetes with CKD. Then, I should verify whether any guideline explicitly prefers one statin over another in this setting. Next, I need to check pharmacologic and drug–drug interaction considerations in CKD. After that, I will review comparative efficacy and outcomes data, including head-to-head lipid lowering, cardiovascular outcomes, and renal outcomes. Finally, I should synthesize the dosing approach and monitoring plan and state when simvastatin might still be reasonable, before concluding with a succinct recommendation backed by evidence [^1163iZ99] [^111HDmj7] [^116ABzL7].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. In type 2 diabetes with CKD stage 3a (eGFR 45–59), cardiovascular risk is high, and contemporary guidelines prioritize statin therapy and intensive LDL-C lowering to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, with typical LDL-C goals in this risk tier approximating ≤ 1.8 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL) or at least a 50% reduction from baseline in many pathways, particularly when CKD and diabetes co-exist [^1163iZ99] [^115u3p1M]. Hold on, I should verify that CKD populations not on dialysis consistently benefit from statins; the updated Cochrane review confirms reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality with statins in non–dialysis-dependent CKD, which fits this patient's profile [^112hduQM].

> Next, I should review whether any guideline directly addresses which statin to start here. The ABCD‑UKKA 2024 DKD lipid guideline explicitly recommends atorvastatin 20 mg as the first-line statin in people with diabetes, citing simvastatin's higher propensity for side effects and drug–drug interactions, and suggests careful upward titration, particularly as eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116ABzL7]. Wait, let me verify if ESC diabetes guidance specifies an agent; ESC 2023 emphasizes intensive LDL-C lowering with statins but does not name a specific statin, making the ABCD‑UKKA statement the clearest agent-level recommendation for this scenario [^1163iZ99] [^116ABzL7].

> I will now examine pharmacologic and interaction issues that matter in CKD and polypharmacy. Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4 and carries clinically important interactions with common antihypertensives like diltiazem and amlodipine, which are frequently co‑prescribed in diabetes and CKD and amplify myopathy risk; the ABCD‑UKKA guideline highlights this explicitly as a reason to favor atorvastatin first line in DKD [^116ABzL7]. Let me think about atorvastatin's profile; although also metabolized by CYP3A4, it is less encumbered by those specific label‑restricted interactions, offering a safer practical choice amid typical CKD polypharmacy, which strengthens its first‑line positioning in this population [^116ABzL7].

> Next, I should review comparative LDL-C efficacy because potency affects the ability to achieve ≥ 50% reductions and tight LDL targets. In head‑to‑head data in type 2 diabetes, atorvastatin 10 mg reduces LDL-C by about 37% compared with about 26% for simvastatin 10 mg, indicating greater potency per milligram and facilitating target attainment with fewer interaction constraints and dose changes [^115jyfeb]. I need to ensure this potency differential is clinically meaningful; given the need for high‑intensity lowering in diabetes with CKD, the mg‑for‑mg advantage of atorvastatin supports starting at 20 mg with room to titrate to 40–80 mg as needed to reach targets [^1163iZ99] [^115u3p1M].

> Now, let me consider kidney outcomes, but I should be cautious not to overstate. Post hoc pooled analyses of large atorvastatin trials suggest a dose‑dependent favorable effect on kidney function slopes, with greater eGFR preservation at 80 mg versus 10 mg and an association between better kidney function trajectories and fewer cardiovascular events, implying potential reno‑cardiovascular linkage benefits with higher‑intensity atorvastatin dosing in appropriate patients [^1122Jcua] [^1157hV7d]. Wait, I should double‑check the broader evidence base; systematic reviews in DKD show that while statins may reduce albuminuria, effects on overt proteinuria and eGFR decline are not consistently significant, so any renoprotective signal should be interpreted as modest and secondary to the primary cardiovascular benefit rather than a standalone renal indication [^115B9znb] [^111dWVpb]. Let me reconsider the bottom line here: atorvastatin may have favorable renal slope signals in post hoc analyses, but guidelines still center the decision on cardiovascular risk reduction in CKD rather than kidney endpoints per se [^112hduQM] [^111dWVpb].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular outcomes within CKD. Multiple meta-analyses and guidelines confirm that statins reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in non‑dialysis CKD, aligning with intensive LDL-C strategies in diabetes plus CKD, whereas benefits are attenuated or absent in dialysis populations, underscoring the importance of initiating therapy before advanced CKD progression [^112hduQM] [^111dWVpb]. But wait, what about simvastatin‑based evidence in CKD specifically; the SHARP trial demonstrated that simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg reduces major atherosclerotic events in advanced CKD, but that regimen is combination therapy and does not negate atorvastatin's first‑line status for monotherapy in DKD with stage 3 CKD [^113D4DDP].

> I need to translate this to dosing and safety in CKD stage 3a. A practical, guideline‑concordant approach is to start atorvastatin 20 mg daily and titrate to 40–80 mg to achieve LDL-C ≤ 1.8 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL) and/or ≥ 50% reduction, monitoring for muscle symptoms and liver enzymes, with particular vigilance when adding agents that share CYP3A4 pathways or that may raise statin exposure [^116ABzL7] [^115u3p1M]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought simvastatin might be contraindicated at eGFR < 30, but I should correct that; it is not categorically contraindicated in reduced eGFR, rather it is de‑emphasized due to higher interaction burden and myopathy risk, and if used, lower dosing and meticulous interaction screening are required, especially with amlodipine or diltiazem where labeled dose limits apply [^116ABzL7].

> Hold on, I should verify when simvastatin might still be considered. If atorvastatin is not tolerated or unavailable, simvastatin can be used at conservative doses with careful review of concomitant medications and consideration of adding ezetimibe to achieve targets, recognizing that ezetimibe is safe across CKD stages and is guideline‑endorsed as adjunct therapy or for statin intolerance in DKD [^116ABzL7] [^113D4DDP]. Let me also consider alternatives for patients who remain above target despite maximally tolerated statins; agents like PCSK9 inhibitors have consistent LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular benefit across CKD subgroups down to stage 3, which can be leveraged when goals are unmet, though these are typically second‑line in this context [^115N7LgC] [^1153BZqK].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize the clinical decision. Given explicit guideline preference, fewer clinically problematic interactions in CKD polypharmacy, greater LDL-C‑lowering potency per milligram, and supportive outcome data in diabetes and CKD, atorvastatin is the preferred first‑line statin over simvastatin (Zocor) for a patient with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3a requiring intensive LDL-C reduction, with a reasonable start at 20 mg daily and titration to achieve LDL-C ≤ 1.8 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL) and/or ≥ 50% reduction, while monitoring for adverse effects and interactions [^116ABzL7] [^115jyfeb] [^1163iZ99] [^115u3p1M]. I should confirm once more that simvastatin's role is limited by interaction and myopathy concerns; if used at all, it should be at low doses with stringent interaction checks, and combination with ezetimibe can be considered to reach targets when atorvastatin is not an option [^116ABzL7] [^113D4DDP].

> Final recommendation: Prefer atorvastatin over simvastatin in T2DM with CKD stage 3a; initiate atorvastatin 20 mg daily, titrate toward 40–80 mg to achieve LDL-C goals, and monitor liver enzymes and muscle symptoms, while avoiding interacting co‑medications when possible; reserve simvastatin for intolerance or access issues, at cautious doses with thorough interaction screening, and consider ezetimibe add‑on if goals are not reached [^116ABzL7] [^1163iZ99] [^115u3p1M] [^113D4DDP].

Atorvastatin is preferred over simvastatin for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3a [^115N7LgC] because it achieves greater LDL-C lowering [^115jyfeb], offers stronger cardiovascular risk reduction [^notfound], and is recommended by major guidelines for high-risk CKD patients [^1163iZ99] [^116ABzL7]. Atorvastatin does not require dose adjustment in CKD 3a [^116ABzL7], has fewer drug interactions, and is better tolerated at higher intensities. Simvastatin is less potent [^115jyfeb], has more interactions [^116ABzL7], and is limited to moderate intensity due to myopathy risk. Use atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily and titrate to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; monitor lipids, LFTs, and CK regularly [^113u9ruj].

## Pharmacological differences

| **Parameter** | **Simvastatin (Zocor)** | **Atorvastatin** |
|-|-|-|
| Potency | Moderate | High |
| LDL-C reduction | 30–40% (20–40 mg) | 43–60% (10–40 mg) |
| Half-life | ~2 hours | ~14 hours |
| Metabolism | CYP3A4 | CYP3A4 |
| Dose adjustment in CKD 3a | Not required | Not required |
| Maximum recommended dose | 40 mg (due to myopathy risk) | 80 mg (with caution) |

## Clinical evidence in T2DM with CKD stage 3a

### Cardiovascular outcomes

In terms of cardiovascular outcomes, the **CARDS trial** showed a 37% reduction in major cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM treated with atorvastatin [^115CXk6G], including patients with CKD [^116ThKYu]. Meta-analyses also confirm significant cardiovascular risk reduction in CKD stages 1–3 [^115dKJ4P] [^112hduQM]. The **SHARP study** of simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg showed reduced major atherosclerotic events in CKD [^113D4DDP], but simvastatin alone is less potent [^115jyfeb] and is limited by myopathy risk at higher doses [^116ABzL7].

---

### Renal outcomes

For renal outcomes, **atorvastatin** modestly slows eGFR decline [^1122Jcua] and reduces proteinuria in CKD, including diabetic nephropathy [^111U2YG6]. **Simvastatin** shows limited renal benefit and primarily offers cardiovascular benefit in CKD [^111dWVpb] [^115B9znb].

---

## Safety and tolerability

For safety and tolerability, **atorvastatin** has a lower myopathy risk at higher doses, fewer drug interactions, and requires no dose adjustment in CKD 3a [^116ABzL7]. **Simvastatin** has a higher myopathy risk at ≥ 40 mg, significant CYP3A4 interactions, and is limited to moderate intensity.

---

## Guideline recommendations

- **ESC 2023**: High-intensity statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) [^1163iZ99] for T2DM with CKD to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction.
- **KDIGO 2022**: Statin or statin/ezetimibe [^111HDmj7] for CKD stages 1–4, especially with diabetes [^1179Lk3M].
- **ABCD-UKKA 2024**: Atorvastatin 20 mg first-line in T2DM with CKD, titrate to LDL-C targets [^116ABzL7].

---

## Practical considerations

Drug interactions: Atorvastatin has fewer interactions than simvastatin [^116ABzL7], which interacts with **CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem). Patient adherence: Atorvastatin's **once-daily dosing** and **lower side-effect burden** may improve adherence.

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring

Start **atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily** and titrate to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction [^113AZMTp]. Monitoring includes **lipid panel, LFTs, and CK** at baseline and periodically; monitor renal function and electrolytes per CKD care [^113u9ruj].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Atorvastatin is the **preferred statin** for T2DM with CKD stage 3a because it provides greater LDL-C lowering [^115jyfeb], stronger cardiovascular risk reduction [^115CXk6G], and better tolerability at higher intensities [^116ABzL7]. Simvastatin is less potent [^115jyfeb], has more interactions, and is limited by myopathy risk [^116ABzL7]. Use **atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily**, titrating to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction [^113SCkQV]; monitor lipids, LFTs, and CK regularly [^113u9ruj].

Lipid management

Four studies in patients with varying degrees of CKD severity confirmed the safety of intensive LDL-C lowering with statins alone (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin) or with statin in combination with ezetimibe (simvastatin). These studies demonstrated a reduction of serious atherosclerotic events but did not show a significant effect on the progression of CKD. In contrast, in patients on haemodialysis, neither the 'German Diabetes Dialysis Study' (4D study) nor the 'A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Haemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events' (AURORA study) found a significant reduction in three-point MACE with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, respectively, compared with placebo.

For PCSK9 inhibitors, subgroup analyses from the FOURIER study of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab showed that the LDL-C-lowering effect is maintained in patients with CKD stage G3 and that cardiovascular benefits are independent of baseline eGFR.

The ESC guidelines recommend LDL-C targets of < 70 mg/dL for CKD stage G3 and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL for CKD stages G4/5 without dialysis, in combination with at least a 50% reduction in baseline LDL-C. Initiation of statin therapy is not recommended in patients requiring dialysis but should be continued if previously prescribed. Kidney transplant recipients should also receive statin therapy, noting interactions with medications such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. possible interactions between rosuvastatin and tacrolimus, fluvastatin and ciclosporin), although this is only supported by limited study results.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the Joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^116ABzL7]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and are the lipid-modifying agent of choice for people with diabetes. Simvastatin is associated with several side effects and drug interactions with other agents, such as diltiazem and amlodipine. Thus, atorvastatin 20 mg is suggested as the first-line lipid-lowering agent. Dose titration up to a maximum dose of 80 mg should be done with care, especially at lower eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

Rosuvastatin is a high-intensity statin. In CKD stage 1–2, there is no dose adjustment required. In CKD stage 3 or below, the starting dose is 5 mg. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that the maximum dose below eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² is 10 mg. However, European and SPC guidance advises avoiding rosuvastatin at eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

- **Statin intolerance**: Where statin intolerance is an issue, consider switching to an alternate statin, reducing the dose, or employing alternate day dosage.

Ezetimibe blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and upregulates hepatic LDL receptor expression, enabling the reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins. The main role of ezetimibe in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is as an adjunctive to statin use, or in cases of statin intolerance. Ezetimibe can be used in mild to severe kidney disease and co-administered with any dose of statin.

### A controlled, prospective study of the effects of atorvastatin on proteinuria and progression of kidney disease [^111U2YG6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney diseases, particularly when presenting with significant proteinuria, are commonly associated with substantial alterations in serum lipid levels. Experimental evidence suggests that lipid abnormalities may contribute to the progression of kidney disease; however, studies in humans on this subject are scarce.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, controlled open-label study, the authors evaluated the effects of one-year treatment with atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, versus no treatment on proteinuria and progression of kidney disease in 56 patients with chronic kidney disease. Before randomization, all patients had already been treated for one year with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) and other antihypertensive drugs.

- **Results**: By the end of one-year treatment, urine protein excretion decreased from 2.2 ± 0.1 to 1.2 ± 1.0 g every 24 hours (P < 0.01) in patients treated with atorvastatin in addition to ACE inhibitors and ARBs. By contrast, urinary protein excretion decreased only from 2.0 ± 0.1 to 1.8 ± 0.1 g every 24 hours (P value not significant) in patients who did not receive atorvastatin in addition to ACE inhibitors or ARBs. During this time, creatinine clearance decreased only slightly and not significantly (from 51 ± 1.8 to 49.8 ± 1.7 mL/min) in patients treated with atorvastatin. By contrast, during the same period of observation, creatinine clearance decreased from 50 ± 1.9 to 44.2 ± 1.6 mL/min (P < 0.01) in patients who did not receive atorvastatin.

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies in patients with chronic kidney disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: 2-year results from getting to an improved understanding of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and dyslipidemia management (GOULD) [^113AZMTp]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Both the 2013 KDIGO and 2018 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines recommend at least statin therapy for non‐dialysis dependent CKD patients with ASCVD, given that CKD is a major risk factor for the progression of ASCVD, particularly with worsening CKD. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of high‐intensity statins with the addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9i specifically to achieve a cardioprotective LDL‐C goal of < 70 mg/dL. Based on these guidelines, all patients with CKD in our study should be receiving statin therapy, ideally of high intensity, and many should also be on ezetimibe and/or PCSK9i. However, we found that statin use is not ubiquitous, and rates of high‐intensity statin and ezetimibe use remain low in this patient population.

Multiple studies from before the release of these guidelines demonstrate that rates of statin use are low among the CKD population. Examination of statin use in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants with CKD between 1999 and 2014 revealed that utilization of statins in patients with CKD and ASCVD was higher than in those with ASCVD alone, but overall statin use in the CKD population remained low. Data from the NHANES participants showed that statin use increased from 17.6% to 35.7% among 7153 American adults with CKD between 1999–2002 and 2011–2014. After multivariate adjustment, CKD status was not associated with statin use (prevalence ratio, 1.01; 95% CI [0.96–1.08]). The German Chronic Kidney Disease study enrolled 5217 adult patients with moderately severe CKD in Germany shortly before the publi.

### The effect of statins on renal outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B9znb]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The effects of statins on renal outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease were conflicting. The aim of the study was to investigate whether statins treatment could affect renal outcomes, specifically albuminuria or proteinuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), for diabetic kidney disease patients. A comprehensive search was conducted using databases including PubMed, OVID (incorporating MEDLINE and EMBASE), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of statins in diabetic kidney disease patients were selected.

- **Primary outcomes**: The primary outcomes were changes in albuminuria (or proteinuria), with secondary outcomes including levels of eGFR. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted information from the enrolled trials. Eleven randomized controlled trials, encompassing a total of 543 diabetic kidney disease participants, were included in our study.

- **Results**: The overall estimates showed that statins statistically reduced albuminuria (standardized mean differences -0.71, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.23, P = 0.004), despite marked heterogeneity among studies. However, the analysis results indicated that statins could not significantly reduce overt proteinuria (standardized mean differences -0.14, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.26, P = 0.49) or slow the rate of reduction in eGFR (standardized mean differences 0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.26, P = 0.53).

In general, our study demonstrated that statins might have beneficial effects in reducing albuminuria in patients with diabetic kidney disease. However, there was no strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of this intervention on overt proteinuria or eGFR outcomes in these patients.

### Comparative efficacy study of atorvastatin vs simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolaemia [^115jyfeb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Although there is little information from primary or secondary prevention trials on cholesterol-lowering medication in diabetic patients, the reduction of elevated cholesterol is widely recommended for this group. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends drug therapy in diabetic patients if low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains at > 130 mg/dL, or > 100 mg/dL in patients with macroangiopathy, after dietary intervention. When cholesterol-lowering medication is indicated, the choice of the drug must take into account the other lipid abnormalities that are often present and the need to maintain optimal glycaemic control.

In the present study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day with simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin at doses of 10, 20, and 20 mg/day, respectively, and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients with moderate elevation of LDL cholesterol with or without elevation of triglycerides. All the quoted agents are enzyme inhibitors effective in lowering LDL cholesterol in humans. The efficacy endpoints were the mean percent changes in plasma LDL cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment (24 weeks). Atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day produced:

- A significant reduction in LDL cholesterol (-37%) in comparison with equivalent doses of:
	- Simvastatin (-26%)
	- Pravastatin (-23%)
	- Lovastatin (-21%)
	- Placebo (-1%)
- HDL cholesterol increases (7.4%) comparable to.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^1122Jcua]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Kidney function decreases during a person's lifetime, and this decline is a powerful predictor of both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Statins lower cardiovascular risk, which may be related to beneficial effects on kidney function. We studied whether atorvastatin influences kidney function decline and assessed the association between individual kidney function slopes and cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: Data were collected from 6 large atorvastatin cardiovascular outcome trials conducted in patients not selected for having kidney disease. Slopes of serum creatinine reciprocals representing measures of kidney function change ([mg/dL]⁻¹/year) were analyzed in 30,621 patients. Based on treatment arms, patients were categorized into three groups: placebo (n = 10,057), atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 12,763), and 80 mg daily (n = 7,801). To assess slopes, mixed-model analyses were performed for each treatment separately, including time in years and adjustment for study. These slopes displayed linear improvement over time in all three groups. Slope estimates for patients randomized to placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and 80 mg were 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/year, respectively.

A head-to-head comparison of atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg based on data from one study (TNT [Treating to New Targets]; n = 10,001) showed a statistically significant difference in slope between the two doses (P = 0.0009). From a Cox proportional hazards model using slope as a predictor, there was a significant (P < 0.0001) negative association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^1179Lk3M]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). High credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline for the management of dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) was published in 2003. Since then, considerable evidence, including randomized controlled trials of statin therapy in adults with CKD, has better defined medical treatments for dyslipidemia. In light of the new evidence, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) formed a work group for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD. This work group developed a new guideline that contains substantial changes from the prior KDOQI guideline.

KDIGO recommends the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD primarily based on the risk for coronary heart disease, which is largely driven by age. The KDIGO guideline does not recommend using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as a guide for identifying individuals with CKD to be treated or as treatment targets. Initiation of statin treatment is no longer recommended in dialysis patients.

To assist US practitioners in interpreting and applying the KDIGO guideline, NKF-KDOQI convened a work group to write a commentary on this guideline. For the most part, our work group agreed with the recommendations of the KDIGO guideline. However, we describe several areas in which we believe the guideline statements are either too strong or need to be more nuanced, areas of uncertainty and inconsistency, as well as additional research recommendations. The target audience for the KDIGO guideline includes nephrologists, primary care practitioners, and non-nephrology specialists.

### Effects of atorvastatin on kidney outcomes and cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes: An analysis from the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) [^116ThKYu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). High credibility.

We examined whether atorvastatin affects diabetic kidney disease and whether the effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) varies by kidney status in patients with diabetes.

- **Study design**: The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) was a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting & participants**: Patients with type 2 diabetes and no prior CVD were included in the study (n = 2,838).

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly allocated to receive atorvastatin, 10 mg daily, or a placebo, with a median follow-up of 3.9 years.

- **Outcomes**: The study measured estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CVD.

- **Measurements**: Baseline and follow-up GFRs were estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. The urinary albumin-creatinine ratio was measured on spot urine samples.

- **Results**: At baseline, 34% of patients had an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a modest improvement in annual change in eGFR (net improvement, 0.18 mL/min/1.73 m² per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.32; P = 0.01), which was most apparent in those with albuminuria (net improvement, 0.38 mL/min/1.73 m² per year; P = 0.03). At baseline, 21.5% of patients had albuminuria, and an additional 6.8% developed albuminuria during follow-up. Atorvastatin did not influence the incidence of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.73 to 3.04; P = 0.3) or regression to normoalbuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.57 to 2.49; P = 0.6). In 970 patients with a moderately decreased eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m², there was a 42% reduction in major CVD events with treatment, including a 61% reduction.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the Joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^113u9ruj]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

This guideline is based on the opinion of the ABCD and UKKA working group and is an update of previous 2021 and 2017 guidance. This 2024 update is based on searches conducted between January 2020 and March 2023. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and hand-searched reference lists and articles identified by ABCD-UKKA writing group members.

Search terms used were 'diabetes', 'lipids', and 'chronic kidney disease/nephropathy'. We also reviewed all related guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), UKKA, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), the European Renal Association Best Practice Guidelines, and the American and European Diabetes Associations.

The recommendation grades range from 1 (strong recommendation) to 2 (weak recommendation), and the corresponding evidence quality is categorized as A (high-quality evidence), B (moderate-quality evidence), C (low-quality evidence), and D (very low-quality evidence).

Standard lipid abbreviations are used: total cholesterol (TC), chylomicron (CM), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), and triglycerides (TG).

- **Recommendations for lipid measurement and frequency of monitoring**: There is clear evidence relating LDL cholesterol levels to atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk and evidence regarding reducing LDL cholesterol levels and reducing ASCVD risk. There is also a relative risk attributable to non-HDL cholesterol (calculated as TC minus HDL cholesterol). A meta-analysis suggests a significant association between lipid levels and ASCVD outcomes.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^112hduQM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people with coronary artery disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014, which included 50 studies (45,285 participants).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of statins compared with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or another statin in adults with CKD not requiring dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to October 4, 2023. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. An updated search will be undertaken every three months.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of statins with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or other statins, on death, cardiovascular events, kidney function, toxicity, and lipid levels in adults with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two or more authors independently extracted data and assessed the study risk of bias. Treatment effects were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous benefits and harms with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the Joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^114awWMB]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Until relatively recently, type 2 diabetes has been considered a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equivalent. It is now clear that diabetes per se is not a CVD risk equivalent. Rather, certain characteristics are required to escalate CVD risk, most notably a longer duration of diabetes and/or the presence of albuminuria. In addition, chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), also enhances CVD risk. Thus, the combination of type 2 diabetes with albuminuria, stage G3 CKD, or higher substantially increases the risk of CVD.

There have been several large-scale prospective CVD outcome studies involving people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database, established in 1994, includes individual participant data from statin trials with at least 1,000 participants and ≥ 2 years of follow-up. In the 2008 CTT meta-analysis of outcomes in over 18,000 people with diabetes from 14 randomized trials of statin therapy, a 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol reduced the combined endpoint of coronary heart disease (CHD) death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 22%, CVD events by 21%, vascular death by 13%, and all-cause death by 9%. Coronary revascularization was reduced by 25% and stroke by 21%.

A further CTT meta-analysis (2016) of data from 28 trials (n = 183,419; 35,781 with diabetes) confirmed that statins reduce the risk of a first major vascular event by 21% per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. The CTT looked at risk ratios in sub-divisions of participants stratified by eGFR (≥ 60, 45– < 60, 30– < 45, < 30, and dialysis).

### Lipid-lowering therapy in persons with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dWVpb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapy is not widely used in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite a high burden of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease in this population.

- **Purpose**: To synthesize evidence examining the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on clinical outcomes in persons with CKD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 2000 through November 2011.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lipid-lowering therapy with control treatment in persons with CKD, including subgroup analyses of trials in the general population.

- **Data extraction**: Abstracts were screened and data were extracted on study methodology, population, interventions, cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and adverse events. Data were extracted by one author and confirmed by another. Study quality was determined by consensus. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed.

- **Data synthesis**: Eighteen RCTs, all in adults, met the eligibility criteria. Five RCTs involved CKD populations, and 13 were CKD subgroup analyses from trials in the general population. Sixteen RCTs examined statins, and two examined statins plus ezetimibe. Lipid-lowering therapy does not improve kidney outcomes but decreases the risk for cardiac mortality (pooled risk ratio [RR] from six trials, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91]; P < 0.001), cardiovascular events (including revascularization) (pooled RR from nine trials, 0.78 [CI, 0.71 to 0.86]; P < 0.001), and myocardial infarction (pooled RR from nine trials, 0.74 [CI, 0.71 to 0.97]; P < 0.001).

### The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin plus ezetimibe in patients with chronic kidney disease (study of heart and renal protection): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^113D4DDP]. Lancet (2011). High credibility.

The SHARP study, published by Baigent C and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Lancet, addresses chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dyslipidemia. The central question of the study was the role of simvastatin plus ezetimibe in patients with advanced CKD. This was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 9,270 patients, composed of 3,470 females and 5,800 males. Inclusion criteria were patients with advanced CKD. Key exclusion criteria included a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, chronic liver disease, active inflammatory muscle disease, previous adverse reactions to statins or ezetimibe, concurrent treatment with a contraindicated drug, or child-bearing potential.

- **Interventions**
- 4,650 patients received simvastatin plus ezetimibe (20 mg simvastatin and 10 mg ezetimibe daily).
- 4,620 patients received a matching placebo daily.

- **Primary outcomes**: A significant decrease in major atherosclerotic events was observed (11.3% vs. 13.4%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94).

- **Secondary outcomes**
- No significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary artery disease (4.6% vs. 5%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11).
- Significant decrease in non-hemorrhagic stroke (2.8% vs. 3.8%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.94).
- Significant decrease in arterial revascularization procedures (6.1% vs. 7.6%; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences were noted in the excess risk of m.

### Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS): Multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115CXk6G]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the role of lipid-lowering therapy with statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetes is inadequately defined. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of atorvastatin 10 mg daily for primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes without high concentrations of LDL-cholesterol.

- **Methods**: 2838 patients aged 40–75 years in 132 centres in the UK and Ireland were randomised to placebo (n = 1410) or atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 1428). Study entrants had no documented previous history of cardiovascular disease, an LDL-cholesterol concentration of 4.14 mmol/L or lower, a fasting triglyceride amount of 6.78 mmol/L or less, and at least one of the following: retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension. The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of the following: acute coronary heart disease events, coronary revascularisation, or stroke. Analysis was by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: The trial was terminated 2 years earlier than expected because the prespecified early stopping rule for efficacy had been met. The median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (IQR 3.0–4.7). 127 patients allocated placebo (2.46 per 100 person-years at risk) and 83 allocated atorvastatin (1.54 per 100 person-years at risk) had at least one major cardiovascular event (rate reduction 37% [95% CI -52 to -17], p = 0.001). Treatment would be expected to prevent at least 37 major vascular events per 1000 such people treated for 4 years.

### Statins and cardiovascular primary prevention in CKD: A meta-analysis [^115dKJ4P]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple meta-analyses of lipid-lowering therapies for cardiovascular primary prevention in the general population have been performed. Other meta-analyses of lipid-lowering therapies in CKD have also been conducted, but not for primary prevention. This meta-analysis assesses lipid-lowering therapies for cardiovascular primary prevention in CKD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. MEDLINE was searched between January 2012 and September 2013 for new studies using predefined search criteria without language restrictions. A number of other sources, including previously published meta-analyses, were also reviewed. Inclusion criteria were randomized control trials of primary prevention with lipid-lowering therapy in non-end stage CKD.

- **Results**: Six trials were identified, five including patients with stage 3 CKD only. These studies included 8,834 participants and 32,846 person-years of follow-up. All trials were post hoc subgroup analyses of statins in the general population. Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (the prespecified primary outcome) by 41% in stages 1–3 CKD compared with placebo (pooled risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48 to 0.72). For the secondary outcomes, the risk ratios were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.88) for total mortality, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72) for coronary heart disease events, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.13) for stroke. In study participants with stage 3 CKD specifically, the results were similar.

### Simvastatin reduces chronic kidney disease and renal failure risk in type 2 diabetes patients: post hoc ACCORD trial analysis [^112koEwC]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a substantial global health concern. Statins are widely used among T2DM patients for managing dyslipidemia, preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and offering renal protection. However, the extent to which their renal protective effects contribute to reducing the incidence of severe renal complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal failure, is not well defined.

This investigation scrutinizes the impact of simvastatin versus placebo on renal outcomes among T2DM patients utilizing data from the ACCORD trial. It encompasses incidence rate comparisons, Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models, and mediation analyses.

The study consisted of 3,619 individuals diagnosed with T2DM, among which 2,753 were treated routinely with simvastatin, while 866 did not receive any statin therapy. After adjusting for baseline characteristics and time-dependent covariates, simvastatin treatment was associated with a 71% reduction in the risk of CKD (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.27–0.31, p < 0.01) and a 47% reduction in the risk of renal failure (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.44–0.65, p < 0.01) compared to the statin-free group. Further subgroup analysis, accounting for the initial lipid and kidney profiles, indicated variable impacts of simvastatin on CKD and renal failure outcomes. Nevertheless, a consistent reduction in CKD risk was observed across all subgroups within the statin-treated population. Additional mediation analysis revealed that the reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may be a potential mediator in reducing renal outcomes.

### Long-term effects following 4 years of randomized treatment with atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis [^111VHvjK]. Kidney International (2016). High credibility.

The 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse) Study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing 4 years of treatment with atorvastatin to placebo in 1,255 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint of cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) was non-significantly reduced by 8%. However, long-term effects remained uncertain. Therefore, surviving patients were invited to a follow-up survey conducted by questionnaire. Post-trial statin therapy was left to the nephrologist's discretion, and outcomes were centrally adjudicated and analyzed by intention to treat and time to first event in the original treatment groups.

The median overall follow-up was 11.5 years. Post-trial statin use and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not differ between groups. Statin treatment non-significantly affected the former primary outcome (relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.07). The risk of all cardiac events combined and the risk of cardiac death were significantly lower in the original statin group compared to placebo (0.83, 0.70–0.97, and 0.80, 0.66–0.97). No significant effect was detected on cerebrovascular events, fatal stroke, fatal cancer, non-vascular, or all-cause death. No rhabdomyolysis was reported.

Thus, after 4 years of atorvastatin treatment in diabetic hemodialysis patients, similar effects on outcomes were found after 11.5 years of follow-up as were found at the end of the original study. There was no evidence of emerging hazards in the long term, confirming clinical practice guidelines.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^117NoZJS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people who have existing coronary artery disease. This is an update of a review published in 2009, and includes evidence from 27 new studies (25,068 participants) in addition to the 26 studies (20,324 participants) assessed previously; it excludes three previously included studies (107 participants). This updated review includes 50 studies (45,285 participants), of which 38 (37,274 participants) were meta-analyzed.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits (such as reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, and stroke; and slowing progression of CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)) and harms (muscle and liver dysfunction, withdrawal, and cancer) of statins compared with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or another statin in adults with CKD who were not on dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialized Register up to 5 June 2012 through contact with the Trials' Search Coordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of statins with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or other statins, on mortality, cardiovascular events, kidney function, toxicity, and lipid levels in adults with CKD not on dialysis were the focus of our literature searches.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two or more authors independently collected and analyzed data.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes-a tiered approach: An overview of the joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^115u3p1M]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). High credibility.

For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, we suggest the following treatment targets: total cholesterol ≤ 4.0 mmol/L, non‐HDL cholesterol ≤ 2.5 mmol/L, and LDL cholesterol ≤ 1.8 mmol/L. For pragmatic reasons, we have not suggested percentage reductions in baseline levels, nor have we suggested a graded approach to therapy. We are aware that with time pressures and conflicting demands, lipid management is often neglected. Clear targets and a simple stepwise approach to management can help more people access appropriate therapy.

In most cases, atorvastatin 20 mg is suggested as the first-line lipid-lowering agent with dose titration or use of higher intensity statins as required, according to the summary of product characteristics (SPC) and local guidance. Specialist advice should be sought at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In people with statin intolerance, ezetimibe alone or in combination with bempedoic acid can be used. Fibrates cause a reversible increase in creatinine and specialist advice is recommended when these are used in people with CKD.

There are newer agents, inclisiran, PSCK9 inhibitors, and icosapent ethyl, available for people who do not meet treatment targets using statins or ezetimibe. These agents have specific licensing indications, including specific cholesterol ranges, and also local restrictions. For these agents, evidence for benefit exists up to stage G3b CKD.

Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in lowering CVD risk; however, there are specific side effects to be aware of which are listed on the individual summary of product characteristics.

### Is statin-induced diabetes clinically relevant? A comprehensive review of the literature [^113Axsh9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

In individuals predisposed to the development of diabetes, such as those who are insulin resistant, obese, and older, statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Despite this risk being identified through post hoc analyses, it appears to be a class effect with a dose-response relationship. However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated with statins remains uncertain. Although the exact mechanism by which statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is the reduction in adiponectin levels. Higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes; however, for every case of diabetes induced, approximately three cardiovascular events are reduced with high-dose versus moderate-dose statin therapy. Overall, the small risk of developing type 2 diabetes with statin therapy is considerably outweighed by the potential of statins to decrease cardiac events.

### Simvastatin reduces chronic kidney disease and renal failure risk in type 2 diabetes patients: Post hoc ACCORD trial analysis [^115zVwjv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

Our analyses demonstrated that administering simvastatin at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/day, adjusted based on the presence of cardiovascular disease and follow-up LDL-C levels, for an average duration of 4.9 years, significantly reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal failure compared to not using statin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, with a baseline median eGFR of 89.9 ml/min/1.73 m². Furthermore, the analysis revealed significant variability in the treatment effect on CKD and renal failure based on baseline lipid levels, albuminuria, or eGFR levels, yet the risk of CKD consistently decreased across all subgroups. Additionally, LDL-C reduction appears to be a potential mediator of simvastatin's protective effect on CKD.

This study represents a post hoc analysis of the ACCORD Trial. Uniquely, our analysis included a statin-free control group, a rarity in contemporary intervention studies due to the well-documented cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy in diabetes patients. The absence of a placebo control group challenges the reliability and validity of findings. Furthermore, our study benefited from a large sample size and an extensive, nearly complete follow-up period.

Our findings suggest simvastatin's beneficial effects on kidney function, particularly in reducing CKD and renal failure among T2DM patients. This study concentrated on the impact on clinically relevant renal events rather than solely on eGFR decline. Our results align with those from the Heart Protection Study (HPS), which found that simvastatin significantly mitigates CKD risk in T2DM patients.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^1171CoHG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The contribution of chronic kidney disease (CKD) towards the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) is magnified with co-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Lipids are a modifiable risk factor, and good lipid management offers improved outcomes for people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The primary purpose of this guideline, written by the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) and UK Kidney Association (UKKA) working group, is to provide practical recommendations on lipid management for members of the multidisciplinary team involved in the care of adults with DKD.

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies in patients with chronic kidney disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: 2-year results from Getting to an improved understanding of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and dyslipidemia management (GOULD) [^113fj2Zm]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The 2013 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination therapy to reduce ASCVD risk in patients 50 years of age with CKD who are not on dialysis, as well as for those aged 18–49 years with known ASCVD and non‐dialysis dependent CKD. The 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Multispecialty cholesterol guidelines recommend a high‐intensity statin with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9i for high‐risk ASCVD patients with CKD and LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL. While evidence for LDL‐C lowering in the prevention of ASCVD in CKD patients primarily derives from post hoc analyses, subgroup analyses of multiple clinical trials support benefit. A meta‐analysis of 13 studies showed that statins reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events in Stage 3 CKD (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.78) and Stage 4 CKD (pooled HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40–0.96) patients. There was no significant benefit in patients with Stage 5 CKD and those on dialysis, but overall, more patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD need to be included in lipid lowering trials.

The primary objective of the GOULD multicenter observational registry (NCT02993120) is to evaluate changes in the use of evidence‐based lipid‐lowering therapies and, secondarily, trends in LDL‐C levels over time in patients with ASCVD in the United States. Patients were enrolled between 2017 and 2018 and followed prospectively for 2 years. Only 17.1% of all patients with ASCVD had intensification of LLT, and two‐thirds of patients continued to have sustained…

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^111M9EAW]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of summary data from randomised controlled trials have shown that statin therapy increases the risk of diabetes, but less is known about the size or timing of this effect or who is at greatest risk. We aimed to address these gaps in knowledge through analysis of individual participant data from large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participated in the CTT Collaboration. All double-blind randomised controlled trials of statin therapy of at least 2 years' scheduled duration and with at least 1000 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. All recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments, and measures of glycaemia were sought from eligible trials. Meta-analyses assessed the effects of allocation to statin therapy on new-onset diabetes (defined by diabetes-related adverse events, use of new glucose-lowering medications, glucose concentrations, or HbA1c values) and on worsening glycaemia in people with diabetes (defined by complications of glucose control, increased use of glucose-lowering medication, or HbA1c increase of ≥ 0.5%). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on these outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

- **Findings**: Of the trials participating in the CTT Collaboration, 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123,940 participants, 25,701 [21%] with diabetes; median follow-up of 4.3 years), and four trials.

### Association of thiazide diuretics with diabetes progression, kidney disease progression, cardiovascular outcomes, and death among patients with diabetes who initiate statins [^116Vzeuh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Statins have been associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) progression, but their cardiovascular benefits in patients with DM outweigh the harm. However, the effects of using other medications that similarly increase blood glucose levels, such as thiazide diuretics, are not well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the concomitant use of thiazide diuretics and statins on DM progression, cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and death in patients with DM.

This is a retrospective cohort study of Veterans with DM who initiated statins between 2003 and 2015. The cohort comprised thiazide users (who concomitantly used thiazides and statins for ≥ 6 months) and active comparators (who concomitantly used calcium channel blockers [CCB] but not thiazides, along with statins for ≥ 6 months). We excluded patients who were < 18 years old, had chronic kidney disease stage 4 or worse, or used loop diuretics. We propensity-score-matched comparison groups on 99 baseline characteristics, including demographics, healthcare utilization, comorbidities, cardiovascular and comorbidity scores, vital signs, laboratory data, and medication class usage.

Outcomes measured were:

1. DM progression — new insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes, and hyperglycemic episodes.
2. Kidney disease progression — doubling of serum creatinine, incidence of chronic kidney disease stage 5, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and incidence of diabetic nephropathy.
3. Cardiovascular outcomes — acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest.
4. Total mortality.

### Atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis [^114YkPZK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

The 4-D study, published by Wanner C and colleagues in 2005 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine, addresses several diseases including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, diabetic nephropathy, and dyslipidemia. The central question of the study was: What role does atorvastatin play in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis?

The study employed a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and included a population of 1255 patients, comprising 578 females and 677 males. Inclusion criteria were patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis. Key exclusion criteria included hematopoietic disease or systemic disease unrelated to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); vascular intervention, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the three months before enrollment; unsuccessful kidney transplantation; and hypertension resistant to therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- Atorvastatin (20 mg/day) administered to 619 patients
	- Placebo (matching placebo per day) administered to 636 patients

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in death from cardiac causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke at three years (31.9% vs. 30.5%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in fatal stroke (4% vs. 2%; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.93)
	- Significant decrease in all cardiac events combined (33% vs. 39%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99)
	- No significant difference in death (48% vs. 50%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08)

The conclusion of the 4-D study highlights the role of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis.

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during statin treatment with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^1153RZPW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

This study examined several covariates, including demographics (age, sex, and body mass index), usage of medical resources (outpatient visits and number of hospitalizations in the year before the index date), primary disease causing chronic kidney disease (CKD), comorbidities, medications at baseline, and laboratory data at baseline. The body mass index was determined using the most recently available data from the year preceding the index date.

Primary diseases for CKD encompassed polycystic kidney disease, hypertensive nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulonephritis (e.g. immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), as well as obstructive nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, and others. Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and heart failure. Primary disease for CKD and comorbidities were confirmed if reported at more than two outpatient visits or one inpatient stay within the year before the index date.

Baseline laboratory data, such as hemoglobin, glycohemoglobin, proteinuria, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, and alanine aminotransferase, were obtained using the most recent data within three months preceding the index date. To avoid detecting the lipid profile prior to the initiation of statin treatment, the latest data from the first three-month follow-up was used to identify the lipid profile, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. Finally, the usage of antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic drugs, and other medications was identified according to the prescription records.

### The unique character of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease and its implications for treatment with lipid-lowering drugs [^113bqUmu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there are very limited data to guide the use of lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) in this population because the major trials of LLDs in the general population have included very few individuals with CKD. The pathophysiologic and epidemiologic differences of CVD in the CKD population suggest that the study findings derived in the general population may not be directly applicable to those with CKD, and the few trials that have been directed at patients with kidney disease have not shown clear clinical benefits of LLDs.

The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Work Group has provided consensus-based guidelines for managing dyslipidemias in individuals with CKD and after renal transplantation. Since the publication of these statements, further data have emerged and multiple studies are ongoing to better define the role of LLDs in patients with CKD. In this article, the data pertinent to the CKD population are reviewed, and updated recommendations for the use of LLDs in the CKD population are provided.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^112QerBj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Dyslipidaemia occurs frequently in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and contributes both to cardiovascular disease and worsening renal function. Statins are widely used in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients (pre-dialysis) even though evidence favoring their use is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of statins in CKD patients who were not receiving renal replacement therapy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library), and hand-searched reference lists of textbooks, articles, and scientific proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing statins with placebo, no treatment, or other statins in adult pre-dialysis CKD patients.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (lipids, creatinine clearance, and proteinuria) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and withdrawal rates) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Twenty-six studies (25,017 participants) comparing statins with placebo were identified. Total cholesterol decreased significantly with statins (18 studies, 1,677 patients: MD -41.48 mg/dL, 95% CI -49.97 to -33.99). Similarly, LDL cholesterol decreased significantly with statins (16 studies, 1,605 patients: MD -42.38 mg/dL, 95% CI -50.71 to -34.05). Statins decreased both the risk…

### Controversies regarding lipid management and statin use for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with CKD [^114bqeQd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at heightened risk for dying of cardiovascular disease. Results from randomized clinical trials of statin drugs versus placebo demonstrate that statin drugs or statin plus ezetimibe reduce the absolute risk for coronary heart disease and mortality among adults with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2013 clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD recommends that adults 50 years or older with non-dialysis-dependent CKD be treated with a statin or statin plus ezetimibe regardless of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, at least nine guidelines published during the last five years address lipid management for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and not all guidelines address the utility of lipid-lowering therapy in adults with CKD. Because most patients with CKD receive most of their clinical care from non-nephrologists, differences in recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention may negatively affect the clinical care of adults with CKD and cause confusion for both patients and providers. This review addresses the identification and management of lipid levels in patients with CKD and discusses the existing controversies regarding testing and treatment of lipid levels in the CKD population.

### Effect of lipid-lowering drugs on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and dyslipidemia: A retrospective cohort study [^112YLc8r]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

The effects of lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dyslipidemia are not completely understood. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effect of LLDs on end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and mortality in adult patients with CKD stage 3b, 4, or 5, and dyslipidemia. Participants were recruited between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, and classified as LLD or non-LLD users; the final follow-up date was December 31, 2020.

The primary outcome was time to ESKD or death due to renal failure. Sub-distribution hazard regression models adjusted for multivariables, including time-varying lipid profile covariates, were used for the analysis. Among the 6,740 participants, 4,280 patients with CKD and dyslipidemia, including 872 using LLDs and 3,408 not using LLDs, completed the primary analysis. The multivariable analyses showed that LLD users had a significantly lower risk of time to the composite renal outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.76, 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.89), and MACE incidence (aHR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.62–0.93) than did non-LLD users. After adjusting for time-varying covariates of the lipid profile, there was a significant difference in the composite renal outcome (aHR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.65–0.93) and MACEs (aHR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.60–0.98). Among adult patients with advanced CKD and dyslipidemia, LLD users had a significantly lower risk of composite renal outcomes and MACEs than non-LLD users.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^113oGzxF]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2023 ESC guidelines recommend initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, or dapagliflozin). This is advised to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney failure in patients with T2DM and CKD who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m².

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence [^115frQxr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Both in primary prevention and in the very-high-risk patients, it seems that statins reduce major cardiovascular events irrespective (at least in part) of the baseline and post-therapy LDL levels achieved. Should statins be generally prescribed in a fixed-dose manner? We would not go so far as to suggest that, but indeed, in the diabetic individual whose LDL cholesterol is seemingly within normal limits, this should be considered. The indication for statin therapy in diabetic individuals should not rely solely on LDL levels but on the inherent cardiovascular risk that accompanies this disease (even if goal LDL levels are met).

We believe that the standards of care for individuals with diabetes should mirror the evidence. Replacing a fixed-dose statin trial scheme with a treat-to-target LDL guideline is controversial. This inherent problem of the Guidelines should be amended. Evidence based on "hard" outcome trials of statin use should guide our treatment goals and considerations, not epidemiologic or extrapolated LDL-based data.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin [^115fjSi4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetic patients: The vast majority of clinical trials examining cholesterol reduction as a means to reduce cardiovascular risk were performed using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Only three trials recruited diabetic patients exclusively, but some other trials included sufficient diabetic patients to facilitate prespecified or post hoc analyses of the effect of statins in these patients.

### Effect of atorvastatin on kidney function in chronic kidney disease: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1138mgNt]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

The effect of atorvastatin on kidney function was assessed in patients with stages 2–4 chronic kidney disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in chronic kidney disease clinics in Northern Tasmania and enrolled 132 patients with serum creatinine levels > 120 μmol/l, not taking lipid-lowering therapy, and at all levels of proteinuria and serum cholesterol. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of atorvastatin per day (64 patients) or placebo (68 patients) and were followed with trial visits every three months for a mean of 2.5 years. The primary outcome was the rate of MDRD eGFR and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (C-G CrCl) decline. Analysis was based on intention to treat and included all patients who had at least one follow-up visit.

- **Results**: The rate of MDRD eGFR decline was 29% lower in the atorvastatin-treated group compared to the placebo-treated group; 1.04 ± 3.84 vs. 1.47 ± 3.74 ml/min/1.73 m²/yr (P = 0.53). Similarly, the C-G CrCl was 20% lower; 1.88 ± 5.07 vs. 2.36 ± 4.61 ml/min/1.73 m²/yr (P = 0.58). Although blood pressure decreased in both atorvastatin and placebo-treated groups, there were no differences between groups. Additionally, there was no difference in concomitant medication intake, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, between groups.

- **Conclusions**: There was a trend toward a slower eGFR decline in the atorvastatin-treated group that did not reach statistical significance. This may have been due to the lack of power of the study. However, atorvastatin may have a renoprotective effect.

### Simvastatin reduces chronic kidney disease and renal failure risk in type 2 diabetes patients: post hoc ACCORD trial analysis [^11142LgN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

Our subgroup analysis revealed that the protective effect of simvastatin on CKD and renal failure in patients with T2DM varies across different baseline lipid and renal profiles. Existing evidence indicates that diabetes and CKD are often associated with an altered lipid profile, typically characterized by low HDL-C and elevated triglyceride levels. Although in patients with typical diabetic or CKD lipid profiles — low HDL-C and high triglycerides — the protective effect of simvastatin on CKD appeared slightly less pronounced, its effect remained consistently beneficial across all subgroups. This finding supports the use of simvastatin to reduce the risk of CKD in T2DM patients, regardless of their lipid profile or renal function status.

- **Mediator analyses**: Our mediator analyses suggest that LDL-C reduction mediates the protective effect of simvastatin on CKD. Indeed, high LDL-C levels have been both observationally and genetically associated with increased risks of CKD, indicating a potential causal role of LDL-C in the pathogenesis of the disease. The mechanisms behind lipid-induced renal damage are centered on lipotoxicity, where excessive lipid accumulation leads to cellular dysfunction and injury, particularly affecting renal tubular epithelial cells, renal interstitial cells, and glomerular podocytes. This process is closely linked to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, as previously mentioned, not all LDL-C-lowering statins offer renal protection. Our study shows that LDL-C reduction only partially mediates this protective effect, suggesting that simvastatin may have renal benefits beyond LDL-C reduction.

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during statin treatment with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^112dqMT1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In regard to lipid management, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) require special consideration when compared with other high-risk groups. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CKD, with a continual increase in the risk of CVD from the early stages of CKD along with a decline in renal function. However, the association between LDL-C level and cardiovascular outcomes in the CKD population seems to be less apparent, and the role of statin treatment in this population is unclear compared with that in other high-risk populations.

Most notably, in contrast to the more predominant benefit of LDL-C reduction in high–cardiovascular risk populations, the 4D (Deutsche Diabetes Dialysis Study) and AURORA (A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events) trials have unequivocally proven that statin treatment plays no role in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Moreover, subgroup analyses in the SHARP (Study of Heart and Renal Protection) study and recent meta-analyses have revealed a trend of reduced benefit of statins as CKD progressed from stage 3 to stage 5. This trend of a weak association between cardiovascular risks and LDL-C levels or statin treatment during advanced CKD stages is believed to be multifactorial. The factors include changes in cholesterol metabolism, such as low LDL-C production but longer plasma residence time and lower LDL-C levels but a higher ratio of oxidized and small dense LDL particles.

### Statins for hemodialysis patients with diabetes? Long-term follow-up endorses the original conclusions of the 4D Study [^116hZyab]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical benefits of statins in dialysis patients are unproven. New follow-up data from the 4D Study indicate no clear reduction in cardiovascular events among patients with type-2 diabetes. Assessing outcomes 7.4 years beyond the randomization period (20 mg atorvastatin versus placebo), no differences in a composite cardiovascular outcome were observed, and no safety concerns emerged. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines do not need updating based on these new data.

### Effects of statins on renal function [^111NwViD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

This report reviews data on the development of proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) for dyslipidemia. Although subgroup analyses of statin trials have shown cardiovascular benefits in subjects with chronic kidney disease, concern about statin-induced proteinuria remains high.

Experimental studies have suggested that the proteinuria seen with statin treatment results from the inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis, the likely mechanism of protein uptake in proximal tubular cells. Transient proteinuria may signify little more than the effective inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at this site. The blockade of protein trafficking in tubular cells is thought to reduce inflammation, slow fibrosis, and diminish proteinuria in the long term. Post hoc analyses of large clinical trials in subjects without overt renal disease have generally supported this notion, showing that statins most benefit patients with the greatest baseline renal deficits.

Statins have also been shown to preserve glomerular filtration rate and reduce proteinuria in subjects with nondiabetic renal disease. In conclusion, in the absence of prospective, randomized trials in renally impaired patients, the collective evidence indicates that statin therapy may slow the decrease in renal function that generally attends atherosclerotic disease. The incidence of proteinuria with potent statins is only 1% to 2% when these drugs are given in recommended doses.

### Atorvastatin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on hemodialysis [^112dEoc8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are at high cardiovascular risk. Lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins reduces the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. In contrast, two randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trials have been completed in hemodialysis patients that showed no significant effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A post hoc analysis was conducted of the 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyze) study to investigate whether LDL-cholesterol at baseline is predictive of cardiovascular events and whether the effect of atorvastatin on clinical outcomes depends on LDL-cholesterol at baseline.

- **Results**: High concentrations of LDL-cholesterol by tendency increased the risks of cardiac endpoints and all-cause mortality. Concordantly, atorvastatin significantly reduced the rates of adverse outcomes in the highest quartile of LDL-cholesterol (≥ 145 mg/dl, 3.76 mmol/L). The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 0.69 (0.48 to 1.00) for the composite primary endpoint, 0.58 (0.34 to 0.99) for cardiac death, 0.48 (0.25 to 0.94) for sudden cardiac death, 0.62 (0.33 to 1.17) for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.68 (0.47 to 0.98) for all cardiac events combined, and 0.72 (0.52 to 0.99) for death from all causes, respectively. No such decrease was seen in any of the other quartiles of LDL-cholesterol at baseline.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis, atorvastatin significantly reduces the risk of adverse outcomes in those with high baseline LDL-cholesterol.

### Efficacy and safety of lipid lowering by alirocumab in chronic kidney disease [^1153BZqK]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Many of these individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are unable to achieve optimal levels on statins and require additional lipid-lowering therapy. To study this, we compared the LDL-C-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with hypercholesterolemia and impaired renal function, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m², to those without impaired renal function (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²).

A total of 4,629 hypercholesterolemic individuals, with or without impaired renal function, were pooled from eight phase 3 ODYSSEY trials. These trials involved double-blind treatments lasting from 24 to 104 weeks. Participants received alirocumab 150 mg or 75/150 mg every two weeks, compared to placebo or ezetimibe. Overall, 10.1% of participants had impaired renal function, and over 99% were receiving statin treatment. Baseline LDL-C levels were comparable between the alirocumab and control groups in the subgroups analyzed.

By week 24, LDL-C reductions ranged from 46.1% to 62.2% in individuals with impaired renal function and from 48.3% to 60.1% in those without. Similar reductions were observed for lipoprotein(a), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides. Safety data were comparable across treatment subgroups, regardless of the degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, renal function did not change over time in response to alirocumab.

This post hoc efficacy analysis is limited by the evaluation of alirocumab treatment effects on renal and lipid parameters through serum biochemistry. Nonetheless, alirocumab consistently lowered LDL-C regardless of renal function status.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^113WaEqC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and this association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes is also observed in patients with relatively normal kidney function. The intricate interaction between the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CVD results from the fact that both share common risk factors, such as age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.

Kidney function decline due to these factors usually displays a linear course over the years, and the grade of kidney function decline has recently been demonstrated to be useful as an independent risk factor for mortality, CVD, and/or ESRD in both CKD and non-CKD populations. Because of its linearity, the slope visualizing the course of kidney function during a given time span — instead of single kidney function measurements — provides additional information. In addition, individual slopes include information about the preceding course of kidney function and may therefore not completely depend on the severity of kidney function impairment at the baseline measurement of a study. Individual slopes over time, therefore, are potentially an important predictor for both CVD and kidney outcomes over the long run.

Thus, interventions that beneficially influence slope over time may also reflect cardiovascular and renal protection at an early stage, as has already been demonstrated with other kidney-protective agents such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

### Statin therapy before transition to end-stage renal disease with posttransition outcomes [^113pBW8Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Paradoxically, despite the fact that in the general population, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are strong risk factors indicating a recommendation for statin treatment, in this cohort of patients transitioning to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the statin benefit was stronger in patients without these comorbidities. This observation is consistent with a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showing a trend toward diminished benefit of statins in patients with diabetes mellitus compared with those without diabetes mellitus in terms of coronary death. One potential explanation for these findings may be that patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and preexisting CVD or diabetes mellitus have more advanced vascular disease, which renders statin therapy to be less effective in altering outcomes.

Diabetes mellitus and CVD have both been associated with reduced endothelial function, and statin-mediated vascular responsiveness may be lower in more advanced disease. In addition, statins are involved in stabilizing plaques with soft lipid cores. Patients with diabetes mellitus and CVD comorbidity may have more fibrous plaques and medial calcification that are less vulnerable and may benefit less from statin-induced plaque stabilization. However, future studies will need to evaluate these findings in more detail.

Our data also show a stronger impact of statin therapy on outcomes in blacks compared with nonblacks. Previous studies have shown similar results in hypertensive patients and in transplant patients. Moreover, our group has also shown that blacks have better nutritional statu.

### Disparate effects of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin on C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1162ZGsG]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The ability of high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict cardiovascular risk has been confirmed in diverse population cohorts, including patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with lower hsCRP levels after statin therapy exhibit better clinical outcomes, regardless of the resultant level of LDL. Reduction in LDL and hsCRP are independent indicators of the success of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk. To assess any differences between the effects of long and short half-life statins on hsCRP and its variability, we conducted a crossover study with equivalent lipid-lowering doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^1157hV7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Modeled slopes of reciprocal of serum creatinine were assessed across the three groups: placebo [green], atorvastatin 10 mg [black], and 80 mg [red]. In order to perform a formal comparison between the atorvastatin doses, the TNT data set was analyzed. This analysis showed a significant dose effect of atorvastatin on the average annual change in kidney function. For patients randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, the slope was significantly lower (estimate [SE] of 0.012 [0.0007] (mg/dL)⁻¹) compared with the slope observed in the 80 mg group (0.015 [0.0007] (mg/dL)⁻¹), with P = 0.0009.

The eGFR slopes demonstrated a similar pattern. The placebo and atorvastatin doses of 10 mg and 80 mg had slopes (estimate [SE]) of 0.25 (0.068), 0.51 (0.054), and 0.78 (0.056) mL/(min·1.73 m²) per year, respectively (P = 0.0002 for placebo and P < 0.0001 for atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg). Adjusted models had a negligible effect on the slopes (data not shown). These findings roughly translate to an eGFR increase of 1.3, 2.6, and 3.9 mL/(min·1.73 m²) over a five-year period for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively. In the formal comparison using the TNT data, a dose effect was observed again, with estimates of 0.58 [0.065] and 0.86 [0.065] mL/(min·1.73 m²) in the atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg groups, respectively (P = 0.003).

### American Diabetes Association indications for statins in diabetes: Is there evidence [^115pQySq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question of who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless?

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies in patients with chronic kidney disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: 2-year results from Getting to an improved understanding of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and dyslipidemia management (GOULD) [^114Qxczh]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

While overall statin use among patients with CKD is high, there have only been modest increases in the use of high‐intensity statin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9i over the course of this prospective 2‐year study. The use of ezetimibe and PCSK9i did not differ by CKD stage, but unfortunately, statin use was lower in those with lower eGFR. Studies of PCSK9i and ezetimibe have shown similar benefits in cardiovascular outcomes across eGFR groups in this high‐risk population. Despite ASCVD being a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD, a majority of patients in this study did not achieve an atheroprotective LDL‐C goal of < 70 mg/dL. This highlights a key opportunity to improve quality of care and outcomes in the CKD population.

### Atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis [^112SR2AN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Statins reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the benefit of statins in such patients receiving hemodialysis, who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and death, has not been examined.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, prospective study of 1,255 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving maintenance hemodialysis. They were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of atorvastatin per day or a matching placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from cardiac causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Secondary endpoints included death from all causes and all cardiac and cerebrovascular events combined.

- **Results**: After four weeks of treatment, the median level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 42 percent among patients receiving atorvastatin, and by 1.3 percent among those receiving placebo. During a median follow-up period of four years, 469 patients (37 percent) reached the primary endpoint, of whom 226 were assigned to atorvastatin and 243 to placebo (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.10; P = 0.37). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on the individual components of the primary endpoint, except that the relative risk of fatal stroke among those receiving the drug was 2.03 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 3.93; P = 0.04). Atorvastatin reduced the rate of all cardiac events combined (relative risk, 0.82; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.03), which was nominally significant.

### American Diabetes Association indications for statins in diabetes: Is there evidence [^113ncpqA]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

None of the clinical outcome trials were treat-to-target LDL trials; all were based on a fixed-dose statin algorithm disregarding the reduction in LDL achieved. Thus, it would not be wholly adequate to blame the mere reduction in LDL for the beneficial effect noted. As proven by the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT TIMI22) trial and others, at least part of the statin effect can be analyzed through its reduction of other surrogate markers such as CRP. A more prudent evidence-based approach would support a fixed high-dose atorvastatin regimen for all diabetic patients with proven coronary heart disease, with an exclusion criterion of an initial LDL cholesterol < 70 mg% due to lack of evidence.

Currently, trials that try to answer some of the questions raised above are underway. The IMPROVE-IT trial [Examining Outcomes in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome: Vytorin (Ezetimibe/Simvastatin) versus Simvastatin], programmed to end by 2011, will assess the additive value of ezetimibe therapy to statin therapy in high-risk patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. HPS2-THRIVE (Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) and AIM-HIGH (Athero-thrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes study) both include high-risk patients, including those with diabetes and documented vascular disease, and examine a possible additive effect of a new extended-release niacin formulation to statin therapy on "hard" cardiovascular outcomes.
