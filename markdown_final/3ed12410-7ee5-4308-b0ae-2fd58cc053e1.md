## Question

Do you give aspirin and plavix to someone getting a heparin drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) should be administered together with a heparin drip, and how to weigh the benefits and bleeding risks of this triple antithrombotic combination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context in which this combination is typically used. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence supporting dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) plus heparin in acute coronary syndromes. Next, I will quantify bleeding risks and consider patient-specific modifiers. After that, I should review guideline positions and dosing details. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight exceptions and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. The combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and intravenous unfractionated heparin is most commonly used in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including non–ST-elevation ACS and ST-elevation MI managed with fibrinolysis or early invasive strategy, where both platelet activation and thrombin generation drive ischemic risk and warrant concurrent antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy [^113UnMg9] [^114fFRVo] [^114kgoLj].

> I need to check the evidence base for adding clopidogrel to aspirin in ACS, particularly with background heparin. The CURE trial in NSTEMI/UA showed that clopidogrel plus aspirin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by about 20% versus aspirin alone, and critically, 92% of patients received heparin or LMWH with similar bleeding patterns to the overall cohort, supporting the safety of this triple approach in ACS when indicated [^112NS2zt] [^114Wxd3C]. In STEMI treated with fibrinolysis, CLARITY-TIMI 28 demonstrated improved infarct-related artery patency and fewer ischemic events when clopidogrel was added to aspirin and heparin, again reinforcing benefit of triple therapy in that setting [^113prcks] [^114kgoLj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bleeding. I should quantify the hemorrhagic risk of combining aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. Major bleeding is increased with DAPT versus aspirin alone in ACS, with an absolute increase of roughly 11 per 1000 patients over one year in pooled analyses, and adding heparin further elevates bleeding risk via pharmacodynamic synergy, particularly at invasive access sites and the gastrointestinal tract [^111vigrz] [^117BeNQT]. But wait, I should verify whether this translates into prohibitive harm in ACS trials; in CURE, the excess bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin occurred without an increase in intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding, and the net clinical benefit remained favorable in the ACS population studied [^114Wxd3C].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure alignment. Contemporary and historical guidelines consistently endorse DAPT plus anticoagulation in ACS: ACCP recommends aspirin plus clopidogrel with UFH, LMWH, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux in NSTE-ACS, and in STEMI they recommend clopidogrel in addition to aspirin and antithrombin therapy during the acute phase, reflecting the ischemic benefit outweighs bleeding risk in appropriately selected patients [^113UnMg9] [^114fFRVo]. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline similarly supports antiplatelet therapy with anticoagulation in ACS, with attention to minimizing bleeding exposure over time, especially when oral anticoagulation is also required post-discharge [^114WeQx6].

> I will now examine dosing specifics to ensure practical accuracy. For clopidogrel, a 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily is standard in ACS; for aspirin, 162–325 mg loading then 75–100 mg daily is recommended; for UFH, typical practice is a weight-based bolus with infusion titrated to aPTT, often alongside early invasive management and with consideration of radial access to mitigate bleeding risk [^113UnMg9] [^114vx1DH] [^115oxztc]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance: in NSTE-ACS, if angiography will occur within 24 hours, some guidelines suggest initiating clopidogrel after anatomy is known to balance bleeding risk, though many centers still give upstream therapy based on risk stratification and operator judgment [^112ZzFQS].

> But wait, what if the patient has high bleeding risk or special circumstances. I should double-check modifiers: advanced age, low body weight, renal dysfunction, prior bleeding, and access site choice all increase bleeding with triple therapy; radial access and careful aPTT monitoring can mitigate risk, and in patients who also require chronic oral anticoagulation, current guidance favors minimizing or avoiding aspirin after the initial month, using a P2Y12 inhibitor plus oral anticoagulant to reduce bleeding while preserving ischemic protection [^114WeQx6] [^114BecDu]. Hold on, I should verify perioperative contexts too; if urgent surgery is needed, clopidogrel should generally be held 5 days pre-op while aspirin is often continued, given its irreversible effect and the thrombotic risk of withdrawal in ACS [^1119UekR].

> Let me synthesize a direct answer. Yes, in patients with ACS, it is appropriate to administer aspirin and clopidogrel together with a heparin drip because this triple antithrombotic regimen reduces ischemic events and is guideline-supported, provided bleeding risk is acceptable and appropriate precautions are taken; the ischemic benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin persists across subgroups including those receiving heparin, and bleeding can be managed with careful dosing, monitoring, and access-site strategies [^112NS2zt] [^113UnMg9] [^111hJ4st] [^115oxztc]. I should confirm exceptions: in patients with prohibitive bleeding risk, recent major hemorrhage, or planned early surgery, the regimen may need modification or deferral, and in those who also require chronic oral anticoagulation, aspirin should be discontinued early to limit triple therapy duration [^114WeQx6] [^114BecDu].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical safeguards. Monitor for bleeding at access sites, gastrointestinal tract, and mucosa; check hemoglobin and aPTT per protocol; use proton pump inhibition for GI risk; and reassess daily whether ongoing triple therapy is still indicated as the patient transitions to definitive management and discharge planning [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that patient education includes reporting any bleeding promptly, since clopidogrel's irreversible effect and heparin's anticoagulation can compound hemorrhagic complications if unrecognized [^115xsBA7].

In select patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or during PCI, **aspirin and clopidogrel are given with a heparin drip** to reduce ischemic events [^112NS2zt] [^113prcks], but this increases bleeding risk [^111vigrz] and requires close monitoring [^114vx1DH]. Use this combination only when the ischemic benefit clearly outweighs the bleeding risk, and monitor for bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and drug interactions [^116aBMxy].

---

## Clinical indications for combined therapy

The combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin is **indicated in specific clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**: Both non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel, plus anticoagulation with heparin [^113UnMg9] [^114fFRVo].

- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: Patients undergoing PCI, particularly with stent placement, require DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis, with heparin used intra-procedurally for anticoagulation [^115Csuua].

- **Fibrinolytic therapy**: In STEMI patients receiving fibrinolytics, clopidogrel added to aspirin and heparin improves vessel patency and reduces ischemic events [^113prcks].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combined therapy

Several **large randomized controlled trials** demonstrate the benefits of combining aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Intervention** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CURE | NSTE-ACS | Clopidogrel + aspirin + heparin vs. aspirin + heparin | - Reduced cardiovascular death, MI, stroke <br/> - Increased major bleeding [^112NS2zt] |
| CLARITY-TIMI 28 | STEMI (fibrinolysis) | Clopidogrel + aspirin + heparin vs. aspirin + heparin | - Improved vessel patency <br/> - Reduced ischemic events [^113prcks] |
| COMMIT | Suspected MI (93% STEMI) | Clopidogrel + aspirin vs. aspirin alone | - Reduced death, reinfarction, stroke <br/> - No significant excess bleeding [^114kgoLj] |

---

These studies show that adding clopidogrel to aspirin and heparin **reduces ischemic events** but **increases bleeding risk** [^112NS2zt] [^114Wxd3C].

---

## Risks and complications of combined therapy

While the combination provides significant antithrombotic benefits, it also **increases the risk of bleeding complications**:

- **Major bleeding**: Increased risk of gastrointestinal, intracranial, and procedural bleeding [^114Wxd3C].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious complication requiring immediate intervention [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Clopidogrel and aspirin interact with heparin, increasing bleeding risk [^117BeNQT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) **provide clear recommendations** on the use of combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy:

- **ACS management**: Recommended to use aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin in ACS patients, with careful monitoring of bleeding risk [^113UnMg9] [^114fFRVo].

- **PCI procedures**: Aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended before and after PCI, with heparin used intra-procedurally [^115Csuua].

- **Duration of therapy**: DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for 12 months post-ACS or PCI, with adjustments based on bleeding risk and clinical judgment [^112S2kG1].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Given the increased bleeding risk, **close monitoring and management strategies are essential**:

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regular complete blood counts (CBC), platelet counts, and coagulation parameters (aPTT, ACT) should be monitored [^114HagFN].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for signs of bleeding, bruising, or unusual symptoms [^115xsBA7].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about bleeding risks and instructed to report any bleeding promptly [^115xsBA7].

- **Individualized risk assessment**: Use clinical judgment to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, adjusting therapy as needed [^114BecDu].

---

## Alternative anticoagulant therapies

In patients at high bleeding risk or those who develop complications such as HIT, **alternative anticoagulants** may be considered:

- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran are alternatives in specific clinical scenarios, though not routinely used in ACS management [^114aYK5z].

- **Bivalirudin**: A direct thrombin inhibitor used in PCI, particularly in patients at high bleeding risk [^115Csuua].

- **Fondaparinux**: A synthetic factor Xa inhibitor used in ACS, particularly in patients at high bleeding risk [^113jKWYo].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In select clinical scenarios, such as ACS and PCI, **aspirin and clopidogrel are given with a heparin drip** to reduce ischemic events [^112NS2zt] [^113prcks]. This strategy increases bleeding risk [^117BeNQT], requiring careful monitoring and individualized risk assessment. Clinicians should balance ischemic and bleeding risks, educate patients, and adjust therapy based on clinical judgment and guideline recommendations [^114WeQx6].

14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome

CURE

The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients ≥ 65 years of age.

Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.

The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the Plavix-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%–28%; p < 0.001) for the Plavix-treated group (see Table 4).

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.

Bleeding

CURE

In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see Table 1). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.

The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

Ninety-two percent (92%) of the patients in the CURE study received heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and the rate of bleeding in these patients was similar to the overall results.

COMMIT

In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see Table 2).

CAPRIE (Plavix vs. Aspirin)

In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix vs. 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.

Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.

Other Adverse Events

In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.

In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^113WMtxj]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

### Clopidogrel bisulfate [^116aBMxy]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix):

- Bleeding: use caution in patients taking other drugs increasing the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and long-term NSAIDs. Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgeries with a major risk of bleeding.
- Cardiovascular events: use caution when discontinuing clopidogrel. Restart clopidogrel as soon as possible if temporarily discontinued.
- Drug hypersensitivity reaction: use caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.
- TTP: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel.

### Clopidogrel (plavix) [^113wnj3Z]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, indicated for the prevention of ischemic stroke and in-stent thrombosis. However, it has a number of drawbacks, including an increased risk of hemorrhage; a clinical effect that is slow in onset and irreversible; a genetically determined variability in its clinical potency; and interactions with other commonly administered drugs.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^111hJ4st]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, nonstudy antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Objective

To review the rationale, clinical practice guideline recommendations, and clinical trial data describing bleeding and clinical outcomes associated with the use of the combination of aspirin, a thienopyridine, and warfarin.

Data Sources

An English-language literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-March 2008) and the search terms aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, thienopyridine, warfarin, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Additional references were identified by reviewing reference citations of articles retrieved.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Applicable data were extracted from published reports and studies that included either clinical outcomes or adverse events.

Data Synthesis

Clinical guidelines recommend the combination of antiplatelets and anticoagulants based largely on writing committee consensus. To date, only one randomized clinical trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy (ie, triple antithrombotic therapy). Other published data are from case series, observational studies, and case-controlled studies primarily of patients undergoing PCI with intracoronary stent placement. Four of 12 studies reported no increased risk of major bleeding events. In the other 8 studies, a 3- to 6-fold increase in bleeding events was reported with triple antithrombotic therapy. Ischemic events were reported in only 6 of the studies. Only 2 studies observed an additional benefit in the reduction of ischemic events, and 1 study reported worsened ischemic outcomes with the triple antithrombotic regimen compared with dual antithrombotic therapy.

Conclusions

Available guidelines pertaining to the concomitant administration of aspirin, a thienopyridine, and warfarin are based on limited trial data and consensus judgment. Overall, selection of triple antithrombotic therapy for patients with vascular disease is considered a matter of clinical judgment for an individual patient based on the prescriber's perceived balance between the patient's risk for recurrent ischemic events, expected duration of treatment, and patient's risk for bleeding.

### Current antiplatelet therapies: benefits and limitations [^1148FsCo]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the current criterion standard for the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and patients who have acute coronary syndromes. Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin is the current standard of care for reducing cardiovascular events in these patients. However, patients who receive currently available antiplatelet therapy may still develop atherothrombotic events. In addition, despite the clinical benefits achieved with clopidogrel, significant clinical limitations are associated with its use. This article summarizes the current understanding of the benefits and limitations of the commonly used antiplatelet therapies.

Aspirin — preventive limits and rescue dosing — Only a fraction (usually one-fourth to one-third) of all vascular complications can be prevented by aspirin alone, and there is no evidence that patients who experience a thrombotic event despite aspirin therapy benefit from treatment with higher-dose aspirin.

Randomization and study procedures

Patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either pre-treatment with UFH at FMC or routine administration in the Cath Lab, using an interactive web-based response system with a stratified block randomization scheme. All of the patients will receive a loading dose of DAPT, comprising 300 mg aspirin and either 180 mg ticagrelor or 300–600 mg clopidogrel at FMC immediately following diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG). Pre-treated UFH was required to be administered as an initial dose of 100 U/kg intravenous bolus within 10 min after randomization at FMC and should be finished at least before transportation to the Cath Lab. In the Cath Lab group, an initial dose of 100 U/kg UFH was encouraged to be administered through an artery sheath, but the acute dosage was left to the interventional cardiologist's discretion. In both groups, additional UFH was allowed to be administered during PPCI if the activated clotting time was < 225 s or if the physician determined it necessary, with 1000 U UFH given hourly during patient transport. Premedication with low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI), or other antithrombotic medications was not allowed in any patient before PPCI. However, provisional GPI use was permitted during or after catheterization at the investigator's discretion. The PPCI was preferred using the radial artery approach and performed according to standard clinical practice. A 12/18-lead ECG was repeated at 90 min after PPCI. Other medications were provided as recommended in current guidelines. Follow-up was performed 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after random assignment through office visits or telephone interviews.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113cNxE6]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The article describes the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of aspirin, dipyridamole, cilostazol, the thienopyridines, and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists. The relationships among dose, efficacy, and safety are discussed along with a mechanistic overview of results of randomized clinical trials. The article does not provide specific management recommendations but highlights important practical aspects of antiplatelet therapy, including optimal dosing, the variable balance between benefits and risks when antiplatelet therapies are used alone or in combination with other antiplatelet drugs in different clinical settings, and the implications of persistently high platelet reactivity despite such treatment.

Procedural care and intraoperative monitoring — Diagnostic catheter angiography is generally performed with analgesia and sedation according to institutional standards, and interventional treatments are frequently performed with either monitored or general anesthesia; all patients should undergo continuous cardiac and intermittent blood pressure monitoring, with invasive blood pressure monitoring as appropriate, pulse oximetry if sedated, a record of vital signs maintained, intravenous access secured, and activated clotting time measurements available when heparin is administered. While not a standard of care, patients taking antithrombotic agents including aspirin or clopidogrel may be evaluated using aggregometry such as VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, California, USA).

Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in peripheral artery disease — patients with PAD should receive aspirin. Although there is no evidence of clinical benefit for dual antiplatelet therapy to support endovascular FP treatment, it is common practice after intervention to add a thienopyridine (typically clopidogrel) for 1–3 months to daily aspirin, and prasugrel or ticagrelor may be considered when a second agent is deemed beneficial but clopidogrel cannot be tolerated. For intraprocedural anticoagulation, unfractionated heparin has been used and offers lower cost and reversibility with protamine in the event of hemorrhage.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114pZ8NS]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendations" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend administration of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke of > 3 h but < 4.5 h, we suggest clinicians do not use IV tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with acute stroke onset of > 4.5 h, we recommend against the use of IV tPA (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy (Grade 1A). For acute ischemic stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins (Grade 1A). For long-term stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A), including aspirin (recommended dose, 50–100 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or clopidogrel (75 mg qd). In these patients, we recommend use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25/200 mg bid) over aspirin (Grade 1A) and suggest clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B), and recommend avoiding long-term use of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1A). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low-molecular-weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

### The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116wGkvC]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). The primary objectives of this article are the following: (1) to address the perioperative management of patients who are receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and require an elective surgical or other invasive procedures; and (2) to address the perioperative use of bridging anticoagulation, typically with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). A secondary objective is to address the perioperative management of such patients who require urgent surgery. The recommendations in this article incorporate the grading system that is discussed in this supplement (Guyatt G et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Briefly, Grade 1 recommendations are considered strong and indicate that the benefits do (or do not) outweigh risks, burden, and costs, whereas Grade 2 recommendations are referred to as suggestions and imply that individual patient values may lead to different management choices. The key recommendations in this article include the following: in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose subcutaneous (SC) LMWH or IV UFH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 1C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at moderate risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH, therapeutic-dose IV UFH, or low-dose SC LMWH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 2C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at low risk for thromboembolism, we suggest low-dose SC LMWH or no bridging over bridging with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH or IV UFH (Grade 2C). In patients with a bare metal coronary stent who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C); in patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C). In patients who are undergoing minor dental procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure and co-administering an oral prohemostatic agent (Grade 1B); in patients who are undergoing minor dermatologic procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C); in patients who are undergoing cataract removal and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C).

### Addition of clopidogrel to aspirin and fibrinolytic therapy for myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation [^113prcks]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy for myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation have inadequate reperfusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, leading to an increased risk of complications and death.

Methods

We enrolled 3491 patients, 18 to 75 years of age, who presented within 12 hours after the onset of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and randomly assigned them to receive clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo. Patients received a fibrinolytic agent, aspirin, and when appropriate, heparin (dispensed according to body weight) and were scheduled to undergo angiography 48 to 192 hours after the start of study medication. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of an occluded infarct-related artery (defined by a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade of 0 or 1) on angiography or death or recurrent myocardial infarction before angiography.

Results

The rates of the primary efficacy end point were 21.7 percent in the placebo group and 15.0 percent in the clopidogrel group, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7 percentage points in the rate and a 36 percent reduction in the odds of the end point with clopidogrel therapy (95 percent confidence interval, 24 to 47 percent; P < 0.001). By 30 days, clopidogrel therapy reduced the odds of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia leading to the need for urgent revascularization by 20 percent (from 14.1 to 11.6 percent, P = 0.03). The rates of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

In patients 75 years of age or younger who have myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation and who receive aspirin and a standard fibrinolytic regimen, the addition of clopidogrel improves the patency rate of the infarct-related artery and reduces ischemic complications.

### Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114fFRVo]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about fibrinolytic, antiplatelet, and antithrombin treatment for acute ST-segment elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of ≤ 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend that all undergo rapid evaluation for reperfusion (primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or fibrinolytic) therapy and have a reperfusion strategy implemented promptly after contact with the health-care system (Grade 1A). For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of ≤ 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend administration of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over no fibrinolytic therapy (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration ≤ 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase or tenecteplase over streptokinase (both Grade 1A). We recommend aspirin over no aspirin therapy followed by indefinite therapy (Grade 1A); we also recommend clopidogrel in addition to aspirin for up to 28 days (Grade 1A). In addition to aspirin and other antiplatelet therapies, we recommend the use of antithrombin therapy (eg, unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, or fondaparinux) over no antithrombin therapy (Grade 1A), including for those patients receiving fibrinolysis (and regardless of which lytic agent is administered), primary PCI, or patients not receiving reperfusion therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^112ZzFQS]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we recommend immediate and then daily oral aspirin (Grade 1A). For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend immediate treatment with clopidogrel, 300-mg bolus po, followed by 75 mg/d indefinitely (Grade 1A). In all NSTE ACS patients in whom diagnostic catheterization will be delayed or when coronary bypass surgery will not occur until > 5 days, we recommend clopidogrel as bolus therapy (300 mg), followed by 75 mg/d for 9 to 12 months in addition to aspirin (Grade 1A). In NSTE ACS patients in whom angiography will take place within 24 h, we suggest beginning clopidogrel after the coronary anatomy has been determined (Grade 2A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we recommend discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). In moderate- to high-risk patients presenting with NSTE ACS, we recommend either eptifibatide or tirofiban for initial (early) treatment in addition to treatment with aspirin and heparin (Grade 1A). For the acute treatment of NSTE ACS, we recommend low molecular weight heparins over unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 1B] and UFH over no heparin therapy use with antiplatelet therapies (Grade 1A). We recommend against the direct thrombin inhibitors as routine initial antithrombin therapy (Grade 1B). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and with stable CAD, we recommend aspirin in doses from 75 to 325 mg as initial therapy and in doses of 75 to 162 mg as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend long-term clopidogrel (Grade 1A). For primary prevention in patients with at least moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [Grade 2A]; for patients at particularly high risk of events in whom the international normalized ratio (INR) can be monitored without difficulty, we suggest low-dose VKA (target INR, 1.5) [Grade 2A].

### Platelet-active drugs: the relationships among dose, effectiveness, and side effects: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^117XKvaJ]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses platelet active drugs as part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. New data on antiplatelet agents include the following: (1) the role of aspirin in primary prevention has been the subject of recommendations based on the assessment of cardiovascular risk; (2) an increasing number of reports suggest a substantial interindividual variability in the response to antiplatelet agents, and various phenomena of "resistance" to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel; (3) the benefit/risk profile of currently available glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists is substantially uncertain for patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not routinely scheduled for early revascularization; (4) there is an expanding role for the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in the long-term management of high-risk patients; and (5) the cardiovascular effects of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been the subject of increasing attention.

### New antithrombotic drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111mZBR1]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy for cardiovascular prevention — current agents and combinations — includes that currently available oral antiplatelet drugs include aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and dipyridamole, and the need for IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has declined because of more potent oral agents. Although the benefits of aspirin for secondary prevention outweigh bleeding risks, aspirin is of limited usefulness for primary prevention, including primary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; meta-analyses question its usefulness in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration found insufficient evidence to support over-the-counter use of aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular events in such patients. On its own, clopidogrel has been shown to be only marginally more effective than aspirin. The combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel is superior to aspirin alone in high-risk patients but is associated with a significant risk of bleeding and has yielded disappointing results in patients with stable cardiovascular disease; in cerebrovascular disease, aspirin plus dipyridamole is superior to aspirin alone for secondary prevention and its efficacy is similar to that of clopidogrel.

### How I use laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet therapy [^115xtRy5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is of proven benefit in coronary artery disease and a number of other clinical settings. This article reviews platelet function, molecular targets of antiplatelet agents, and clinical indications for antiplatelet therapy before focusing on a frequent question to hematologists about the 2 most commonly used antiplatelet therapies: Could the patient be aspirin "resistant" or clopidogrel "resistant"? If so, should results of a platelet function test be used to guide the dose or type of antiplatelet therapy? Whether such guided therapy is of clinical benefit to patients has been a source of controversy. The present article reviews this subject in the context of 2 prototypical clinical cases. Available evidence does not support the use of laboratory tests to guide the dose of aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with so-called aspirin or clopidogrel "resistance".

### Critical pathways using platelet testing to potentially optimize the use of oral antiplatelet therapy [^114ojgYj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Although monitoring anticoagulation is standard practice, monitoring antiplatelet therapy has not yet widely been adopted as a means of assessing antithrombotic response. However, bedside devices have recently become available that facilitate more rapid assessment of antithrombotic response, allowing this information to be developed into a critical pathway. Three major opportunities exist for oral antiplatelet therapy: (1) optimizing the dose of aspirin for long-term therapy; (2) optimizing the dose of clopidogrel, especially in percutaneous coronary intervention, acutely and during long-term therapy; and (3) evaluating the level of platelet inhibition before coronary artery bypass grafting or other major surgery. Several critical pathways are proposed that may assist clinicians in trying to ensure adequate platelet inhibition in these important clinical situations.

### Antithrombotic therapy during percutaneous coronary intervention: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115Csuua]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004;126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients undergoing PCI, we recommend pretreatment with aspirin, 75 to 325 mg (Grade 1A). For long-term treatment after PCI, we recommend aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d (Grade 1A). For long-term treatment after PCI in patients who receive antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel or warfarin, we recommend lower-dose aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/d (Grade 1C+). For patients who undergo stent placement, we recommend the combination of aspirin and a thienopyridine derivative (ticlopidine or clopidogrel) over systemic anticoagulation therapy (Grade 1A). We recommend clopidogrel over ticlopidine (Grade 1A). For all patients undergoing PCI, particularly those undergoing primary PCI, or those with refractory unstable angina or other high-risk features, we recommend use of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa antagonist (abciximab or eptifibatide) [Grade 1A]. In patients undergoing PCI for ST-segment elevation MI, we recommend abciximab over eptifibatide (Grade 1B). In patients undergoing PCI, we recommend against the use of tirofiban as an alternative to abciximab (Grade 1A). In patients after uncomplicated PCI, we recommend against routine postprocedural infusion of heparin (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing PCI who are not treated with a GP IIb-IIIa antagonist, we recommend bivalirudin over heparin during PCI (Grade 1A). In PCI patients who are at low risk for complications, we recommend bivalirudin as an alternative to heparin as an adjunct to GP IIb-IIIa antagonists (Grade 1B). In PCI patients who are at high risk for bleeding, we recommend that bivalirudin over heparin as an adjunct to GP IIb-IIIa antagonists (Grade 1B). In patients who undergo PCI with no other indication for systemic anticoagulation therapy, we recommend against routine use of vitamin K antagonists after PCI (Grade 1A).

### New recommendations from the 1999 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines [^113wPcCs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy De-escalation strategies [^111DfXSF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of aspirin (ASA), and a P2Y 12 inhibitor, protects against stent thrombosis and new atherothrombotic events after a stent implantation or an acute coronary syndrome, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding. In most current practices, the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped at 6 to 12 months and ASA is continued indefinitely. The advent of safer stents, with less risk of stent thrombosis, has challenged this standard of care, however. A number of alternative strategies involving earlier de-escalation of the antiplatelet therapy have therefore been proposed. In these approaches, standard DAPT is switched to a less potent antithrombotic combination at an earlier time-point than recommended by guidelines. Three different de-escalation variations have been tested to date. The first one maintains DAPT but switches from the potent P2Y 12 inhibitors ticagrelor or prasugrel to either a lower dose or to clopidogrel, while maintaining ASA. The 2 other approaches involve changing DAPT to a single antiplatelet at some earlier time-point after the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, by stopping either the P2Y 12 inhibitor or ASA. These strategies have all demonstrated some benefit in clinical trials so far, but especially the contribution of ASA in secondary prevention is clearly evolving as its role in increasing bleeding complications while not providing increased ischemic benefit is becoming more and more clear. In contemporary practice, the type and duration of DAPT should now be based on an individualized decision, and the de-escalation strategies, if used wisely, can be added to the existing options.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1147od5Y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Timing of anticoagulant interruption and restart for surgery is outlined as follows: Recommendations state aspirin is continued for all types of surgeries, and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are stopped for 24 h before minor surgery and 48 h before major surgery, while clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) are held for 5–7 days. Table-based examples specify drug-specific withholding and restart intervals: Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin) and 48–72 h after major surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin); Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h, withhold 24 h for minor and 48 h for major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h uses creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide withholding (CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 24 h for minor, 72 h for major; CrCl < 50 mL: 75 h for minor, 120 h for major) and restart 24 h after minor or 24–48 h after major surgery; Aspirin half-life 7–10 days is "usually continued" and "usually continued" for restart; Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days, withhold 5–7 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery. In case of impaired renal function, withholding intervals for several agents should be prolonged and/or drug levels evaluated.

Vorapaxar phase 2 coronary angiography/possible PCI study — A phase 2 study in 1,031 patients scheduled for coronary angiography and possible PCI randomized patients to vorapaxar at loading doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg or placebo in a 3:1 ratio; a total of 573 patients underwent PCI, all receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, and an anticoagulant (either heparin or bivalirudin), and those randomized to vorapaxar received maintenance therapy at doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg once daily for 2 months; the primary outcome of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major and minor bleeding occurred in 3.3% of 151 placebo patients vs 2.8% of 422 vorapaxar patients, major bleeding occurred in 1.3% vs 0.7%, and the efficacy end point of death, major adverse coronary events, or stroke occurred in 6.8% vs 6.2%, respectively.

Fibrinolytic-treated STEMI antiplatelet dosing and PCI alternatives — In CLARITY-TIMI 28, adding clopidogrel to aspirin in STEMI patients who were < 75 years and received fibrinolytic therapy reduced the odds of an occluded infarct-related artery and the 30-day composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. In COMMIT among suspected myocardial infarction (93% STEMI, 54% fibrinolytic-treated) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (without a loading dose) significantly lowered the composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke and mortality alone, with no significant excess in bleeding versus placebo. Based on the design of these trials, when administered concurrently with fibrinolytic therapy, clopidogrel is recommended to be administered with a loading dose (300 mg, then 75 mg daily) for patients < 75 years of age and starting without a loading dose (75 mg daily) for patients ≥ 75 years of age. For patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent who undergo subsequent PCI, either clopidogrel or ticagrelor (age < 75 years, within 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) or prasugrel (> 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) are alternatives to support PCI. In a trial of 3799 fibrinolytic-treated STEMI patients, 89% of whom also received clopidogrel, ticagrelor initiated at a median of 11.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.8–18.2 hours) after fibrinolysis was noninferior to clopidogrel for major bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113UnMg9]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicans Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions are weaker as there is uncertainty regarding the benefits, risks and costs such that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the "Grades of Recommendation for Antithrombotic Agents" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations are the following: for all patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), without a clear allergy to aspirin, we recommend immediate aspirin (162 to 325 mg po) and then daily oral aspirin (75 to 100 mg) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who are at at least moderate risk for an ischemic event and who will undergo an early invasive management strategy, we recommend "upstream" treatment either with clopidogrel (300 mg po bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) or a small-molecule IV glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide or tirofiban) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who are at least moderate risk for an ischemic event and for whom an early conservative or a delayed invasive strategy of management is to be used, we recommend "upstream" treatment with clopidogrel (300 mg oral bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who undergo PCI, we recommend treatment with both clopidogrel and an IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Grade 1A). We recommend a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel given at least 2 h prior to planned PCI followed by 75 mg/d (Grade 1B). For all patients presenting with NSTE ACS, we recommend anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH or bivalirudin or fondaparinux over no anticoagulation (Grade 1A). For NSTE ACS patients who will undergo an early invasive strategy of management, we recommend UFH (with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor) over either LMWH or fondaparinux (Grade 1B). For NSTE ACS patients in whom an early conservative or a delayed invasive strategy of management is to be used, we recommend fondaparinux over enoxaparin (Grade 1A) and LMWH over UFH (Grade 1B). We recommend continuing LMWH during PCI treatment of patients with NSTE ACS when it has been started as the "upstream" anticoagulant (Grade 1B). In low- to moderate-risk patients with NSTE ACS undergoing PCI, we recommend either bivalirudin with provisional ("bail-out") GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors or UFH plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor over alternative antithrombotic regimens (Grade 1B).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Antithrombotic strategy in patients requiring both oral anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelet therapy (APT) — the ISAR-TRIPLE trial randomized 614 patients on oral anticoagulant therapy undergoing PCI with a drug-eluting stent to 6 weeks versus 6 months of clopidogrel on a background of continued aspirin and OAC, finding no significant difference in ischemic events (hazard ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.43 to 2.05) and no reduction in Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding (hazard ratio: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.84); an alternative approach continues an AC and P2Y12i with discontinuation of aspirin at discharge or soon after, with multiple trials showing either no significant difference or noninferiority for ischemic endpoints but superior safety compared with triple therapy; overall, "we recommend against the routine use of triple antithrombotic therapy for most patients", and "we strongly recommend that the default therapy after recent PCI be dual antithrombotic therapy consisting of an AC and a P2Y12i", while if triple therapy is used, "we recommend that it be done for a limited duration (shortest period possible) in patients at high thrombotic risk".

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^1167yfKU]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the 7th ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we recommend administration of i.v. tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with extensive and clearly identifiable hypodensity on CT, we recommend against thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). For unselected patients with AIS of > 3 h but < 6 h, we suggest clinicians not use i.v. tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with AIS, we recommend against streptokinase (Grade 1A) and suggest clinicians not use full-dose anticoagulation with i.v. or subcutaneous heparins or heparinoids (Grade 2B). For patients with AIS who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy, 160 to 325 mg qd (Grade 1A). For AIS patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids (Grade 1A); and for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulants, we recommend use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings (Grade 1C). In patients with acute intracerebral hematoma, we recommend the initial use of intermittent pneumatic compression (Grade 1C+). In patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A) including aspirin, 50 to 325 mg qd; the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25 mg/200 mg bid; or clopidogrel, 75 mg qd. In these patients, we suggest use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25/200 mg bid, over aspirin (Grade 2A) and clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1C+). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low molecular weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

Antiplatelet drug interruption and resumption — For aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, and prasugrel, which irreversibly inhibit platelet function, 7 to 10 days (ie, platelet life span) of interruption is needed to restore platelet function, whereas for ticagrelor, which reversibly inhibits platelet function, at least 2 to 3 days of interruption is needed. After surgery, maximal antiplatelet effect occurs within minutes after ASA, within 2 hours after ticagrelor, 4 to 5 days after resuming clopidogrel, and after 3 days after resuming prasugrel, with a clopidogrel loading dose producing effect between 2 and 6 hours. Less commonly used reversible inhibitors include cilostazol, dipyridamole, and pentoxifylline with half-lives of 2 to 10 hours, and vorapaxar has a prolonged, 3- to 15-day antiplatelet effect. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have reversible antiplatelet properties with half-lives from 2 to 6 hours and approximately 20 hours depending on the agent.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1112ZGGB]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on antiplatelets, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid administering routine bridging therapy with a glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitor, cangrelor, or LMWH in patients with coronary stents requiring interruption of antiplatelet drugs for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Study of two dose regimens of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for stable coronary artery disease [^117XLEMw]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.

Study Design

One hundred eighty patients with stable CAD provided written informed consent and were enrolled into the STEEL-PCI study, conducted at a single center (Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom). All patients had had previous coronary angiography and were planned to undergo PCI. Other inclusion as well as exclusion criteria are shown in the. The study was performed according to a protocol approved by the National Research Ethics Service and regulatory authorities. Aspirin-treated patients who provided informed consent were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive open-label treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor at 2 hours pre-PCI, followed by either 60 mg BID or 90 mg BID for 1 month or a standard loading regimen of clopidogrel (600 mg at least 4 hours prior to procedure or maintenance therapy with 75 mg for at least 5 days), followed by 75 mg QD for 1 month (Figure 1). Blood samples were collected at the time of PCI, either from a large antecubital vein using a 21-G needle and syringe with minimum use of tourniquet or from the arterial sheath, before the administration of heparin. Patients attended the morning after PCI for collection of venous blood samples by venipuncture. At 1 month post-PCI, patients attended before the morning maintenance dose of study medication for further collection of venous blood samples. The maintenance dose was then administered and a further blood sample obtained 2 hours later. Patients were instructed to return unused study medication at their 1-month visit, and compliance was assessed by pill-counting. When indicated, patients were switched to open-label clopidogrel at the 1-month visit by administration of a loading dose 24 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor, as recommended. Staff of the Clinical Research Office of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust monitored the study, and a data monitoring committee periodically reviewed the conduct of the study and clinical outcomes.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116Yg1aH]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

FDA boxed warnings — handling in AHA/ACC guidelines: Boxed warnings by the FDA represent the highest safety-related warning that treatments can be assigned and these warnings are intended to bring attention to important or severe side effects (including life-threatening hazards) of a specific device or drug, and medications can have a boxed warning added, taken away, or updated. To date, over 400 different medications have received boxed warnings by the FDA. The AHA/ACC guideline writing committees should align with the FDA's mission by ascribing, when clinically relevant and impactful, a Class 3 recommendation (for harm) to these drugs or devices; for example, "In patients undergoing [percutaneous coronary intervention] who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, prasugrel should not be administered".

### Clopidogrel kit [^114zegjn]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2,253 patients [36.0%] in the clopidogrel group, 2,324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

Orthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis — aspirin vs low-molecular-weight heparin: Prior AT8 conclusions were that high-quality evidence justified a strong recommendation against aspirin as the sole agent for thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients. AT9 focused on a very large trial using concealed randomization and blinding with near-complete follow-up and concluded there is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of aspirin as an option for patients undergoing major orthopedic procedures, while also concluding there is low-quality evidence supporting a weak recommendation of low-molecular-weight heparin over aspirin.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation on OAC undergoing PCI — aspirin during hospitalization and short-term triple therapy: Low-dose aspirin is recommended for the duration of the hospitalization, and in general, the guidance states to recommend discontinuing it prior to/up on discharge in most patients; although the default approach is dual antiplatelet therapy, because the risk of stent-related thrombotic complications is greatest in the first month post-PCI, one may consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day for 30 days (after which the patient should switch to an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor) in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy following dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving a drug-eluting stent: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^115YLvpH]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

Standard methodologies for conducting and reporting systematic reviews as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were followed. Results for this review were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

2.1 Data Sources and Search Strategies

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) via OvidSP to capture records published up to September 1, 2023 (Supporting Information S1: Tables S1–S5). Additionally, conference abstracts published between 2021 and 2023 from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the British Cardiovascular Society, the ESC, World Stroke, Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutic, and EuroPCR congresses were searched. Searches of United States and European clinical trial registry databases were also conducted to find trials that had reported results that were not already published in peer‐reviewed journals. Lastly, "hand searches" of the reference lists of previously published literature reviews on the same topic were also conducted to capture additional eligible studies that were missed in the electronic database search.

### Cangrelor [^1141yNoX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 CHAMPION PHOENIX Trial

The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial was intended to test whether faster platelet inhibition with cangrelor at the time of PCI would reduce the rate of periprocedural thrombotic events compared to a drug with a slower antiplatelet effect, clopidogrel, given at about the time of PCI. It was a randomized, double-blind study in which patients with coronary artery disease (stable angina, UA/NSTEMI, STEMI) requiring PCI and receiving standard therapy including aspirin and heparin or bivalirudin were randomized 1:1 to cangrelor (n = 5472) or to clopidogrel 300 or 600 mg (n = 5470). Patients who had already taken an oral P2Y12platelet inhibitor were not eligible to enroll. Patients administered glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) or for whom GPI use was planned were also not eligible to enroll. PHOENIX was thus a study of people undergoing PCI who had not been previously treated with anti-platelet therapy other than aspirin.

The primary outcome measure was the first occurrence of any one of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization (IDR), and stent thrombosis (ST) within 48 hours after randomization.

Cangrelor was administered as 30 mcg/kg bolus followed by 4 mcg/kg/min infusion for 2 to 4 hours. Clopidogrel 600 mg was administered immediately at the end of the cangrelor infusion in patients randomized to cangrelor. Clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg was administered shortly before PCI or shortly afterward, in patients randomized to clopidogrel.

Perioperative management of coronary artery stents — bridging and high-risk antiplatelet strategies: Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents with short half-lives have been suggested as a way to bridge the gap between discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy and surgery, but both the 2007 Science Advisory and the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines jointly concluded that there is no evidence that warfarin, antithrombotics, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa agents reduce the risk of stent thrombosis after discontinuation of oral antiplatelet agents. In addition, the 2007 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommend that consideration should be given to continuing dual antiplatelet therapy perioperatively beyond the recommended time frame in any patient at high risk for stent thrombosis, and dual therapy typically consists of a combination of aspirin and thienopyridine.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention — anticoagulation and antiplatelet timing: PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ongoing uninterrupted non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) monotherapy is currently not recommended; in patients not on oral anticoagulant but on stable aspirin, clopidogrel may be given either prior to or during PCI with no apparent outcome differences, and given triple therapy (TAT) bleeding risk it may be considered to withhold the additional antiplatelet until PCI is indicated by diagnostic angiography. The time to effective platelet inhibition with oral clopidogrel is approximately 2 to 6 h depending on a 600 vs 300 mg loading dose, while intravenous cangrelor or aspirin has a nearly immediate effect; when oral pretreatment is chosen, pretreatment with both aspirin and clopidogrel should preferably include loading with 300 mg to reduce initial bleeding risk. For intraprocedural unfractionated heparin (UFH), doses as low as 30–50 IU/kg have been shown effective for preventing ischaemic PCI complications and should be preferred to limit bleeding risk.

### Cangrelor (Kengreal) [^115zmZes]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 CHAMPION PHOENIX Trial

The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial was intended to test whether faster platelet inhibition with cangrelor at the time of PCI would reduce the rate of periprocedural thrombotic events compared to a drug with a slower antiplatelet effect, clopidogrel, given at about the time of PCI. It was a randomized, double-blind study in which patients with coronary artery disease (stable angina, UA/NSTEMI, STEMI) requiring PCI and receiving standard therapy including aspirin and heparin or bivalirudin were randomized 1:1 to KENGREAL (n = 5472) or to clopidogrel 300 or 600 mg (n = 5470). Patients who had already taken an oral P2Y12platelet inhibitor were not eligible to enroll. Patients administered glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) or for whom GPI use was planned were also not eligible to enroll. PHOENIX was thus a study of people undergoing PCI who had not been previously treated with anti-platelet therapy other than aspirin.

The primary outcome measure was the first occurrence of any one of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization (IDR), and stent thrombosis (ST) within 48 hours after randomization.

KENGREAL was administered as 30 mcg/kg bolus followed by 4 mcg/kg/min infusion for 2 to 4 hours. Clopidogrel 600 mg was administered immediately at the end of the KENGREAL infusion in patients randomized to KENGREAL. Clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg was administered shortly before PCI or shortly afterward, in patients randomized to clopidogrel.

### One-month dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with zotarolimus-eluting stents in high-bleeding-risk patients [^112ea29d]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Procedures

Before the PCI procedure, all patients received a loading dose of aspirin (250–500 mg), and P2Y 12 inhibitor pretreatment was administered according to institutional standard practice. DAPT use was mandatory for 1-month post-index procedure or following a staged procedure (performed within 1 month of the initial procedure), if indicated. Requirements for DAPT included 75 to 100 mg aspirin daily and the standard daily dose of a P2Y 12 inhibitor according to individual product labeling, with 75 mg clopidogrel as the preferred agent. Patients discontinued either aspirin or the P2Y 12 inhibitor at 1 month and thereafter were continued on SAPT. Whether to discontinue aspirin or the P2Y 12 inhibitor was according to investigator discretion. Patients treated with oral anticoagulants (OACs) were permitted to receive SAPT plus OAC from the date of the index procedure onward.

Patients were followed post-procedure at 1 month by clinic visit and then at 2 and 6 months and 1 year by telephone/clinic visit with planned follow-up through 2 years.

### Rationale and design of the OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION trial: a prospective randomized multi-center clinical trial comparing different fibrinolysis-transfer percutaneous coronary intervention strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1126SsfN]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Controversially, when compared with PPCI, ASSENT‐4 PCI (primary versus Tenecteplase‐facilitated PCI in patients with STEMI) and FINESSE (facilitated intervention with enhanced reperfusion speed to stop events) trial showed that facilitated PCI did not improve the endpoint events (death, congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and recurrent myocardial infarction) of STEMI patients, and increase bleeding complications. 28, 29 Due to the associated increased bleeding risk, very early catheterization after administration of fibrinolytic therapy is not routinely recommended unless for patients with evidence of failed fibrinolysis when rescue PCI would be appropriate. However, suboptimum antithrombotic co‐therapy during reperfusion (not given an infusion of heparin after a single intravenous bolus and not routinely given clopidogrel) in the test arm of ASSENT‐4 PCI trial, and additional time delay required for administration of lytic agent, planned use of GPI in all patients, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone in FINESSE trial could in part explain the worse clinical outcome noted in these patients. In addition, most patients (45% in ASSENT‐4 PCI and 60% in FINESSE trial) were enrolled in PCI hospitals, which may lead to the observed results that cannot be generalizable to non‐PCI centers with long delays for transfer patients for PCI.

Since the publication of these trials, significant advances have occurred in pharmacological therapy and PCI technology. Therefore, in patients with STEMI presenting in non‐PCI centers and with anticipated PPCI delay, fibrinolysis followed by very early angiography (< 2 to 3 hours) may be a feasible strategy according to current practice. Moreover, many studies demonstrated that approximately 50% of the successful fibrinolysis patients of standard pharmacoinvasive strategy did not achieve optimal perfusion (TIMI flow grade 3), 6, 7, 8, 23, 26, 30 not to mention patients of failed fibrinolysis, and very early revascularization is of great clinical significance for these suboptimal perfusion patients, whom might potentially benefit from the reduced‐dose facilitated PCI strategy.

The antithrombotic regimen in OPTIMAL‐REPERFUSION includes both aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin on top of rhPro‐UK. This antithrombotic regimen is more aggressive than the regimen used in the test arm of the ASSENT‐4 PCI trial, which noted more ischemic complications than PPCI group. Moreover, the reduced‐dose rhPro‐UK in the test arm of OPTIMAL‐REPERFUSION trial, combined with routine use of radial‐artery access and bailout use of GPI, aims to reduce bleeding risk.

Randomization, Procedures, and Outcomes

The patients were randomized by a 24‐hour central automated voice response system. We used permuted block randomization stratified by center. 14, 15, 16 A statistician set up a computer‐generated random allocation sequence for the data safety and monitoring board. For the clopidogrel dose allocation, patients, those doing the interventions, those evaluating events, and those analyzing the data were masked to group assignment. The aspirin dose allocation was open label, with blinded adjudication of outcomes.

After randomization and before the cardiac catheterization, the patients, who were randomly allocated to double‐dose clopidogrel, received a 600‐mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 150 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Those assigned to standard‐dose clopidogrel received a 300‐mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Subsequently, on days 8 to 30, both groups received 75 mg once daily. 14, 15, 16

All participants received a loading dose of aspirin (≥ 300 mg) on day 1. On days 2 to 30, patients randomly allocated low‐dose aspirin received 75 to 100 mg daily, whereas those allocated high‐dose aspirin received 300 to 325 mg daily. We strongly discouraged the administration of vitamin K antagonists concurrently with the study drugs during the first 7 days. The other therapies, including anticoagulants, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, and the applied stents, were left to the discretion of the treating physician.

Our primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke from randomization to day 30. 14, 15, 16 Secondary outcomes included the primary outcome plus recurrent ischemia, individual components of the composite outcomes, and stent thrombosis as defined by the academic research consortium. 14, 15, 16 The applied definitions of outcome events have been described elsewhere. 14 A central committee, blinded for the treatment allocation, adjudicated all efficacy outcomes, including recurrent ischemia, stent thrombosis, and bleeding events.

### Antithrombotic therapy: triple therapy or triple threat? [^112t4Vfk]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy plays an essential role in the management of some of the most common and morbid medical conditions. Triple oral antithrombotic therapy (TOAT) is defined as the administration of both therapeutic oral anticoagulation (OAC) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to patients with indications for both treatments. The current societal guidelines regarding TOAT are derived from observational studies and some trials of the use of warfarin in addition to antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. The general apprehension to administer TOAT is due to the heightened concern for bleeding, rendering warfarin's pharmacokinetic properties concerning. Newer anticoagulant agents may serve as appealing alternatives, and further investigations are warranted. The results of the recent trials that have studied the use of these agents in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome offer some useful applications to TOAT. Ultimately, selecting the most favorable antithrombotic strategy is going to involve weighing the risks and benefits for each patient.

### Pharmacology before, during and after percutaneous coronary intervention [^113jKWYo]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The failure of pretreatment with oral P2Y12 inhibitors in NSTE-ACS was surprising given the central role of platelets in atherothrombotic disease and raises questions about whether the mode of delivery — oral versus parenteral — could be important.

The evidence for GPI's pre-dates use of routine oral dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and early invasive treatment. While early trials demonstrated a reduction in ischaemic events (largely reduction in myocardial infarction (MI)) in favour of GPI in combination with unfractionated heparin (UFH) compared with UFH alone, a consistent major bleeding risk was seen. Overall, there is no evidence for benefit of routine upstream GPI in patients scheduled for PCI and receiving DAPT treatment. With ticagrelor or prasugrel, randomised data with GPI use are limited; therefore, use of these agents for pretreatment is not recommended. Cangrelor also lacks evidence in the presence of prasugrel or ticagrelor.

In summary, aspirin (loading and maintenance) carries a IA recommendation for pretreatment in NSTE-ACS with ticragelor (180 mg) added as soon as the coronary anatomy is established (IIbC). If ticagrelor is unavailable, then clopidogrel 600 mg can be given but prasugrel is not recommended (IIIA). The use of cangrelor in P2Y12-naïve patients unable to take oral medication carries a IIbA recommendation. If the wait for coronary angiography is longer (> 24 hours), antiplatelet pretreatment should be considered.

With respect to anticoagulants, the OASIS-5 trial showed equivalence of fondaparinux (2.5 mg od subcutaneously) to heparin in reducing composite events but with a reduced risk of bleeding. As a result, fondaparinux carries a class IA recommendation for pretreatment of NSTE-ACS but patients should receive UFH during PCI. Where fondaparinux is not available, then enoxaparin (1 mg/kg two times a day, subcutaneously) is preferred (class IB).

### An aspirin-free versus dual antiplatelet strategy for coronary stenting: STOPDAPT-3 randomized trial [^111Qd5ee]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bleeding rates on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) within 1 month after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain high in clinical practice, particularly in patients with acute coronary syndrome or high bleeding risk. Aspirin-free strategy might result in lower bleeding early after PCI without increasing cardiovascular events, but its efficacy and safety have not yet been proven in randomized trials.

Methods

We randomly assigned 6002 patients with acute coronary syndrome or high bleeding risk just before PCI either to prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) monotherapy or to DAPT with aspirin (81–100 mg/day) and prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) after loading of 20 mg of prasugrel in both groups. The coprimary end points were major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5) for superiority and cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis, or ischemic stroke) for noninferiority with a relative 50% margin.

Results

The full analysis set population consisted of 5966 patients (no-aspirin group, 2984 patients; DAPT group, 2982 patients; age, 71.6 ± 11.7 years; men, 76.6%; acute coronary syndrome, 75.0%). Within 7 days before randomization, aspirin alone, aspirin with P2Y12 inhibitor, oral anticoagulants, and intravenous heparin infusion were given in 21.3%, 6.4%, 8.9%, and 24.5%, respectively. Adherence to the protocol-specified antiplatelet therapy was 88% in both groups at 1 month. At 1 month, the no-aspirin group was not superior to the DAPT group for the coprimary bleeding end point (4.47% and 4.71%; hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.75–1.20]; P superiority = 0.66). The no-aspirin group was noninferior to the DAPT group for the coprimary cardiovascular end point (4.12% and 3.69%; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.87–1.45]; P non inferiority = 0.01). There was no difference in net adverse clinical outcomes and each component of coprimary cardiovascular end point. There was an excess of any unplanned coronary revascularization (1.05% and 0.57%; hazard ratio, 1.83 [95%CI, 1.01–3.30]) and subacute definite or probable stent thrombosis (0.58% and 0.17%; hazard ratio, 3.40 [95% CI, 1.26–9.23]) in the no-aspirin group compared with the DAPT group.

Conclusions

The aspirin-free strategy using low-dose prasugrel compared with the DAPT strategy failed to attest superiority for major bleeding within 1 month after PCI but was noninferior for cardiovascular events within 1 month after PCI. However, the aspirin-free strategy was associated with a signal suggesting an excess of coronary events.

### Combining antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy (triple therapy): what are the risks and benefits? [^112dudow]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients with mechanical heart valves and many patients with atrial fibrillation will require long-term anticoagulation therapy. For patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, only warfarin is indicated. However, for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for embolic stroke, one of the newer antithrombotic medications, such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban, also can be used. Patients with indications for antithrombotic therapy often will have coexisting vascular disease, such as coronary artery disease, requiring concomitant antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone or more commonly with a dual antiplatelet regimen, aspirin and clopidogrel, or prasugrel or ticagrelor. The risks and benefits of this approach are still not well defined, and current guidelines have included recommendations based primarily on expert opinion.

### Personalizing antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel [^112WG6cb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is the accepted standard for prevention of ischemic complications after percutaneous coronary intervention and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). There is substantial interindividual variability in antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Various clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity incur an increased risk for ischemic events. In recent years, several clinical and demographic variables as well as multiple genetic factors contributing to the variability in antiplatelet response to clopidogrel have been identified. We discuss strategies based on platelet function testing or genotyping for improvement of antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel and thereby clinical outcome.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents in acute coronary syndromes: what is the current status and what does the future hold? [^115oxztc]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality and morbidity in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), caused principally by plaque erosion or rupture leading to thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia, have been reduced by a combination of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) and early revascularization. Aspirin is the foundation antiplatelet agent. New P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) have clear benefits compared with clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy, and cangrelor or vorapaxar, a thrombin receptor inhibitor, may be of value in specific settings. Anticoagulation uses 1 of 4 choices: bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux. Moreover, some patients (such as those who have chronic atrial fibrillation) require triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, plus an anticoagulant, frequently a vitamin K antagonist. New oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists in atrial fibrillation and led to fewer bleeding complications. Finally, the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and low-dose rivaroxaban has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency (but not the Food and Drug Administration) for secondary prevention after ACS. Several strategies have been developed to balance the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy against the risk of bleeding complications, for example, radial access in coronary angiography or restricted use of combination therapy, and others are under investigation, such as discontinuation of aspirin. This overview summarizes the current status of antithrombotic therapy in ACS and describes strategies currently explored to optimize its benefit/risk ratio.

### Drug insight: antithrombotic therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with an indication for anticoagulation [^112nhKb5]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is standard care following revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention with stent insertion. This so-called dual therapy is recommended for up to 4 weeks after intervention for bare-metal stents and for 6–12 months after intervention for drug-eluting stents. Although it is estimated that 5% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention require long-term anticoagulation because of an underlying chronic medical condition, continuing treatment with triple therapy (warfarin, aspirin and clopidogrel) increases the risk of bleeding. In most patients triple antithrombotic therapy seems justified for a short period of time. In some patients, however, a more considered judgment based on absolute need for triple therapy, risk of bleeding and risk of stent thrombosis is required, but the optimum antithrombotic treatment for these patients who require long-term anticoagulation has not been defined. This Review summarizes the existing literature concerning antithrombotic therapy and makes recommendations for initiation and duration of triple therapy in the small proportion of patients already receiving anticoagulant therapy who require percutaneous coronary intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical scenario 3 — patient with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) summarizes that the standard therapy for acute VTE is anticoagulation, and current guidelines give preference to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) over a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for non-cancer-associated VTE while low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a DOAC (rather than a VKA) are recommended for cancer-associated VTE. Venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor can generally be treated for 3 months, whereas unprovoked VTE may be treated indefinitely, and in patients on indefinite anticoagulation reduced-intensity options include rivaroxaban 10 mg daily and apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. In patients with unprovoked VTE who stop anticoagulation after a minimum of 3 months, aspirin is an option for secondary prevention, although it is not as effective as anticoagulation, and in patients receiving PCI while on an OAC for VTE, triple therapy is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.

### Ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^113iLUWz]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — pretreatment specifies that patients considered for ad hoc PCI should be administered aspirin before diagnostic catheterization; pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors hours to days before PCI is ideal, although they can also be administered at the time of PCI, particularly if they are among those that act rapidly; adequate hydration with normal saline should be provided before diagnostic catheterization if ad hoc PCI is to be considered, and lack of adequate hydration may be a relative contraindication to ad hoc PCI.

Regarding specific circumstances for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to patients requiring cardiac surgery, ASH 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering one of the following if delaying surgery is not feasible:

- intraoperative anticoagulation with bivalirudin

- intraoperative heparin after treatment with preoperative and/or intraoperative plasma exchange

- intraoperative heparin in combination with a potent antiplatelet agent (such as prostacyclin analog or tirofiban).

Pre-procedure Anticoagulation Recommendations

The management of patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy undergoing image-guided interventions is complex and evolving. In clinical practice, there is a lot of variation and no clear consensus exists, mainly due to the lack of evidence-based data. For managing anticoagulation in patients undergoing IR procedures, the procedures are stratified according to the inherent "bleeding risk" (Table 1). In addition, the type of medication taken by the patient is considered, resulting in a recommendation (Table 2). Each IR clinic should have an institutional anticoagulation guideline.

Proposed classification of IR procedures according to the bleeding risk

Table 2
Example recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and platelet-aggregation blocker therapy before an IR procedure

In general, the risk from secondary bleeding must be weighed against the risk of complications due to the cessation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication. The risks need to be discussed between a relevant physician and the treating radiologist.

For all procedures, regardless of the risk of bleeding, the patient's platelet count should be at least 50 × 10 9 /L. For procedures with low bleeding risk, the INR should be corrected if it is greater than 2. For procedures that have a moderate or high risk of bleeding, the INR should be corrected if it is greater than 1.5. In case of inability or insufficient time to reverse the patient's anticoagulation status, a reversal agent can be administered; these include vitamin K for warfarin; protamine sulphate for heparin; fresh frozen plasma or platelet transfusion, etc. Some patients receiving long-term anticoagulation may require "bridging" anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin.

Critical steps during the pre-procedure consultation include the initial patient assessment, a directed physical examination, the review of the patient's previous imaging studies and laboratory testing and obtaining written informed consent. Consultations are facilitated by the availability of dedicated institutional guidelines, e.g. for anticoagulation management.

Peri- and Post-procedural Care

After evaluation, indication and pre-procedural planning, structured peri- and post-procedural care is needed. Typical considerations for peri-and post-interventional care include the following:

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

for any TIMI grade bleeding were low. Using a worst-case approach that combined 2 independent bleeding evaluations, use of enoxaparin was associated with 1 additional TIMI major bleeding episode for each 200 patients treated. analysis for TIMI major bleeding revealed an increased frequency of approximately 1 in 200 associated with use of enoxaparin. Further breakdown of major. bleeding in the as treated population revealed no difference in investigator-reported rates of major bleeding whereas there was a significant. a significant increase in reports of "any bleed" driven primarily by investigator-identified minor bleeding episodes. Exposure from one form of pretreatment heparin to another at randomization was not associated with increased risk of bleeding.

Exposure to a different form of heparin after randomization was more common for patients receiving enoxaparin than those receiving unfractionated. heparin. Among the patients initially receiving enoxaparin, overall major or minor bleeding occurred in 3. 0% of patients who received enoxaparin alone compared with
3. 3% for those who were crossed over. full and rapid reversal of anticoagulation. We observed a 1 in 200 increased risk for major bleeding with enoxaparin. The clinical relevance of this finding is low and is further diminished by the absence of any associated increase in transfusion. rates. Because it is easier to use and modestly reduces recurrent ischemic events without an increase in the need for blood products, enoxaparin compares favorably with unfractionated heparin in patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS who are receiving tirofiban and aspirin.

### Effect of aspirin vs enoxaparin on symptomatic venous… [^115Zo3oE]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning In patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, aspirin compared with enoxaparin resulted in a significantly higher rate of symptomatic VTE, including below-knee VTE. Importance There remains a lack of randomized trials investigating aspirin monotherapy for symptomatic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, aspirin compared with enoxaparin resulted in a significantly higher rate of symptomatic VTE within 90 days, defined as below- or above-knee DVT or pulmonary embolism. These findings may be informed by a cost-effectiveness analysis.

The CRISTAL randomized trial was a registry-nested study that used a cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority design to assess the effects of aspirin compared with low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent symptomatic VTE in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. This randomized trial aimed to determine if aspirin monotherapy was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing symptomatic VTE within 90 days for patients undergoing primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Patients in the aspirin group received aspirin, 100 mg/d, orally for 35 days after hip arthroplasty and for 14 days after knee arthroplasty, beginning within 24 hours postoperatively. Patients in the enoxaparin group received enoxaparin, 40 mg/d, subcutaneously for the same time periods, with the dose reduced to 20 mg for patients weighing less than 50 kg and for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2.

Among patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, aspirin compared with enoxaparin resulted in a significantly higher rate of symptomatic VTE within 90 days, defined as below- or above-knee DVT or pulmonary embolism. These findings may be informed by a cost-effectiveness analysis. Corresponding Author: Verinder S.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes… [^112PU8NC]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin has been used medicinally since antiquity. Its antithrombotic action is due to irreversible blockade of the formation of thromboxane A2, a potent mediator of platelet aggregation. The inhibitory effects of aspirin on platelet aggregation are rapid, with maximal effects achieved within 15 to 30 minutes of oral administration of a dose as low as 81 mg.
1. However, the conventional therapy arm did not include aspirin or heparin, and most of the reduction in events with ticlopidine therapy occurred not during the initial hospitalization but in the months after discharge. The relatively short onset of action provided by a loading dose of clopidogrel, the once-daily dosing schedule, and the moderate degree of platelet inhibition achieved might make this agent a possible alternate therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes who have true aspirin allergies.

The role of unfractionated heparin in the treatment of MI in the modern era is still not well resolved. Individual studies of heparin in the prethrombolytic era produced inconsistent results. 28 An overview of these studies of heparin therapy for acute MI found that patients who were not treated with aspirin had an 18% reduction in reinfarction and a 23% reduction in death; however, in those patients who were also treated with aspirin, the reductions were on the order of only 5% to 10%.
29. The role of adjuvant heparin therapy in patients with acute MI who are treated with thrombolytic therapy and aspirin is undergoing reevaluation. The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico 6 and ISIS-330 studies included arms in which patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, most of whom presented with ST-segment elevation, were randomized to adjunctive subcutaneous heparin sodium therapy or no heparin therapy.

Although in patients treated with tissue plasminogen-activator, intravenous heparin does not appear to improve early vessel patency when assessed angiographically 90 minutes after administration of the thrombolytic agent, it may have a role in maintaining vessel patency in the 1 to 4 days after tPA administration. 28 An overview of randomized trials involving intravenous heparin therapy, however, did not detect any significant effects of heparin therapy on rates or recurrent ischemia, reinfarction, or mortality. 33.
