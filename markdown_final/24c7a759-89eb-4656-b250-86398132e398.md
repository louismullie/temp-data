## Question

Common Contaminants of Cranioplasties

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common contaminants of cranioplasties, including organisms, sources, and implications for infection risk and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the microbiology and which organisms are most frequently isolated. Then, I should verify the sources of contamination and how they map to the organisms. Next, I will examine the clinical significance of these contaminants, including whether they predict infection and how biofilm biology affects outcomes. After that, I should review risk modifiers such as timing, materials, and patient factors. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications for prophylaxis, diagnostics, and salvage strategies, and close with a concise summary of the contaminant profile and its clinical relevance.

> Let me first confirm the predominant organisms identified as contaminants in cranioplasty contexts. Multiple series consistently show that skin flora dominate: Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common, with C. acnes frequently prominent in cranial procedures, often representing low-virulence contamination rather than overt infection at the time of sampling [^116E5YhV] [^114AdT3F] [^114QBFQN].

> Wait, let me verify the relative proportions and the distinction between contamination and true infection. In a large prospective cohort of bone flaps cultured at cranioplasty, 59.5% were culture-positive, with 76–85% of isolates being C. acnes or CoNS, yet these swabs had poor predictive value for subsequent SSI, underscoring that many are contaminants rather than harbingers of infection; by contrast, when true SSI occurred, MSSA was the most common pathogen in about 38% of cases, suggesting a shift from low-virulence skin flora to more aggressive organisms in clinically significant infections [^114AdT3F]. I should also note that in a separate series of cranial SSIs, C. acnes was overrepresented relative to spine infections, reinforcing its role as a head-and-neck skin commensal contaminant in this setting [^114QBFQN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what these "contaminants" mean clinically. I need to check whether reimplanting culture-positive bone flaps increases infection risk. In a prospective cohort, 50% of bone flaps were contaminated, but reimplanting culture-positive flaps did not increase SSI risk after the initial craniotomy or subsequent cranioplasty, suggesting that routine skin flora contamination alone is not a reliable predictor of infection and that meticulous surgical technique may mitigate risk [^116E5YhV]. Let me reconsider the implication: this supports the concept that contamination is common, but clinical infection is driven by inoculum, local tissue factors, and host defenses rather than the mere presence of low-virulence organisms on the flap [^116E5YhV].

> Next, I should review the sources of contamination to ensure the microbiology aligns with expected reservoirs. The scalp and hair-bearing skin are the primary reservoirs, with endogenous flora from the head and neck accounting for the majority of cranial SSIs; environmental gram-negative organisms are less common but can appear, particularly with breaches in asepsis, prolonged procedures, or compromised tissue planes [^111d2xGe] [^114QBFQN]. I need to ensure I also acknowledge that some "contaminants" may reflect low-grade biofilm-associated processes on implants or devitalized bone, which can persist subclinically and complicate interpretation of cultures [^1112GCrx].

> I will now examine the clinical significance and the biofilm paradigm, because this affects both diagnosis and treatment. Many low-virulence organisms, especially C. acnes and CoNS, can participate in biofilm formation on implants or avascular bone, rendering them relatively protected from host immunity and antibiotics; this helps explain why positive cultures for these organisms may not correlate with acute infection but may still represent a risk for indolent or delayed infections, particularly when local conditions deteriorate or when more virulent organisms supervene [^1112GCrx] [^114B1Ywv]. But wait, what if the "contaminant" is actually driving pathology? Preliminary data suggest C. acnes may contribute to aseptic bone resorption of autologous flaps, hinting that some "contaminants" can participate in low-grade pathogenic processes even without classic SSI signs [^113qLpuw].

> Let me think about risk modifiers that convert contamination into infection, because this guides prevention. Early cranioplasty within 14 days of craniectomy significantly increases infection risk, likely due to immature wound healing and higher bacterial burden dynamics; conversely, allowing at least 14 days reduces infection risk, though timing must be balanced against other complications like hydrocephalus and seizures [^116q6eZj] [^112jVCyY]. I should double-check material-related signals: prosthetic implants carry higher SSI risk than autologous bone in several series, and large defects, prior same-side surgery, diabetes, and CSF leaks further amplify risk, reinforcing that host and wound factors often outweigh the contaminant profile in determining outcomes [^113CQbVo] [^114BhAZZ] [^112oFay3].

> Next, I should review perioperative strategies that reduce conversion of contamination to infection. Standard prophylaxis with a single pre-incision dose of cefazolin is recommended for cranial surgery, with vancomycin added in MRSA-colonized patients or high-MRSA-prevalence settings; dual therapy may be considered in select institutions, though evidence is mixed and should be individualized [^113cA5Df] [^111UywJH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought clindamycin was a reasonable alternative for penicillin allergy, but recent data associate clindamycin prophylaxis with increased SSI risk in clean craniotomy, so I should correct that and favor cefazolin even in many labeled penicillin-allergic patients after appropriate allergy verification when feasible [^115pe1Gd]. I need to ensure I also emphasize meticulous skin antisepsis, hair management, and aseptic technique, as these modifiable factors likely have greater impact than the mere presence of low-virulence contaminants on the flap [^111d2xGe] [^116E5YhV].

> I should confirm the diagnostic utility of routine bone flap cultures, because this affects cost and decision-making. Routine intraoperative bone flap swabs at cranioplasty have poor sensitivity and specificity for predicting subsequent SSI, and eliminating this low-value practice reduces workload without compromising care; similarly, routine cultures of noninfected hardware at removal are discouraged in other neurosurgical devices due to frequent contamination and limited actionability [^114AdT3F] [^111D537H]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not apply when there is clinical infection; in suspected infection, targeted cultures remain appropriate, but screening cultures without clinical correlates should be avoided [^notfound].

> Let me consider salvage strategies when infection occurs, because this influences how we view "contaminated" implants. Immediate titanium cranioplasty at the time of debridement for postcraniotomy infection has been reported with low reinfection rates in selected patients, suggesting that with aggressive debridement and appropriate antibiotics, implant salvage can be safe in specific contexts, though careful patient selection is essential [^114wy6Uz] [^1162eqhr]. I should also review conservative strategies for select implant infections, such as hydroxyapatite devices with intact dura and well-vascularized scalp, where prolonged biofilm-active antibiotics and local care may obviate explantation in a minority of cases, though this remains exception rather than rule [^116G4ceM].

> Synthesis-wise, I need to ensure the final message is precise. The most common contaminants of cranioplasties are skin flora — Cutibacterium acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus — with C. acnes and CoNS frequently isolated on bone flaps but often representing low-virulence contamination that does not predict SSI; true infections more often involve S. aureus and occasionally gram-negative organisms, particularly when host or wound factors are unfavorable [^114AdT3F] [^114QBFQN] [^116ZKzDC]. Contamination is common, but clinical infection risk is shaped by timing, tissue quality, implant type, prior operations, and adherence to infection-prevention bundles; therefore, prevention should focus on optimizing antisepsis, timing, glycemic control, and perioperative prophylaxis rather than discarding culture-positive but clinically uninfected flaps or routinely culturing noninfected hardware [^116E5YhV] [^111d2xGe] [^113cA5Df].

---

The most common contaminants of cranioplasties are **skin flora** — Cutibacterium acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci (especially Staphylococcus epidermidis), and Staphylococcus aureus — which account for the majority of positive cultures and infections [^116E5YhV] [^114AdT3F] [^114QBFQN]. Gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter species are less frequent but more often associated with **healthcare exposure, prior infection, or immunocompromise** [^113cA5Df]. Environmental fungi (e.g. Aspergillus, Candida) are rare but can occur in immunocompromised patients or with contaminated materials [^112oFErR] [^111dwcBj]. Contamination arises from intraoperative exposure, storage of autologous bone, or implant handling; **strict aseptic technique, appropriate timing, and perioperative antibiotics reduce infection risk** [^111d2xGe] [^113cA5Df] [^112jVCyY].

---

## Common bacterial contaminants

### Skin flora

- **Cutibacterium acnes**: formerly Propionibacterium acnes; anaerobic, slow-growing, and frequently isolated from bone flaps and cranioplasty sites; associated with low-grade, indolent infections and biofilm formation [^116E5YhV] [^113qLpuw].

- **Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)**: Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common; these organisms are frequent contaminants but can cause significant infections, particularly on foreign materials [^115GgCZs] [^113QeotY].

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains are major pathogens; MRSA is associated with more severe infections and higher morbidity [^116ZKzDC].

---

### Gram-negative rods

- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: associated with healthcare exposure, prior infection, or immunocompromised states; often resistant to multiple antibiotics [^notfound].

- **Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species**: less common but significant, particularly in patients with prolonged hospitalization or prior antibiotic exposure [^notfound].

---

## Fungal contaminants

Fungal contamination is rare but can occur, particularly in **immunocompromised patients** or with contaminated materials. Candida species are the most common, typically in immunocompromised hosts or with prolonged antibiotic exposure [^112oFErR]. Aspergillus species are rare but reported, particularly in immunocompromised patients or with contaminated materials [^112oFErR].

---

## Sources of contamination

Contamination of cranioplasty materials can occur at **multiple stages**:

| **Source** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Intraoperative contamination | Exposure to skin flora during surgical procedures; improper sterile technique; inadequate skin preparation [^111d2xGe] [^116E5YhV] |
| Storage of autologous bone flaps | Improper storage or handling of cryopreserved bone flaps can introduce contamination [^notfound] |
| Implant handling | Contamination during handling or preparation of synthetic implants (PMMA, titanium, PEEK) [^112dg9RP] |
| Environmental factors | Operating room air quality; contaminated surgical instruments; healthcare-associated exposure [^112YYqst] |

---

## Clinical significance of contamination

Contamination does not always lead to clinical infection; however, certain factors increase the risk of **infection**:

- **Implant material**: alloplastic materials (PMMA, titanium, PEEK) have higher infection rates compared to autologous bone flaps [^113CQbVo].

- **Patient factors**: immunocompromised state, diabetes, prolonged hospitalization, and prior infections increase infection risk [^113CQbVo] [^112oFay3] [^113ckgMq] [^1142jtNG].

- **Surgical factors**: prolonged operative time, multiple surgeries, and early cranioplasty (< 14 days) are associated with higher infection rates [^116q6eZj] [^113Dxo53] [^113CQbVo].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention of contamination and infection includes:

- **Perioperative antibiotics**: single dose of cefazolin within 60 minutes before incision; vancomycin for MRSA colonization or high institutional MRSA prevalence [^113cA5Df] [^111UywJH].

- **Sterile technique**: rigorous adherence to sterile technique, proper skin preparation, and minimizing intraoperative exposure [^111d2xGe] [^114QBFQN].

- **Implant handling**: meticulous handling and preparation of implants; antibiotic-impregnated materials may reduce infection risk [^112dg9RP] [^1159N3oS].

- **Timing of cranioplasty**: delaying cranioplasty beyond 14 days after initial craniectomy significantly reduces infection risk [^116q6eZj] [^112jVCyY].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Contamination and subsequent infection can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Infection**: most common complication, often necessitating implant removal and prolonged antibiotic therapy [^1135XbRb] [^113wsuam].

- **Bone flap resorption**: particularly associated with autologous bone flaps and low-grade infections (e.g. Cutibacterium acnes) [^113qLpuw] [^116SxPFK].

- **Implant exposure and extrusion**: often due to infection, poor soft tissue coverage, or mechanical factors [^113JuMi4] [^117FjsUa].

- **Neurological complications**: seizures, hydrocephalus, and neurological deficits may occur, particularly in the setting of infection or implant failure [^117Nu24e] [^112jVCyY].

---

The most common contaminants of cranioplasties are **skin flora** (Cutibacterium acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus), with Gram-negative rods and fungi less frequent but clinically significant in select patients. Contamination can occur intraoperatively, during storage of autologous bone, or through implant handling. Effective prevention strategies — including perioperative antibiotics, sterile technique, and appropriate timing of cranioplasty — are essential to minimize infection risk and associated complications.

### Clinical significance of positive cranial bone flap cultures and associated risk of surgical site infection after craniotomies or craniectomies [^116E5YhV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Object

The risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after craniotomies or craniectomies in patients in whom contaminated bone flaps have been reimplanted has not been determined. The objectives of this study were to identify the prevalence of bone flaps with positive cultures — especially those contaminated with Propionibacterium acnes — to assess the risk of SSI after reimplanting (either during the initial operation or subsequently) bone flaps with positive cultures, and to identify risk factors for SSI following the initial craniotomies or craniectomies.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective review of cases in which patients underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between January and October 2007 in the neurosurgery department at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. They also reviewed processes and procedures and did pulsed field gel electrophoresis of P. acnes isolates to look for a common source of contamination. They then conducted a prospective cohort study that included all patients who underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between November 2007 and November 2008 and met the study criteria. For the cohort study, the authors obtained cultures from each patient's bone flap during the craniotomy/craniectomy procedures. Data about potential risk factors were collected by circulating nurses during the procedures or by a research assistant who reviewed medical records after the procedures. An infection preventionist independently identified SSIs through routine surveillance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between SSI and potential risk factors.

Results

The retrospective review did not identify specific breaks in aseptic technique or a common source of P. acnes. Three hundred seventy-three patients underwent 393 craniotomy/craniectomy procedures during the cohort study period, of which 377 procedures met the study criteria. Fifty percent of the bone flaps were contaminated by microorganisms, primarily skin flora such as P. acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reimplanting bone flaps that had positive culture results did not increase the risk of infection after the initial craniotomy/craniectomy procedures and the subsequent cranioplasty procedures (p = 0.80). Allowing the skin antiseptic to dry before the procedures (p = 0.04, OR 0.26) was associated with lower risk of SSIs. Female sex (p = 0.02, OR = 3.49) was associated with an increased risk of SSIs; Gliadel wafer implants (p = 0.001, OR = 8.38) were associated with an increased risk of SSIs after procedures to treat tumors.

Conclusions

Operative factors such as the way the skin is prepared before the incision rather than the skin flora contaminants on the bone flaps may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSIs after craniotomy/craniectomy. Gliadel wafers significantly increased the risk of SSI after procedures to treat tumors.

### Postoperative wound care protocol prevents surgical site infection after craniotomy [^111d2xGe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 50,000 craniotomy procedures are performed annually in the United States. Surgical site infections (SSIs) after craniotomy cause substantial morbidity and mortality, often requiring extended hospital stays and additional operations. –

Approximately 70% to 95% of SSIs are caused by endogenous flora colonizing the head, neck, and shoulder area. Most SSI prevention strategies involve preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, incisional skin antisepsis, appropriate hair removal, antibiotic prophylaxis, intraoperative vancomycin powder and irrigation solution, various closure methods and/or materials, and managing postoperative hyperglycemia. – Some also include screening for and decolonizing Staphylococcus aureus carriers.

In contrast to preoperative and perioperative SSI prevention guidance, postoperative craniotomy SSI prevention efforts have not been standardized. Evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a specific postoperative wound care protocol. Although various publications for postoperative wound management after craniotomy have included options for advanced dressingsand prophylactic topical antibiotic application to the incision, studies focusing on care for postoperative incisional wounds and adjacent hair are lacking.

Post-craniotomy incisional care is complicated by local wound factors, including the high vascularity of the face and scalp (which contributes to clot formation), the high microbial colonization of the sebaceous scalp and head, and the presence of hair, as some neurosurgeons prefer to minimize hair clipping along the incision line. Hair not only causes physical contamination of the incision, but it raises questions about how to keep the area clean and keep adhesive dressings in place.

The objectives of this study were to design an effective postoperative wound care protocol for cleaning craniotomy incisions as well as the surrounding hair, and to evaluate the impact on SSI.

### Infection rates following custom-made cranioplasty using heterologous materials: insights from a systematic review on 3260 patients with a focus on follow-up length [^1135XbRb]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Custom-made cranioplasty can be performed using various heterologous materials, each associated with a distinct complication profile. This systematic review focuses on infections, the most common complication following cranioplasty.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the available literature was conducted to identify infection and explantation rates associated with materials used in custom-made heterologous cranioplasty. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases yielded 3437 articles. After screening, 43 articles met the inclusion criteria and data on study parameters, patient populations, and infection characteristics were extracted.

Results

Forty-three articles were selected and included in this review, analyzing a total of 3260 implanted cranioplasties, divided by material as follows: 931 titanium, 1227 hydroxyapatite, 680 PMMA, 379 PEEK, and 143 composites. The cumulative infection and explantation rates were: 8.2% and 3.7% for titanium, 6.7% and 5.3% for hydroxyapatite, 14.9% and 6.1% for PMMA, 11.1% and 3.8% for PEEK, and 4.2% and 6.2% for composites. Importantly, the follow-up duration varied significantly among materials. Studies involving titanium and composites had the shortest follow-up, potentially underestimating infection rates, while studies on PMMA and hydroxyapatite had the longest follow-up, providing more robust estimates.

Conclusions

This review confirms general trends in infection rates among cranioplasty materials and emphasizes the critical role of follow-up duration in interpreting complication rate. Differences in study design and reporting standards limit direct comparison between materials. Future research should adopt standardized follow-up thresholds and uniform outcome definitions to enable reliable cross-material comparisons.

### Cranioplasty with custom-made titanium plates – 14 years experience [^114BhAZZ]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on which material is best suited for repair of cranial defects.

Objective

To investigate the outcomes following custom-made titanium cranioplasty.

Methods

The medical records for all patients who had titanium cranioplasty at 2 major neurosurgical centers in Western Australia were retrieved and analyzed for this retrospective cohort study.

Results

Altogether, 127 custom-made titanium cranioplasties on 113 patients were included. Two patients had 3 titanium cranioplasties and 10 patients had 2. Infected bone flap (n = 61, 54%), either from previous craniotomy or autologous cranioplasty, and contaminated bone flap (n = 16, 14%) from the initial injury were the main reasons for requiring titanium cranioplasty. Complications attributed to titanium cranioplasty were common (n = 33, 29%), with infection being the most frequent complication (n = 18 patients, 16%). Complications were, on average, associated with an extra 7 days of hospital stay (interquartile range 2–17). The use of titanium as the material for the initial cranioplasty (P = 0.58), the presence of skull fracture(s) (P > .99) or scalp laceration(s) (P = 0.32) at the original surgery, and proven local infection before titanium cranioplasty (P = 0.78) were not significantly associated with an increased risk of infection. Infection was significantly more common after titanium cranioplasty for large defects (hemicraniectomy [39%] and bifrontal craniectomy [28%]) than after cranioplasty for small defects (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Complications after using titanium plate for primary or secondary cranioplasty were common (29%) and associated with an increased length of hospital stay. Infection was a major complication (16%), and this suggested that more vigorous perioperative infection prophylaxis is needed for titanium plate cranioplasty.

### Conservative treatment for delayed infection after cranioplasty with titanium alloy [^116RfYSg]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cranioplasty (CP) is considered a low-risk operation in the field of neurosurgery following decompression craniectomy. Nevertheless, CP is still burdened by surgical complications, among which early or late infections are the most common outcome-threatening ones. Most of infection cases occur within a week after CP. Except that, implant-associated scalp infection is the most common complication, and leads to implant removal in many patients with refractory and recurrent infection. The authors reported a patient presenting with epidural infection about 3 months after titanium implant and cured by anti-infective treatment for 2 weeks.

### Pus and free bone flaps [^111wPfFL]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The goal of this investigation is to describe the results of a vigorous attempt to preserve contaminated free bone flaps and avoid the problems associated with the traditional and common practice of discarding the flap, administering a course of antibiotics, and after several months, performing a cranioplasty.

Methods

Patients with clearly contaminated, free cranial bone flaps, including so-called high risk cases, were treated by meticulous debridement of the surgical bed, scrubbing, soaking, and then replacing the bone flap in its normal position, and administering a course of intravenous antibiotics.

Results

Fourteen patients with contaminated avascular cranial bone flaps were treated using this technique. All bone flaps were able to be preserved. Conclusions Patients with bacteriologically contaminated, free bone flaps can be treated successfully without discarding the flaps. Success is dependent upon aggressive surgical debridement and persistence.

### Timing of cranial reconstruction after cranioplasty infections: are we ready for a re-thinking? A comparative analysis of delayed versus immediate cranioplasty after debridement in a series of 48 patients [^113wsuam]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal management of cranioplasty infections remains a matter of debate. Most authors have suggested that the infected bone/implant removal is mandatory, combined with prolonged antibiotic therapy before reconstruction. However, failures can occur, even with 12–18-month intervals between the surgeries. Longer wait times before cranial reconstruction increase the risks of socioeconomic burdens and further complications, as observed in decompressed patients hosting shunts. In our department, we treated 48 cranioplasty infections over a period of 8 years, divided into two groups. For Group A (n = 26), the treatment consisted of cranioplasty removal and debridement, followed by a delayed reconstruction. Group B (n = 22) received 2 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by an "aggressive" field debridement and immediate cranioplasty. All patients received a minimum of 8 weeks of post-operative antibiotic therapy and were scheduled for clinic-radiological follow-ups for at least 36 months. Significant differences were observed between Groups A and B with respect to the number of failures (respectively 7 versus 1), the global operative time (significantly longer for Group B), germ identification (respectively 7 versus 13), and the overall length of hospital stay (on average, 61.04 days in Group A versus 47.41 days in Group B). Three shunted patients in Group A developed sinking flap syndrome. Shunt resetting allowed symptom control until cranioplasty in one subject, whereas two did not improve, even after reconstruction. In selected patients, an aggressive field debridement, followed by the immediate replacement of an infected cranioplasty, may represent a safe and valuable option.

### Cranioplasty approaches and outcomes in low-middle income countries: a systematic review [^116KdB8c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Cranioplasty is a surgical procedure aimed at repairing cranial defects or deformities arising from various etiologies. These include traumatic brain injuries, tumor resections, congenital anomalies, and infections. The primary goal of cranioplasty is to restore the protective barrier of the skull, improve esthetic appearance, and potentially enhance neurological function. There are various materials that can be used to perform a cranioplasty, and the choice of material has evolved over time. While autologous bone grafts are considered the gold standard due to their biocompatibility and potential for osseointegration, their use is limited by availability, resorption rates, and the risk of infection. Consequently, alternative materials have been explored, with polyetheretherketone (PEEK), titanium, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) being among the most commonly used.

PEEK is a semicrystalline thermoplastic with excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and radiolucency, making it an attractive option for cranial reconstruction. Titanium implants, known for their strength, biocompatibility, and lightweight nature, have been extensively used in cranioplasty. Their durability and the ability to integrate with bone tissue without causing adverse immune responses make titanium a reliable choice for long-term cranial reconstruction.PMMA, on the other hand, is a cost-effective acrylic polymer that can be easily molded and has gained popularity in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to its affordability and satisfactory outcome.

Despite the advances in materials and techniques, cranioplasty is associated with various complications, which vary depending on the implant type. Common complications include infection, implant exposure and erosion, and failure, with variable rates that are material specific. Titanium and PEEK yield the lowest rates average rates of infection at ~8%, with autologous flaps slightly worse at 10% and PMMA implants varying between 7% and 10%, depending on whether they are prefabricated, templated, or hand-formed.

### Infection following operations on the central nervous system: deconstructing the myth of the sterile field [^1125p3xa]. Neurosurgical Focus (2012). Low credibility.

Neurosurgical patients are at a high risk for infectious sequelae following operations. For neurosurgery in particular, the risk of surgical site infection has a unique implication given the proximity of the CSF and the CNS. Patient factors contribute to some degree; for example, cancer and trauma are often associated with impaired nutritional status, known risk factors for infection. Additionally, care-based factors for infection must also be considered, such as the length of surgery, the administration of steroids, and tissue devascularization (such as a craniotomy bone flap). When postoperative infection does occur, attention is commonly focused on potential lapses in surgical "sterility". Evidence suggests that the surgical field is not free of microorganisms. The authors propose a paradigm shift in the nomenclature of the surgical field from "sterile" to "clean". Continued efforts aimed at optimizing immune capacity and host defenses to combat potential infection are warranted.

### Analysis of PMMA versus CaP titanium-enhanced implants for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: a retrospective observational cohort study [^112uJuLQ]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

In contrast to alloplastic implants, surgical dissection of ceramic implants was much more difficult due to substantial integration with the surrounding tissue. Extensive adhesions necessitated sharp dissection from the covering skin flap. This seems to further support the potential for improved implant stability and reduced probability of dislocation. It is also of note that despite contamination of the atrophic skin dehiscence, no bacterial contamination was found on the underlying ceramic implant. Implant-associated infections involve biofilms that are challenging to eradicate. Despite biofilm-active antibiotic therapy, implant removal is necessary in most cases. It is possible that antimicrobial treatment will be more effective in bioactive implants. One reason why medical devices get colonized by bacterial biofilms is that a considerably lower bacterial load is needed in comparison to native tissue. Another explanation is the lack of vascularization, rendering implants more susceptible than other tissues and organs in the human body. In theory, bioactive CaP implants overcome the shortcoming by promoting neovascularization, reducing the occurrence of biofilms, and improving the delivery of drugs such as antibiotics to the site of infection. Strong osseointegrative properties also relate to vascularization and soft tissue coverage, and an excellent soft tissue coverage due to robust osseointegration, promotion of vascularization, and tissue ingrowth via multiple interconnected spaces should facilitate improved wound healing, prevention of atrophy, and, with them reduced risk of SSI.

There was no difference in rates of postoperative complications such as epidural hematoma or seizures. This is not unexpected, as the main osseointegrative, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive advantages of the novel bioactive compound come to bear over time without immediate impact on the postoperative course.

Generalizability

As always, caution is a prime requirement when drawing conclusions from results in small patient groups. Further research will show if these promising results can be confirmed in larger and prospective trials. Here, CaP implants reduce the risk of SSI and the rate of explantations after cranioplasty compared to allogenic materials independent from time of cranioplasty and underlying cause for hemicraniectomy. It is expected that differences of standard of care should not vary the presented results. Although implant-associated late infections are known and reported, they were not observed in our patient population with the CaP implants during an adequate follow-up period. More extended follow-up periods should determine whether bioactive CaP implants retain their advantages regarding infection and clarify the treatment strategies. The presented data reflects the current state of knowledge and may thus be of use for clinical decision-making as it stands.

### Complications of cranioplasty in relationship to traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Nu24e]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Management of severe intracranial hypertension, when conservative therapies fail, may require DC, which is often followed by CP after patient stabilization and optimization. Despite being a time-honored and seemingly "straightforward" procedure, CP is burdened by a complication rate of up to 40%, some of which are severe enough to compromise the outcome of the initial brain injury. Documented complications following CP include, among others: seizures, ICH, EFC, infections, hydrocephalus, BFR, mechanical complications (MC), cerebral edema, and neurological deficits (NDs).

In recent years, a considerable number of studies explored the various risk factors and pathological mechanisms underlying complications of CP after different brain injuries not limited to trauma. However, very few of those studies evaluated whether the type of initial injury may represent a risk factor for post-CP complications.

Victims of TBI constitute the largest group of patients requiring DC and subsequent CP. In those patients, factors such as impaired wound sterility due to traumatic contamination, scalp lacerations, multiple complex skull fractures, diffuse axonal injury, and pericontusional ischemia may all increase the risk of post-CP complications and be detrimental to the long-term outcome of the patient.

This study aimed to compare the rates and types of post-CP complications between TBI patients and patients suffering from other primary pathologies, via a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, supplemented by our institutional experience. By elucidating the relationship between TBI and specific complications following CP, it may be possible to prevent neurological damage and minimize the risk of complications linked to CP, thus potentially improving neurologic outcome.

### Extensive convexity flattening of a synthetic skull implant the overcome major scalp deficiency after multiple craniotomies [^113JuMi4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary scalp reconstruction and cranioplasty is a common neurosurgical procedure that is accompanied with several challenges. Among others, primary tension-free defect closure to prevent scalp wound dehiscence and distal scalp flap necrosis and consecutive exposure of the autologous or alloplastic customized bone flap is critical. In particular, any degree of alloplastic implant exposure leads to contamination and infection, which forces implant removal and adjacent bone flap osteomyelitis, which in turn can be an independent risk factors for further complications. In addition, infection at the scalp defect site aggravates skin scarring and scalp tissue thinning, which further increases the possibility of wound dehiscence.

In the case of tension-free wound closure, however, alloplastic implants offer excellent functional and cosmetic outcomes in case autologous bone reimplantation is infeasible. At the time of this writing, there are different methods available, with slightly curvature flattening recently proposed to optimize scalp skin tension with consideration of the cosmetic outcome.

Here, we describe a last resort treatment strategy for scalp release in a patient with substantial skin tension despite bridging flap and split-thickness skin graft. A custom-made alloplastic implant was extensively flattened in the curvature of the fronto-parietal area with consideration of the related brain hemisphere extension but less the cosmetic outcome. Different surgical approaches with functional as well as cosmetic outcomes are discussed.

### Surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113cA5Df]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Question: what is the appropriate selection and duration of perioperative antibiotics in the setting of craniotomy/craniectomy?

Recommendation

A single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis given within 60 minutes prior to incision is recommended for prevention of SSI and meningitis in patients who undergo cranial operative intervention. Cefazolin is usually sufficient but in patients colonized with MRSA or institutions with high rates of MRSA, vancomycin may be warranted.

Discussion

SSI and central nervous system infections after cranial surgery (craniotomy or craniectomy) are rare but can result in lasting morbidity and mortality. Multiple randomized controlled trials from the 1980s demonstrated a significant decrease in SSI and postoperative infections for patients who received perioperative antibiotics, compared with placebo. No recent randomized studies have been published since antibiotic prophylaxis is now considered standard of care; however, a meta-analysis found decreased odds of meningitis in patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis (1.1% vs. 2.7%) compared with patients who did not receive prophylaxis.

S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of SSIs. MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococci infections are less common but are increasing in prevalence. Gram-negative and polymicrobial infections are responsible for a small portion of cases. Multiple studies have shown no difference in infection rates with different antibiotic selections and most studies use a single dose of antibiotics. Therefore, a single dose of cefazolin, given within 60 minutes prior to incision for all patients undergoing craniotomy or craniectomy, is generally recommended as the prophylactic antibiotic of choice. However, there is some evidence for the dual use of cefazolin and vancomycin. Corsini Campioli et al performed a logistic regression to identify predictors of SSI and found dual therapy with cefazolin and vancomycin was associated with fewer SSIs. Although not supported by strong evidence, in institutions with a high prevalence of MRSA, prophylaxis with dual therapy may be considered.

### The utility of routine autologous bone-flap swab cultures in predicting post-cranioplasty infection [^114AdT3F]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of autologous bone-flap swab cultures performed at the time of cranioplasty in predicting postcranioplasty surgical site infection (SSI).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients undergoing craniectomy (with bone-flap storage in tissue bank), followed by delayed autologous bone-flap replacement cranioplasty between January 1, 2010, and November 30, 2020.

Setting

Tertiary-care academic hospital.

Methods

We framed the bone-flap swab culture taken at the time of cranioplasty as a diagnostic test for predicting postcranioplasty SSI. We calculated, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios.

Results

Among 282 unique eligible cases, 16 (5.6%) developed SSI after cranioplasty. A high percentage of bone-flap swab cultures were positive at the time of craniectomy (66.7%) and cranioplasty (59.5%). Most organisms from bone-flap swab cultures were Cutibacterium acnes or coagulase-negative staphylococci (76%-85%), and most SSI pathogens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (38%). Bone-flap swab culture had poor sensitivity (0.07; 95% CI, 0.01–0.31), specificity (0.4; 95% CI, 0.34–0.45), and positive likelihood ratio (0.12) for predicting postcranioplasty SSI.

Conclusion

Overall, autologous bone-flap swab cultures performed at the time of cranioplasty have poor utility in predicting postcranioplasty SSI. Eliminating this low-value practice would result in significant workload reductions and associated healthcare costs.

### First-in-human experience with integration of a hydrocephalus shunt device within a customized cranial implant [^117Cmkkf]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydrocephalus shunting is one of the most common procedures performed in all types of neurosurgery. More importantly, implanted hydrocephalus shunts, and their accompanying valves, are manufactured in numerous designs/shapes with a common valve thickness between 3 and 10 mm. Most devices are constructed using a combination of rigid plastic and/or silicone placed in the subgaleal space external to the skull in close proximity to the ventricle. However, although their material may be modified in composition, all shunt devices are designed for placement within the head at a "nonanatomic" location fraught with complication between the thin, mobile scalp and the strong, immobile skull. Overall, it is the nonanatomical placement of valve hardware, combined with their rigid construction, which may contribute to their high complication rates approaching 40 to 60%. In fact, complication rates are even more staggering (around 70–80%) in those who have undergone at least one previous shunt revision.

Shunt-related complications requiring surgical revision are categorized as either "catheter-related" (ie, proximal or distal obstruction) or "scalp-related" (ie, extrusion through scalp, infection, wound dehiscence, etc). Despite numerous strategies for reducing infection, it remains the most common complication with an incidence approaching 30%. However, each case of "infection" is different, since the true etiology may include (1) bacterial contamination at time of placement, (2) systemic seeding from blood-borne pathogens, or (3) primary scalp dehiscence/shunt extrusion leading to secondary infection. In other words, infection may not be the sole cause of failure, depending on which condition came first. For example, infection may result from secondary contamination following scalp breakdown, and thus, it is sometimes misclassified as "infection" and not as "incisional dehiscence/scalp wound". This sequela occurs from excessive scalp tension over the nonanatomical, high-profile device and long-standing pressure from underneath causing localized ischemia and tissue necrosis.

### Cranioplasty with auto-purified bone flap after infection [^113TApxo]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cranioplasty of cranial bone defects can generally be accomplished with autogeneous bones as well as with nonbiological materials. Autologous living-bone grafts are ideal but require sacrifice of donor bone, and synthetic materials might have possible exposure of the materials, delayed infection, and/or allergic reaction. The authors report cranioplasty with a bone graft after auto-purification by subcutaneous preservation of the contaminated bone fragment. A 47-year-old man was given a frontal cranioplasty with a split parietal bone and rib. Epidural abscess ensued, and debridement was performed to control the infection. The largest bone fragment was subcutaneously preserved in the chest wall and reused for cranioplasty. Subcutaneous preservation of bone is a promising strategy for cranioplasty after neurosurgery. The condition of the bone fragment can be inferred from the condition of the site at which it is preserved. If the bone flap is contaminated, it can be purified by the patient's immune system.

### Risk factors for surgical site infections and assessment of vancomycin powder as a preventive measure in patients undergoing first-time cranioplasty [^113CQbVo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Craniectomy is often performed to decrease intracranial pressure following trauma and vascular injuries. The subsequent cranioplasty procedures may be complicated by surgical site infections (SSIs) due to prior trauma, foreign implants, and multiple surgeries through a common incision. Several studies have found that intrawound vancomycin powder (VP) is associated with decreased risk of SSIs after spine operations. However, no previously published study has evaluated the effectiveness of VP in cranioplasty procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intrawound VP is associated with decreased risk of SSIs, to evaluate VP's safety, and to identify risk factors for SSIs after cranioplasty among patients undergoing first-time cranioplasty. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing first-time cranioplasty for indications other than infections from January 1, 2008, to July 31, 2014, at an academic health center. Data on demographics, possible risk factors for SSIs, and treatment with VP were collected from the patients' electronic health records. RESULTS During the study period, 258 patients underwent first-time cranioplasties, and 15 (5.8%) of these patients acquired SSIs. Ninety-two patients (35.7%) received intrawound VP (VP group) and 166 (64.3%) did not (no-VP group). Patients in the VP group and the no-VP group were similar with respect to age, sex, smoking history, body mass index, and SSI rates (VP group 6.5%, no-VP group 5.4%, p = 0.72). Patients in the VP group were less likely than those in the no-VP group to have undergone craniectomy for tumors and were more likely to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score > 2. Intrawound VP was not associated with other postoperative complications. Risk factors for SSI from the bivariable analyses were diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.65, 95% CI 1.07–12.44), multiple craniotomy procedures before the cranioplasty (OR 4.39, 95% CI 1.47–13.18), prior same-side craniotomy (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.57–14.24), and prosthetic implants (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.40–14.59). The multivariable analysis identified prior same-side craniotomy (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.06–10.79) and prosthetic implants (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.15–13.40) as significant risk factors for SSIs. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with SSIs were more likely than those without SSIs to be readmitted (OR 7.28, 95% CI 2.07–25.60). CONCLUSIONS In this study, intrawound VP was not associated with a decreased risk of SSIs or with an increased risk of complications. Prior same-side craniotomy and prosthetic implants were risk factors for SSI after first-time cranioplasty.

### A preliminary report on the use of antibiotic-impregnated methyl methacrylate in salvage cranioplasty [^1159N3oS]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In the setting of recurrent infection and multiple failed reconstruction attempts, the choice of the ideal reconstructive material for salvage cranioplasty remains a source of controversy in the literature. The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and utility of antibiotic-impregnated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) for salvage cranioplasty. A prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent salvage cranioplasty using vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated methyl methacrylate from January 2011 to July 2013 was reviewed. Vancomycin and tobramycin were mixed in PMMA, which was then applied to a rigidly fixed titanium mesh for reconstruction. Patients' demographics, indications, and outcomes of this technique were evaluated. Nine patients (mean age: 47 years) underwent vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated PMMA reconstruction with a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 3.5–23 months). On average, these patients underwent 4 procedures (range: 1–15), which included repeat craniotomy, debridement for infection, and failed reconstructions over the course of 3.6 years (range: 7 months to 14 years) before salvage cranioplasty. All patients required salvage cranioplasty due to infection, with the most common bacteria isolated in culture being Propionibacterium acnes (n = 3), multiresistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), and Enterobacter (n = 2). The average size of the craniectomy defect was 130 cm², and there were no incidences of postoperative infection, postoperative complications, or need for revisions. To conclude, in short-term follow-up, vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated PMMA reconstruction appears safe and effective in salvage cranioplasty. Our early report represents a proof of concept — the true test is whether these short-term successes translate to stable long-term results.

### Complications of cranioplasty in relationship to traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YRm4y]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Infection

In total, 40 studies reported infection rates. The pooled rate was 10.0% (546/5461), consisting of 11.0% (325/2960) in TBI patients and 8.8% (221/2501) in non-TBI patients. In our series, we considered as complicated by infection every cranioplasty associated with persistent fever, raised inflammatory parameters, and/or local swelling or pus. We also considered infected the skull flaps that resulted positive for microbial growth at the time of revision surgery. If both BFR and infection were present in the same patient, the patient was considered as affected by two complications.

Twenty-nine of the studies reporting infection rates allowed for comparison between TBI and non-TBI patients (Fig. 6). The pooled rate of infection from these studies was 10.0% (n = 461/4609), ranging from 2.0 to 24.4%.

Fig. 6
Forest plot of studies reporting post-cranioplasty infection in TBI and non-TBI patients

There was a significant increase in the odds of infection in TBI patients (n = 262/2304 procedures, 11.4%) when compared with non-TBI patients (n = 199/2305, 8.6%; OR 1.38, CI 1.05–1.80, and p = 0.02) using a random-effects model (I² = 32% and p = 0.05). This was true with (Fig. 6) or without the addition of the cases of our series (Supplementary Fig. S 6).

### Predictors of infection after 754 cranioplasty operations and the value of intraoperative cultures for cryopreserved bone flaps [^116q6eZj]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors' aim was to report the largest study on predictors of infection after cranioplasty and to assess the predictive value of intraoperative bone flap cultures before cryopreservation. METHODS They retrospectively examined all cranioplasties performed between March 2004 and November 2014. Throughout this study period, the standard protocol during initial craniectomy was to obtain a culture swab of the extracted autologous bone flap (ABF)-prior to its placement in cytostorage-to screen for microbial contamination. Two consecutive protocols were employed for the use and interpretation of the intraoperative swab culture results: A) From March 2004 through June 2013, any culture-positive ABF (+ABF) was discarded and a custom synthetic prosthesis was implanted at the time of cranioplasty. B) From July 2013 through November 2014, any ABF with a skin flora organism was not discarded. Instead, cryopreservation was maintained and the +ABF was reimplanted after a 10-minute soak in bacitracin irrigation as well as a 3-minute soak in betadine. RESULTS Over the 10.75-year period, 754 cranioplasty procedures were performed. The median time from craniectomy to cranioplasty was 123 days. Median follow-up after cranioplasty was 237 days for protocol A and 225 days for protocol B. The overall infection rate after cranioplasty was 6.6% (50 cases) occurring at a median postoperative Day 31. Staphylococcus spp. were involved as the causative organisms in 60% of cases. Culture swabs taken at the time of initial craniectomy were available for 640 ABFs as 114 ABFs were not salvageable. One hundred twenty-six (20%) were culture positive. Eighty-nine +ABFs occurred during protocol A and were discarded in favor of a synthetic prosthesis at the time of cranioplasty, whereas 37 +ABFs occurred under protocol B and were reimplanted at the time of cranioplasty. Cranioplasty material did not affect the postcranioplasty infection rate. There was no significant difference in the infection rate among sterile ABFs (7%), +ABFs (8%), and synthetic prostheses (5.5%; p = 0.425). All 3 +ABF infections under protocol B were caused by organisms that differed from those in the original intraoperative bone culture from the initial craniectomy. A cranioplasty procedure ≤ 14 days after initial craniectomy was the only significant predictor of postcranioplasty infection (p = 0.007, HR 3.62). CONCLUSIONS Cranioplasty procedures should be performed at least 14 days after initial craniectomy to minimize infection risk. Obtaining intraoperative bone cultures at the time of craniectomy in the absence of clinical infection should be discontinued as the culture results were not a useful predictor of postcranioplasty infection and led to the unnecessary use of synthetic prostheses and increased health care costs.

### Presence of Propionibacterium acnes in patients with aseptic bone graft resorption after cranioplasty: preliminary evidence for low-grade infection [^113qLpuw]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Autologous bone graft reimplantation remains the standard treatment after decompressive hemicraniectomy. Unfortunately, some patients present with signs of bone resorption without any visible signs of infection; the reasons remain unknown. Contamination with Propionibacterium acnes has been discussed as a potential source of the osteolytic process. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial spectrum detected in samples of grafts from patients with aseptic bone resorption and compare them to septic bone graft infections in order to identify P. acnes as the specific pathogen of aseptic bone resorption.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for aseptic bone resorption between 2012 and 2017 in their neurosurgical department. Septic infections were used as a control group to gain information on the present bacterial spectrum. Perioperative data such as demographics, number of surgeries, and complications were assessed and compared with the microbiological analyses conducted in order to detect differences and potential sources for aseptic bone resorption and possible differences in bacterial contamination in septic and aseptic bone infection.

Results

In total, 38 patients underwent surgery between 2012 and 2017 for septic bone infection-14 for aseptic bone resorption. In 100% of the septic bone infection cases in which bone flap removal was needed, bacteria could be isolated from the removed bone flap (55% Staphylococcus aureus, 13.2% Enterococcus faecalis, and 18.4% Staphylococcus epidermidis). The microbial spectrum from samples of aseptic bone flaps with resorption was examined in 10 of 14 patients and revealed contamination with P. acnes in 40% (n = 4, the other 6 bone grafts were sterile), especially in sonication analysis, whereas visible septic bone infection was mainly caused by S. aureus without detection of P. acnes.

Conclusions

Aseptic bone resorption may be caused by low-grade infections with P. acnes. However, further analysis needs to be conducted in order to understand its clinical relevance and treatment perspective.

### Evaluation of neurosurgical implant infection rates and associated pathogens: evidence from 1118 postoperative infections [^116ZKzDC]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Various implanted materials are used in neurosurgery; however, there remains a lack of pooled data on infection rates (IRs) and infective bacteria over past decades. The goal of this study was to investigate implant infections in neurosurgical procedures in a longitudinal retrospective study and to evaluate the IRs of neurosurgically implanted materials and the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases for the time period between 1968 and 2018. Neurosurgical implant infections were studied in 5 subgroups, including operations or diseases, implanted materials, bacteria, distribution by country, and time periods, which were obtained from the literature and statistically analyzed. In this meta-analysis, statistical heterogeneity across studies was tested by using p values and I² values between studies of associated pathogens. Egger's test was used for assessing symmetries of funnel plots with Stata 11.0 software. Methodological quality was assessed to judge the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook.

Results

A total of 22,971 patients from 227 articles satisfied the study's eligibility criteria. Of these, 1118 cases of infection were reported, and the overall IR was 4.87%. In this study, the neurosurgical procedures or disorders with the top 3 IRs included craniotomy (IR 6.58%), cranioplasty (IR 5.89%), and motor movement disorders (IR 5.43%). Among 13 implanted materials, the implants with the top 3 IRs included polypropylene-polyester, titanium, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK), which were 8.11%, 8.15%, and 7.31%, respectively. Furthermore, the main causative pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus and the countries with the top 3 IRs were Denmark (IR 11.90%), Korea (IR 10.98%), and Mexico (IR 9.26%). Except for the low IR from 1998 to 2007, the overall implant IR after neurosurgical procedures was on the rise.

Conclusions

In this study, the main pathogen in neurosurgery was S. aureus, which can provide a certain reference for the clinic. In addition, the IRs of polypropylene-polyester, titanium, and PEEK were higher than other materials, which means that more attention should be paid to them. In short, the total IR was high in neurosurgical implants and should be taken seriously.

### The antibiotic immersion of custom-made porous hydroxyapatite cranioplasty: a multicentric cohort study [^112dg9RP]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cranioplasty is a common neurosurgical procedure performed to reconstruct cranial defects. The most common cranioplasty materials used today can be divided into 2 types: autologous bone and bone substitutes, such as polyetheretherketone, titanium mesh, poly-methyl methacrylate, and Hydroxyapatite (HA). Infection represents one of the most feared complications, ranging from 2.3% to 20%. Early implant infections occur within 30 days from the operation and are mostly due to pathogens from the skin and the paranasal cavity. The authors aim to demonstrate the efficacy of our preoperative antibiotic immersion protocol of custom-made HA prosthesis, to prevent early implant infections. The authors compare this population to cranioplasties without preoperative antibiotic elution and those with anonstandardized antibiotic elution. The authors retrospectively analyzed data from patients referred to 6 different hospitals in northern Italy, in the period 2000 to 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients requiring reconstruction of thecal bone with HA prosthesis after post-traumatic decompressive surgery; age more than 18 years; detailed patient history and clinical data; and follow-up of minimum 6 months. A total of 77 cranioplasties were included in the study, along with 120 retrospective cases in comparison. Infections occurred in 2.6% of cranioplasties with antibiotic immersion compared to 7.8% of cranioplasties without. Even if nonsignificant, these results support our hypothesis that pretreatment of HA implants with antibiotic appears to prevent cranioplasty infections and could be a viable option to improve cranioplasty outcomes in the future.

### Clinical outcomes in cranioplasty: risk factors and choice of reconstructive material [^116rbukh]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Continuing advances in cranioplasty have enabled repair of increasingly complicated cranial defects. However, the optimal materials and approaches for particular clinical scenarios remain unclear. This study examines outcomes following cranioplasty for a variety of indications in patients treated with alloplastic material, autogenous tissue, or a combination of both.

Methods The Authors Conducted

a retrospective analysis on 180 patients who had 195 cranioplasties performed between 1993 and 2010.

Results

Materials used for cranioplasty included alloplastic for 42.6 percent (83 of 195), autologous for 19.0 percent (37 of 195), and both combined for 38.5 percent (75 of 195). Mean defect size was 70.5 cm. A subset of patients had undergone previous irradiation (12.2 percent; 22 of 180) or had preoperative infections (30.6 percent; 55 of 180). The most common complication was postoperative infection (15.9 percent; 31 of 195). Factors that significantly predisposed to complications included preoperative radiation, previous infection, and frontal location. Preoperative radiation was the strongest predictor of having any postoperative complications, with an adjusted odds ratio of 6.91 (p < 0.005). Irradiated patients (OR, 7.96; p < 0.05) and patients undergoing frontal cranioplasties (OR, 2.83; p < 0.05) were more likely to require repeated operation. Preoperative infection predisposed patients to exposure of hardware in alloplastic reconstructions (OR, 3.13; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Despite the evolution of cranioplasty techniques and materials, complications are not uncommon. The choice of reconstructive material may modify the risk of developing postoperative complications but appears less important than the clinical history in affecting outcome.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^111DCB1s]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics after rhinoplasty — The purpose is to encourage surgeons who choose to prescribe antibiotics after rhinoplasty to prescribe them for no more than 24 hours, and the GDG supports the use of a single preoperative dose and no more than 24 hours of postoperative antibiotics if postsurgical therapy is prescribed. Value judgments note antibiotics are commonly prescribed despite a lack of evidence to support benefits beyond a single intraoperative dose or > 24 hours after surgery, and the policy level states Recommendation against. Reported wound infection rates are low, with a small infection rate (0.48–0.6%) after septorhinoplasty among patients not given prophylactic antibiotics; in one study without preoperative antibiotics, Staphylococcus epidermidis (82.7%) and Streptococcus viridans (17.3%) were most common and no patient had a local or systemic infection during a 60-day follow-up period. Literature also supports a preoperative dose within 1 hour before incision and no more than 24 hours of postoperative coverage for clean-contaminated surgery.

### First report of a multicenter prospective registry of cranioplasty in the United Kingdom and Ireland [^114BQ9c4]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are many questions that remain unanswered regarding outcomes following cranioplasty including the timing of cranioplasty following craniectomy as well as the material used.

Objective

To establish and evaluate 30-d outcomes for all cranial reconstruction procedures in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland through a prospective multicenter cohort study.

Methods

Patients undergoing cranioplasty insertion or revision between June 1, 2019 and November 30, 2019 in 25 neurosurgical units were included. Data collected include demographics, craniectomy date and indication, cranioplasty material and date, and 30-d outcome.

Results

In total, 313 operations were included, consisting of 255 new cranioplasty insertions and 58 revisions. Of the new insertions, the most common indications for craniectomy were traumatic brain injury (n = 110, 43%), cerebral infarct (n = 38, 15%), and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 30, 12%). The most common material was titanium (n = 163, 64%). Median time to cranioplasty was 244 d (interquartile range 144–385), with 37 new insertions (15%) within or equal to 90 d. In 30-d follow-up, there were no mortalities. There were 14 readmissions, with 10 patients sustaining a wound infection within 30 d (4%). Of the 58 revisions, the most common reason was due to infection (n = 33, 59%) and skin breakdown (n = 13, 23%). In 41 (71%) cases, the plate was removed during the revision surgery.

Conclusion

This study is the largest prospective study of cranioplasty representing the first results from the UK Cranial Reconstruction Registry, a first national registry focused on cranioplasty with the potential to address outstanding research questions for this procedure.

### Cranioplasty approaches and outcomes in low-middle income countries: a systematic review [^1163zKMn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of Delayed Cranioplasty on Complication Rates

The mean time to cranioplasty for patients in LMIC was 8.51 months in this systematic review. In the literature, time to cranioplasty is categorized into "early" (≤ 90 d or 12 wk) and "late" (> 90 d or 12 wk) cranioplasties. Late cranioplasties were significantly associated with increased infection rates in a study by Oh et al, which reported the infection rate of early cranioplasty to be lower than that of late cranioplasty (7% versus 20%; P = 0.02). The majority of our sample consisted of late cranioplasties, with an overall complication rate of 17.5% and an infection rate of 5.1%; less than the reported late cranioplasty complication rate of 20% of Oh and colleagues. From this review, there is evidence that complication rates are not increased in LMICs and instead are within a similar complication rate to late cranioplasties performed in high-income countries. The success in which surgeons in LMICs perform late cranioplasties with similar or decreased complication rates to the literature emphasizes the importance of examining global literature and surgical techniques of countries historically underrepresented in mainstream scientific literature or popular medical journals. Oh et alalso found the use of allograft materials was a significant risk factor for infection (OR, 12.4; 95% CI: 3.24–47.33; P < 0.01). However, the International Consensus Meeting on Post-Traumatic Cranioplasty suggested that defining a time frame for cranioplasty is somewhat artificial, given the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios, but it can be useful for clinical benchmarking and research purposes. Consequently, the lower complication rate reported for this systematic review may be due in part to the absence of allograft usage or the potential clinical insignificance of delayed time to cranioplasty.

Ventriculoatrial shunts — blood culture use and expected results: In patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, blood cultures should be performed because bacteremia is invariably present in patients with infected ventriculoatrial shunts (positive blood cultures in > 90% of cases). This contrasts with infections in other types of CSF shunts in which the incidence of negative blood cultures approaches 80%. Blood cultures may be considered in these patients, although positive results should be interpreted cautiously in patients with nonvascular CSF shunts and may represent a contaminant or another source of infection.

### Cranial bone flap resorption-pathological features and their implications for clinical treatment [^116SxPFK]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranioplastic surgery following decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a well-established neurosurgical intervention. The operation not only restores the integrity of the skull but also seems to have positive effects on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. There is evidence that the rehabilitation potential as well as the neurological outcome of patients improves after cranioplasty. In addition, the procedure helps to achieve a cosmetically satisfactory result.

The restoration of the integrity of the skull can be achieved either by reimplantation of the autologous bone or by allogenic material such as bone cement (polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) or a previously manufactured patient-specific implant (PSI) made of titanium or polyether ether ketone (PEEK).

The literature regarding a potential correlation between graft material and infection rate is inconsistent. Matsuno et al. describe a significant infection rate for titanium mesh compared to autologous bone flaps and PMMA. However, while the implantation of the autologous bone is associated with significantly lower costs than the manufacturing of a PSI, a particular disadvantage remains: the occurrence of aseptic bone resorption (ABR) is a specific and not to be underestimated complication of this method that leads to a considerable number of patients requiring further surgery.

This resorption leads to structural instability and consecutive loss of protective function in addition to the already existing risk of infection.

The rate of ABR varies in the literature with incidences around 20%. Bone flap fragmentation, shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, and especially, young age have been discussed lately as risk factors leading to ABR. Furthermore, some authors suggest a relationship between the method of storage, preparation of the implant, time interval between DC and reimplantation ("freezer time"), or the size of the defect. A possible contamination and subsequent low-grade infection with Propionibacterium acnes has been discussed as a potential risk factor as well. Schütz et al. were further able to show that hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors had a lower ABR rate than patients treated with other antihypertensive medication or patients who do not suffer from arterial hypertension.

Despite these frequent descriptions of ABR in the literature, we still lack a thorough understanding of the physiology of bony reintegration at the skull and thus the underlying pathology leading to the pathological process of resorption.

Therefore, the aim of this work was the histopathological examination of resorbed and intact bone flaps to gain a better and detailed understanding of the underlying processes.

### Infectious complications after open cranial vault remodeling for craniosynostosis [^112YYqst]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) after open cranial vault reconstruction (CVR), while relatively uncommon, has received little attention in the literature to date. Here, the authors report our institution's experience with the perioperative management of infectious complications following CVR for craniosynostosis and present the first systematic review of the literature on this topic.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review for patients with syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostosis who underwent open CVR between 1990 and 2015 at a single institution to determine predictors of SSIs and a systematic review of studies that evaluated for SSI after CVR to ascertain the pooled incidence of SSI, common infectious organisms, and prophylactic antibiotic protocols.

Results

Out of 548 primary and 163 secondary CVR cases at our institution, 6 primary reconstruction patients (1.09%) and 9 secondary reconstruction patients (5.52%) developed an SSI requiring extended hospital stay or readmission (P < 0.001); overall infection rate was 2.11%. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species were the most common organisms isolated. On multivariate analysis, syndromic status conferred more than 7 times greater odds of SSI (OR 7.7, P = 0.023). Pooled analysis of the literature yielded an overall SSI rate of 1.05% to 2.01%. In contrast to our institutional findings, the most common organisms reported were Candida species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most common prophylactic antibiotic protocol was a first-generation cephalosporin for 24 to 72hours post-operatively.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing secondary reconstruction have higher infection rates after CVR, and syndromic status is an important predictor of infection when controlling for other patient factors. Our literature review reveals nosocomial organisms to be the most commonly reported source of infection, though this is contrary to our institutional findings of skin flora being most common. Antibiotic prophylaxis varies institutionally.

The effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in craniotomies has been clarified through the accumulation of evidence and increased antibiotic knowledge. This paper focuses on the use of AP in craniotomies during different historical periods and collects highly relevant evidence on this issue. This review surveys different AP guidelines and explains why cefazolin was selected by most guidelines. Recent prominent topics, including strategies to update and implement guidelines and antibiotic efficacy in postoperative meningitis and surveillance and decolonization therapies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are discussed.

### Postoperative Staphylococcus aureus infections in patients with and without preoperative colonization [^113jn7X1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the cumulative incidence of Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections (SSIs) and bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Europe, and what factors are associated with an increased risk of SSIs and BSIs?

Findings

In a cohort study of 5004 surgical patients, the weighted cumulative incidence of S aureus SSIs and BSIs was 1.23%. Preoperative S aureus carriage, mastectomy or neurosurgery, higher body mass index, and having nonremovable implants in the body were independently associated with S aureus SSIs and BSIs.

Meaning

Staphylococcus aureus SSIs and BSIs are important postoperative complications, and future interventions aimed at prevention of these infections should focus on at-risk surgical patient groups to achieve a higher efficacy.

### Cranial repair: how complicated is filling a "hole"? [^115xfQ6P]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

In general, cranioplasty is viewed as a straightforward surgical procedure, and for many years the complications associated with the procedure have been underestimated. We reviewed our 5-year experience consisting of 218 cranioplasties. Study outcomes focused specifically on the occurrence of complications after cranioplasty. Autologous bone-assisted and prosthetic cranioplasties were considered. Variables described by other authors to be associated with complications were studied, including history of previous cranioplasty, wider craniectomy size, bifrontal craniectomy, and delayed cranioplasty. We also analyzed the influence of material used for craniectomy on the occurrence of complications. The overall complication rate was 19.7%. Nineteen cases of infection (8.7%), 5 cases of postoperative wound dehiscence (2.3%), 6 cases of epidural hemorrhage (2.8%), and 13 cases of cranioplasty dislocation (5.9%) were observed. Bifrontal cranioplasties were more frequently associated with complications (p = 0.01; Fisher's exact test) and infection (p < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test). Postoperative wound dehiscence was more frequently observed with hand-made or custom-made cranioplasties compared with autologous cranioplasties (p = 0.02). Early cranioplasty (< 3 months from craniectomy) was significantly associated with cranioplasty dislocation (p = 0.03). Logistical regression analysis showed that the only factor independently associated with complication was the site of cranioplasty (p = 0.01). In particular, patients with a bifrontal cranioplasty had a 2-fold increased risk of complication (CI 95 1.1–3.6, p = 0.017) and a 2.5-fold increased risk of developing infection (CI 95 1.3–4.9, p = 0.009) compared with hemispheric/bihemispheric cranioplasty. Our analysis confirms that cranioplasty is burdened by a significant complication rate. In this context, bifrontal cranioplasty is related to a higher risk of complication and, in particular, infection.

### Management of postneurosurgical bone flap loss caused by infection [^1142jtNG]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should: 1. Be able to define indications and timing for secondary cranioplasty. 2. Understand the surgical options for reconstructing the cranium and overlying soft-tissue defect including their advantages and disadvantages. 3. Be able to apply this knowledge to the clinical setting of an infectious bone flap loss.

Background

Infection after craniotomy occurs in approximately 1.1 to 8.1 percent of cases and often necessitates bone flap removal. For a secondary cranioplasty, there is an increased risk of recurrent infection, which influences the reconstructive plan. The soft tissue/scalp is frequently compromised by infection, sequelae of prior surgery, and/or adjuvant radiation therapy.

Methods

A literature review was conducted to compile and summarize the indications for secondary cranioplasty after infectious bone flap loss, the timing of the procedure, and the surgical options for bone and soft-tissue reconstruction. In coordination with soft-tissue coverage, cranioplasty options include alloplastic reconstruction, allogeneic or autogenous bone grafts, and free tissue transfer.

Results

The literature review identified the following factors that must be considered in the treatment plan for secondary cranioplasty after postneurosurgical bone flap loss: indications, timing of reconstruction, soft-tissue status and the need for soft-tissue reconstruction, and method of cranioplasty.

Conclusions

Treatment recommendations for cranioplasty in the clinical setting of infectious postneurosurgical bone flap loss are presented. These guidelines consider the risk factors for a recurrent infection, the condition of the soft-tissue coverage, and the concavity of the preoperative cranial deformity.

### Time interval reduction for delayed implant-based cranioplasty reconstruction in the setting of previous bone flap osteomyelitis [^112qo28S]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Reinfections following implant-based cranioplasty, in the setting of previous bone flap osteomyelitis, are common and associated with significant morbidity. The timing of reconstruction following initial osteomyelitic bone flap removal remains controversial; most advocate for prolonged time intervals of approximately 6 to 12 months. Thus, the authors investigated their delayed cranioplasty outcomes following both early (between 90 and 179 days) and late (≥ 180 days) time intervals with custom craniofacial implants to determine whether timing affected outcomes and rates of reinfection.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective cohort review of 25 consecutive cranioplasties, from 2012 to 2014, was conducted. A nonparametric bivariate analysis compared variables and complications between the two different time interval groups, defined as early cranioplasty (between 90 and 179 days) and cranioplasty (≥ 180 days).

Results

No significant differences were found in primary and secondary outcomes in patients who underwent early versus late cranioplasty (p > 0.29). The overall reinfection rate was only 4 percent (one of 25), with the single reinfection occurring in the late group. Overall, the major complication rate was 8 percent (two of 25). Complete and subgroup analyses of specific complications yielded no significant differences between the early and late time intervals (p > 0.44).

Conclusions

The results suggest that early cranioplasty is a viable treatment option for patients with previous bone flap osteomyelitis and subsequent removal. As such, a reduced time interval of 3 months — with equivalent outcomes and reinfection rates — represents a promising area for future study aiming to reduce the morbidity surrounding prolonged time intervals.

### Predictors of cranioplasty complications in stroke and trauma patients [^115nLd53]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Decompressive craniectomy mandates subsequent cranioplasty. Complications of cranioplasty may be independent of the initial craniectomy, or they may be contingent upon the craniectomy. Authors of this study aimed to identify surgery- and patient-specific risk factors related to the development of surgical site infection and other complications following cranioplasty.

Methods

A consecutive cohort of patients of all ages and both sexes who had undergone cranioplasty following craniectomy for stroke or trauma at a single institution in the period from May 2004 to May 2012 was retrospectively established. Patients who had undergone craniectomy for infectious lesions or neoplasia were excluded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to model and predict determinants related to infection following cranioplasty.

Results

Two hundred thirty-nine patients met the study criteria. The overall rate of complication following cranioplasty was 23.85% (57 patients). Complications included, predominantly, surgical site infection, hydrocephalus, and new-onset seizures. Logistic regression analysis identified previous reoperation (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.30–8.11, p = 0.01) and therapeutic indication for stroke (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.11–5.39, p = 0.03) as significantly associated with the development of cranioplasty infection. Patient age, location of cranioplasty, presence of an intracranial device, bone flap preservation method, cranioplasty material, booking method, and time interval > 90 days between initial craniectomy and cranioplasty were not predictive of the development of cranioplasty infection.

Conclusions

Cranioplasty complications are common. Cranioplasty infection rates are predicted by reoperation following craniectomy and therapeutic indication (stroke). These variables may be associated with patient-centered risk factors that increase cranioplasty infection risk.

### Complications of cranioplasty in relationship to traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174pHt3]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

To the best of our knowledge, this is the only meta-analysis to date exploring the differences in both overall and seven specific post-CP complications between TBI patients and other primary pathologies. Kurland et al. had previously considered the rates of post-CP complications according to different DC indications, including trauma, but their study was only a systematic review, utilizing data pooled from different reports to produce a single large cohort. The current study compared between the different cohorts, giving more weight to larger, less biased ones, and attempting to account for the heterogeneity of data using statistical models. In addition, our study is more specific in its categorization of complications into subgroups and analyzed some complications, like seizures, that were not accounted for by Kurland et al.

However, there are several limitations to our analysis. First, the definition of "craniectomy" varied across studies. While studies in which a significant portion of patients underwent craniectomies for purposes other than the reduction of intracranial pressure (e.g. removal of a skull tumor) were excluded, in few cases, it was impossible to quantify the percentage of non-decompressive craniectomies as the reason for craniectomy was not explicitly stated in the paper.

Second, as previously stated, the complications controlled for by the individual studies varied significantly. In addition, the definitions for some of the complications differed between the authors, particularly for infection. Some studies only considered infection a complication if it required reoperation, whereas others, such as ours, also included infections treated conservatively. Some studies distinguished between surgical site infections, graft infections, and abscesses, while others grouped all under the general definition of infection. Cases of cellulitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, intracranial abscess, and empyema were explicitly specified in some cases studies but not in others. Our analysis therefore grouped all types of infection under a single category.

Third, our analysis did not stratify the data by age, sex, severity of injury, comorbidities, or other variables that may have influenced the results. Neither did it account for the anatomic heterogeneity of CP, as patients with unilateral, bilateral, and bifrontal craniectomies of various sizes were pooled together, even though bifrontal procedures may have significantly higher infection rates and increased risk for reoperation.

### Immediate titanium cranioplasty after debridement and craniectomy for postcraniotomy surgical site infection [^114wy6Uz]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

For postcraniotomy surgical site infection (SSI) involving the bone, typical management involves craniectomy, debridement, and delayed cranioplasty. Disadvantages to delayed cranioplasty include cosmetic deformity, vulnerability of unprotected brain, and risks and costs associated with an additional operation. Many authors have attempted bone flap salvage by using various techniques.

Objective

We evaluate our experience with immediate titanium mesh cranioplasty at the time of craniectomy and debridement.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed SSIs in patients that underwent craniotomy for treatment of a brain tumor. These patients were treated with craniectomy, debridement, and immediate titanium mesh cranioplasty followed by antibiotics. The primary outcome was recurrent infection.

Results

Twelve patients met the inclusion criteria. Risk factors for infection included preoperative radiation therapy (33%), prior craniotomy (33%), and postoperative CSF leak (25%). Median follow-up was 14 months. Ten (83%) patients had long-term resolution without recurrent infection. One patient required additional surgical debridement for persistent infection with successful placement of new titanium mesh. Another patient developed recurrent infection but opted for hospice care because of tumor progression.

Conclusion

This series demonstrates the safety and feasibility of performing immediate titanium cranioplasty at the time of craniectomy and debridement in patients with postcraniotomy infections. This has been shown in patients with risk factors for poor wound healing. Immediate cranioplasty avoids the drawbacks, risks, and costs of delayed cranioplasty.

### Differences in microorganisms causing infection after cranial and spinal surgeries [^114QBFQN]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The primary aim of this retrospective study was to assess differences in the pathogens causing surgical site infections (SSIs) following craniectomies/craniotomies and open spinal surgery. The secondary aim was to assess differences in rates of SSI among these operative procedures.

Methods

ANOVA tests with Bonferroni correction and incidence risk ratios (RRs) were used to identify differences in pathogens by surgical site and procedure using retrospective, de-identified records of 19,993 postneurosurgical patients treated between 2007 and 2020.

Results

The overall infection rates for craniotomy/craniectomy, laminectomy, and fusion were 2.1%, 1.1%, and 1.5%, respectively, and overall infection rates for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine surgery were 0.3%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Craniotomy/craniectomy was more likely to result in an SSI than spine surgery (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4–2.2, p < 0.0001). Cutibacterium acnes (RR 24.2, 95% CI 7.3–80.0, p < 0.0001); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (methicillin-susceptible CoNS: RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6–5.4, p = 0.0006; methicillin-resistant CoNS: RR 5.6, 95% CI 1.4–22.3, p = 0.02); Klebsiella aerogenes (RR 6.5, 95% CI 1.7–25.1, p = 0.0003); Serratia marcescens (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1–7.1, p = 0.01); Enterobacter cloacae (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–8.1, p = 0.02); and Candida albicans (RR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2–12.3, p = 0.02) were more commonly associated with craniotomy/craniectomy cases than fusion or laminectomy SSIs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more commonly associated with fusion SSIs than craniotomy SSIs (RR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3–14.8, p = 0.02), whereas Escherichia coli was nonsignificantly associated with fusion SSIs compared to craniotomy SSIs (RR 4.1, 95% CI 0.9–18.1, p = 0.06). Infections with E. coli and P. aeruginosa occurred primarily in the lumbar spine (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions

SSIs due to typical gastrointestinal or genitourinary gram-negative bacteria occur most commonly following lumbar surgery, particularly fusion, and are likely to be due to contamination of the surgical bed with microbial flora in the perianal area and genitourinary tract. Cutibacterium acnes in the skin flora of the head and neck increases risk of infection due to this microbe following surgical interventions in these body sites. The types of gram-negative bacteria associated with craniotomy/craniectomy SSIs suggest potential environmental sources of these pathogens. Based on the authors' findings, neurosurgeons should consider using a two-step skin preparation with benzoyl peroxide, in addition to a standard antiseptic such as alcoholic chlorhexidine for cranial, cervical, and upper thoracic surgeries. Additionally, broader gram-negative bacterial coverage, such as use of a third-generation cephalosporin, should be considered for lumbar/lumbosacral fusion surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Outcomes of immediate titanium cranioplasty following post-craniotomy infection [^1162eqhr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

When craniotomy complicated by secondary infection requires debridement and craniectomy, the bony defect is typically not reconstructed immediately. Due to concerns about placing a prosthetic material in an infected field, cranioplasty has traditionally been delayed by weeks or months after craniectomy. However, surgeons have begun performing single-stage cranioplasty after craniectomy in an effort to reduce the morbidity associated with multiple procedures and reduce overall healthcare costs. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze outcomes of immediate cranioplasty performed after bone flap debridement secondary to infection. A literature review from January 1, 1998 through January 1, 2019 was conducted, examining the data on immediate titanium cranioplasty and its complication and reoperation rates. A meta-analysis of these articles was then performed. Variables studied included incidence of infection post-cranioplasty, wound healing complications, need for unplanned reoperation, and mortality. In total, there were 40 patients who underwent immediate cranioplasty after bone flap debridement. Overall, there was a 5% rate of postoperative infection, a 12.5% rate of unplanned return to the operating room, 7.5% rate of CSF fistula or leak, a 2.5% rate of hematoma, and a 2.5% rate of mortality within the immediate post-op period. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to rigorously compare these immediate cranioplasties in a direct way with the more traditional delayed type; the outcomes of immediate cranioplasty procedures secondary to craniectomy for infection were similar to the outcomes of delayed cranioplasty after craniectomy for any reason. Given these results, immediate titanium cranioplasty should be considered in select patients.

### Analysis of PMMA versus CaP titanium-enhanced implants for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: a retrospective observational cohort study [^115gdgXc]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and rational

Cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a neurosurgical procedure to repair resulting skull defects. Defect reconstruction was historically considered for cosmetic reasons More recent studies suggest a beneficial role for the patient's functional and neurological outcome. Both motor and cognitive functions improve after cranioplasty due to cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics and cerebral blood flow changes. Although the surgical procedure is relatively straightforward, it is associated with substantial cost and morbidity. Complications include post-operative bleeding, seizures, meningitis, surgical site infection (SSI), and bone flap resorption (BFR). Uncertainty persists regarding the implications of the timing of cranioplasty in terms of complication rates and potential benefits. Materials for reconstruction of cranial defect ideally provide osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties to promote structural and functional restoration. Autologous bone flap reinsertion is common after hemicraniectomy. Storage of the bone flap between craniectomy and cranioplasty is performed either intracorporeally (e.g. the patient's abdomen) or extracorporeally (i.e. by tissue banking). Furthermore alternative storage methods of extracorporeal preservation of the bone after sterilization in an autoclave or in ethylene oxide at room temperature have also been reported. Alloplastic materials, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyethylene, titanium, and injectable/moldable calcium phosphate-based bone cement have been used as alternatives. Risk factors for SSI, implant exposure, and graft removal after alloplastic cranioplasty include inaccurate matching and poor bone and soft tissue integration. In a large meta-analysis comparing different allografts, PEEK offers a low infection rate (5%; 95% CI 0–11) in 5 studies and is superior to autografts (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.07–0.57), hPMMA (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.07–0.60), Ti (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.17–0.92), and pPMMA (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.04–0.51). Infection occurred in 8% (95% CI 6–11) and implant exposure in 6% (95% CI 4–9). The stringency of data on the safety and complication rates of various materials used in cranioplasty is limited by a large diversity of study methods, clinical settings, and reported outcomes. Nonetheless, studies agree that the failure risk of autografts is higher than that of allografts.

### Cranioplasty using custom-made hydroxyapatite versus titanium: a randomized clinical trial [^113DG6q1]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Cranioplasty is routinely performed in neurosurgery. One of its underestimated problems is the high postoperative complication rate of up to 40%. Due to the lack of good prospective studies and the small number of patients (5–20 each year) who receive alloplastic materials, decisions in favor or against a certain material are based on subjective empirical or economic reasons. The main goal of this study-the first prospective, randomized multicenter study in Germany-of custom-made titanium and hydroxyapatite (HA) implants was to compare local and systemic infections related to the implant within the first 6 months after implantation. Secondary objectives included comparing the reoperation rate, the complication rate, clinical and neurological outcomes, and health-related quality of life. METHODS The study included patient screening and randomization at 6 to 8 weeks before operation; pre-, intra-, and postoperative documentation until discharge; and postoperative follow-ups after 1 and 6 months. Approval for the study was obtained from the local ethics committee. RESULTS A total of 52 patients were included in the study. The rate of local implant-associated wound infection in the HA group was 2 of 26 (7.7%) patients and 5 of 24 (20.8%) patients in the titanium group (p = 0.407). Systemic inflammation within 6 months after operation affected none of the patients in the HA group and 4 of 24 (37.5%) patients in the titanium group (p = 0.107). In both groups, 7 patients required reoperation after the 6-month follow-up (26.9% of the HA group and 29.2% of the titanium group; not significant). Reoperation with an explantation was necessary in 3 patients in each group (11.5% of the HA group and 12.5% of the titanium group; not significant). The results demonstrated a significantly higher number of epidural hematomas in the HA group in comparison with none in the titanium group. Altogether, 46 adverse events were found in 27 patients (54%). An improvement in the neurological outcome after 6 months was experienced by 43% of the patients in the HA group and 26.3% of the patients in the titanium group (p = 0.709). CONCLUSIONS The study emphasizes that cranioplasty is a high-risk intervention. In comparison with titanium, HA shows benefits in terms of the infection rate and the neurological outcome, but at the same time has a higher postoperative risk for epidural hematoma. Depending on the individual conditions, both materials have their place in future cranioplasty therapies. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT00923793 (clinicaltrials.gov).

Healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — CSF culture contamination and collection practices: The most common CSF contaminants are coagulase-negative staphylococci; in a pediatric daily-culture study more than half of positive cultures were thought to be contaminants, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolated in more than half of positive cultures, being considered a contaminant in 15 positive cultures and a true pathogen in only 3 cultures. Clues to contamination included light growth, growth only in enrichment broth, and growth in a minority of cultures, and all perceived true infections had fever and peripheral leukocytosis. When sampling from drainage devices, absence of changes in CSF cell count, glucose, or protein suggests contamination, and cultures should be obtained from the injection site/sampling port rather than a drainage bag; for lumbar drains, the sampling port is preferred.

### Aesthetic refinement of secondary cranioplasty using methyl methacrylate bone cements [^111ws3dQ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cranioplasty using alternate alloplastic bone substitutes instead of autologous bone grafting is inevitable in the clinical field. The authors present their experiences with cranial reshaping using methyl methacrylate (MMA) and describe technical tips that are keys to a successful procedure.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent cranioplasty with MMA between April 2007 and July 2010 was performed. For 20 patients, MMA was used for cranioplasty after craniofacial trauma (n = 16), tumor resection (n = 2), and a vascular procedure (n = 2). The patients were divided into two groups. In group 1, MMA was used in full-thickness inlay fashion (n = 3), and in group 2, MMA was applied in partial-thickness onlay fashion (n = 17). The locations of reconstruction included the frontotemporal region (n = 5), the frontoparietotemporal region (n = 5), the frontal region (n = 9), and the vertex region (n = 1). The size of cranioplasty varied from 30 to 144 cm².

Results

The amount of MMA used ranged from 20 to 70 g. This biomaterial was applied without difficulty, and no intraoperative complications were linked to the applied material. The patients were followed for 6 months to 4 years (mean, 2 years) after MMA implantation. None of the patients showed any evidence of implant infection, exposure, or extrusion. Moreover, the construct appeared to be structurally stable over time in all the patients.

Conclusions

Methyl methacrylate is a useful adjunct for treating deficiencies of the cranial skeleton. It provides rapid and reliable correction of bony defects and contour deformities. Although MMA is alloplastic, appropriate surgical procedures can avoid problems such as infection and extrusion. An acceptable overlying soft tissue envelope should be maintained together with minimal contamination of the operative site.

### Increased risk of surgical site infections with clindamycin prophylaxis in clean craniotomy [^115pe1Gd]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Postoperative central nervous system infections remain a major complication following craniotomy, with reported incidence ranging from 2.2% to 9.6%. The administration of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, particularly cephalosporins, has significantly reduced these infections. However, in patients reporting a penicillin allergy, alternatives such as vancomycin or clindamycin are recommended despite ongoing concerns about their efficacy. Recent studies have associated clindamycin use with a higher risk of surgical site infections (SSI) in various surgical specialties. This study aimed to assess clindamycin impact on SSI prevention in clean craniotomy.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted using a prospective surveillance database focused on SSI and antibiotic prophylaxis monitoring. Patients who underwent clean craniotomy between 2005 and 2020 were included. After univariate and multivariate analyses, we performed causal inference analysis with a propensity score matching to assess the excess risk of SSI.

Results

Among 12347 patients, 93.8% received cefazolin and 6.2% clindamycin. The overall SSI rate was 2.45%. Clindamycin use significantly increased SSI risk in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio adjusted: 2.52 [1.72–3.69]). The propensity score found increase of SSI rate (OR = 2.59 [1.71–3.94]) and of 90 days revision for infection (OR = 2.09 [1.23–3.54]). Other independent SSI risk factors included male sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3, prolonged surgery, specific surgical diagnoses, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which was the strongest predictor (aOR = 38.51 [25.24–59.30]). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Cutibacterium acnes (28.5%) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (24.5%). No significant differences were observed in bacterial distribution between antibiotic groups.

Conclusion

Clindamycin use is associated with an increased risk of SSI in clean craniotomy. Its bacteriostatic nature, and the proven safety of cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients support maintaining cefazolin as the preferred antibiotic for every clean craniotomy patient. The safety of modifying prophylaxis protocols should be prospectively evaluated to optimize postoperative infection prevention.

### Clinical and patient-reported outcome after patient-specific 3D printer-assisted cranioplasty [^111ZK8AB]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, in our series, 32.3% of patients underwent revision surgery due to a complication, most commonly an epidural hematoma/collection occurring in 16.1% of patients. Of these, two patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and one patient had known thrombocytopenia. These factors could have predisposed to the development of an epidural hematoma. This is comparable to published data where postoperative epidural hematoma, which had to be evacuated by revision surgery, occurred in 21.4% of patients. The second most common complication in our case series was an infection in 12.9% of patients. This is consistent with the literature, which reports an infection rate of 10–26% after cranioplasty. Epidural hematoma/collections and infections were most common in patients with frontotemporoparietal cranioplasty (36.9%). Among other factors, most probably the large wound area in frontotemporoparietal defects may favor the development of a postoperative epidural hematoma. In addition, all patients who underwent frontotemporoparietal cranioplasty had at least one previous operation at this site. This, in turn, leads to scar tissue with associated reduced tissue perfusion. Furthermore, in 45.2% of patients, the initial bone flap/cranioplasty was removed due to infection. This means that the same site was operated on at least twice in the case of an initial craniotomy, or three times in the case of an initial craniectomy. The number of previous surgeries is a known risk factor for surgical site infections and therefore might have contributed to the high infection rate in our study. Routinely, we expose the dura or neodura and place the implant into the bony defect. A study by Gordon et al. reports a technique where a vascularized pericranium flap is left on the dura and the implant is placed on it into the bony defect, providing a "vascularized sandwich" encasing and protecting the implant. With this technique, the authors report a low infection rate of 2.2%. However, the authors excluded smokers and patients with wound healing disorders; therefore, their infection rate is not comparable to ours. Reducing the complication rate in patients undergoing cranioplasty should be the focus of future interdisciplinary protocols and studies.

### Complications following pediatric cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: a multicenter retrospective study [^117AwRsX]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE In children, the repair of skull defects arising from decompressive craniectomy presents a unique set of challenges. Single-center studies have identified different risk factors for the common complications of cranioplasty resorption and infection. The goal of the present study was to determine the risk factors for bone resorption and infection after pediatric cranioplasty. METHODS The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective case study that included all patients who underwent cranioplasty to correct a skull defect arising from a decompressive craniectomy at 13 centers between 2000 and 2011 and were less than 19 years old at the time of cranioplasty. Prior systematic review of the literature along with expert opinion guided the selection of variables to be collected. These included: indication for craniectomy; history of abusive head trauma; method of bone storage; method of bone fixation; use of drains; size of bone graft; presence of other implants, including ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt; presence of fluid collections; age at craniectomy; and time between craniectomy and cranioplasty. RESULTS A total of 359 patients met the inclusion criteria. The patients' mean age was 8.4 years, and 51.5% were female. Thirty-eight cases (10.5%) were complicated by infection. In multivariate analysis, presence of a cranial implant (primarily VP shunt) (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.17–4.98), presence of gastrostomy (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.03–5.79), and ventilator dependence (OR 8.45, 95% CI 1.10–65.08) were significant risk factors for cranioplasty infection. No other variable was associated with infection. Of the 240 patients who underwent a cranioplasty with bone graft, 21.7% showed bone resorption significant enough to warrant repeat surgical intervention. The most important predictor of cranioplasty bone resorption was age at the time of cranioplasty. For every month of increased age the risk of bone flap resorption decreased by 1% (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–0.99, p < 0.001). Other risk factors for resorption in multivariate models were the use of external ventricular drains and lumbar shunts. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study of pediatric cranioplasty outcomes performed to date. Analysis included variables found to be significant in previous retrospective reports. Presence of a cranial implant such as VP shunt is the most significant risk factor for cranioplasty infection, whereas younger age at cranioplasty is the dominant risk factor for bone resorption.

Postoperative complications

Fig. 2
Postoperative complications after cranioplasty Implant explantations during follow-up (A). Survival analysis for explantation probability (B)

After explantation, less integration, as indicated by a clear, non-vascularized cleavage plain enabling easy removal was macroscopically observed in PMMA implants. In contrast, the CaP implant was firmly integrated in a vastly vascularized layer on both sides of surrounding tissue penetrating the implant. Integration in bioactive implants was pronounced with the surrounding tissue rendering the implant hard to separate from the elated skin necessitating sharp dissection. The CaP implants showed an outstanding anatomical matching in the osteoclastic defect in this series due to the possibility of intraoperative partial modeling (Fig. 3). MRI images 6 months after implantation showed good integration and vascularization of the covering skin flap (supplemental Fig. 1).

Fig. 3
CT scans (A) prior to the explantation of a bioactive ceramic implant due to contaminated atrophic skin lesion from pathological head posture leading (B). No bacterial infection was detected on the implant itself. The implant showed signs of strong osseointegration with the surrounding tissue (C)

In a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for follow-up time, sex, age, pre-operative mRS, and ASA grade, PMMA implants had a higher likelihood of removal (OR 3.12, 95% CI = 2.2–1914, p = 0.04).

A proportional hazard model was performed including the mentioned known risk factors such as mRS at admission, age, and ASA classification. Here, implant material (HR = 9.26, 95% CI = 1.09–233.9) and mRS > 3 (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.25–5.26) were predictive of increased implant removal.

### Lessons learned from using silicone implants in clean-contaminated regions of the face [^11651NJp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Augmentation rhinoplasty changes the shape of the nose using implanted material. In the 1980s, nasal implantology began to favor silicone over traditional autologous grafts because the synthetic material presented exciting benefits. However, long-term complications of nasal silicone implants have since emerged. This has necessitated the introduction of safe and effective materials. Despite an overwhelming transition to the use of improved implants, craniofacial surgeons will likely continue to see the consequences of silicone implant use as long-term complications arise in the innumerable patients who have had this procedure worldwide.

### Staged reconstruction of infected dura mater using vascularized rectus abdominis muscle [^113XMZgs]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Alloplastic synthetic dura is widely used in dura mater reconstruction. Although the incidence of postoperative alloplastic dura infection is not common, the possibility of intractable postoperative wound infection despite appropriate antibiotic use exists. Rectus free flap is composed of well-vascularized muscle and fascial tissues. This flap is appropriate for volumetric replacement in large defects, whereas the fascia is appropriate for dura mater reconstruction. We report a case of successful reconstruction in a patient who had intractable postsurgical wound infection with staged operation using vascularized rectus muscle and fascial flap in a patient with meningioma reconstructed with alloplastic dura graft (Neuropatch; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and additionally achieved aesthetic results. In the first step, vascularized rectus fascia and muscle were transferred to contaminated reconstructed dura after craniectomy. The removed calvarial bone was banked to the abdominal donor-site pocket after cleansing. Finally, in the second stage, cranioplasty was performed with the banked autologous calvarial bone.

### Timing of cranioplasty: a 10.75-year single-center analysis of 754 patients [^112jVCyY]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Despite their technical simplicity, cranioplasty procedures carry high reported morbidity rates. The authors here present the largest study to date on complications after cranioplasty, focusing specifically on the relationship between complications and timing of the operation. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all cranioplasty cases performed at Harborview Medical Center over the past 10.75 years. In addition to relevant clinical and demographic characteristics, patient morbidity and mortality data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to analyze variables potentially associated with the risk of infection, hydrocephalus, seizure, hematoma, and bone flap resorption. RESULTS Over the course of 10.75 years, 754 cranioplasties were performed at a single institution. Sixty percent of the patients who underwent these cranioplasties were male, and the median follow-up overall was 233 days. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.26% (2 cases, both due to postoperative epidural hematoma). Overall, 24.6% percent of the patients experienced at least 1 complication including infection necessitating explantation of the flap (6.6%), postoperative hydrocephalus requiring a shunt (9.0%), resorption of the flap requiring synthetic cranioplasty (6.3%), seizure (4.1%), postoperative hematoma requiring evacuation (2.3%), and other (1.6%). The rate of infection was significantly higher if the cranioplasty had been performed < 14 days after the initial craniectomy (p = 0.007, Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted p = 0.028). Hydrocephalus was significantly correlated with time to cranioplasty (OR 0.92 per 10-day increase, p < 0.001) and was most common in patients whose cranioplasty had been performed < 90 days after initial craniectomy. New-onset seizure, however, only occurred in patients who had undergone their cranioplasty > 90 days after initial craniectomy. Bone flap resorption was the least likely complication for patients whose cranioplasty had been performed between 15 and 30 days after initial craniectomy. Resorption was also correlated with patient age, with a hazard ratio of 0.67 per increase of 10 years of age (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Cranioplasty performed between 15 and 30 days after initial craniectomy may minimize infection, seizure, and bone flap resorption, whereas waiting > 90 days may minimize hydrocephalus but may increase the risk of seizure.

### The timing of alloplastic cranioplasty in the setting of previous osteomyelitis [^113ckgMq]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of cranial osteomyelitis is challenging and often includes débridement of infected bone and delayed alloplastic cranioplasty. However, the optimal interval between the removal of infected bone and definitive reconstruction remains controversial. The authors investigated the optimal time for definitive reconstruction and factors influencing cranioplasty reinfection.

Methods

A retrospective review of 111 alloplastic cranioplasties for osteomyelitis between 2002 and 2015 was performed. Patients were divided into four subgroups based on timing of reconstruction: group 1, less than 3 months; group 2, 3 to 6 months; group 3, 6 to 12 months; and group 4, more than 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the probability of cranioplasty reinfection based on risk factors. Median follow-up was 45.9 months (range, 12.4 to 136.9 months).

Results

The combined reinfection rate was 23.4 percent. The reinfection rate in group 1 was 39.6 percent; group 2, 12.5 percent; group 3, 8.0 percent; and group 4, 0.0 percent (p < 0.001). The mean interval between the infected bone removal and cranioplasty was shorter in patients with reinfection than in patients without reinfection (2.2 ± 3.9 months versus 6.1 ± 8.3 months; p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictors of reinfection were chemotherapy (OR, 10.1; 95 percent CI, 2.9 to 35.2), composite defect requiring scalp reconstruction at the time of cranioplasty (OR, 3.3; 95 percent CI, 1.2 to 8.9), and early reconstruction. Each month of delay in reconstruction reduced the reinfection rate by 10 percent (OR, 0.9 per each month of delay; 95 percent CI, 0.8 to 1.0). Cranioplasty material was not significant.

Conclusions

Early alloplastic cranioplasty following osteomyelitis carries an unacceptably high risk of reinfection. This risk decreases by 10 percent with each month of delay. The authors' regression model can be used to predict the probability of reinfection for all time periods.

### Exploring complications following cranioplasty after decompressive hemicraniectomy: a retrospective bicenter assessment of autologous, PMMA and CAD implants [^111tPK1s]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on our results, CP is still related to a relatively high number of infections and further postoperative complications. The choice of an implant material for cranioplasty seems to have a relevant impact on surgical complication rates. Especially PEEK and ABF seem to be associated with higher complication rates, in particular with SSI. On the other hand, surgical time, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy and hydrocephalus did not show a statistically significant association to postoperative complications in our study. More biocompatible implants such as CaP-Ti might be beneficial in terms of a reduced risk of postoperative complications. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to further investigate this matter.

### Exploring complications following cranioplasty after decompressive hemicraniectomy: a retrospective bicenter assessment of autologous, PMMA and CAD implants [^113pjrKR]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Complications related to implant materials

PEEK implants together with ABFs showed the highest rate of SSI. Similarly, PEEK implants were related to the highest rate of explantation. Revision surgery was most common after cranioplasty using ABFs followed by PEEK implants. In the literature, there are conflicting reports regarding cranioplasty with PEEK. In a meta-analysis from Henry et al. PEEK had the lowest infection rate with only 5% in 157 cases, compared to PMMA, HA and Ti. In another retrospective study, 12.5% of patients treated with PEEK implants suffered infection compared to 25% in Ti implants. Other authors report relative high explantation rates in association to PEEK. The overall complication rate of PEEK cranioplasty was 28% in a study from Jonkergouw et al. in 40 cases (13%) due to infection. An even higher infection rate (27.8%) is mentioned in a study from Rosinski et al. regarding custom PEEK implants compared to Ti implants. PEEK is a hydrophobic and bioinert material, so adhesion of osteoblasts to its surface and therefore osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are prevented. After surgery, the implant is not incorporated in the surrounding cranium bone. Furthermore, other authors stated that the lack of osseointegration in PEEK can lead to issues like implant migration and infection. It also needs to be noticed that our PEEK subgroup included the highest percentage of smokers (28.6%), patients unable to walk (82.9%) and of those treated with VP shunt prior to CP (48.6%) compared to the other subgroups excluding HA. These single features could be related to poor wound healing and thus contribute to the high rates of SSI and explantation in the PEEK subgroup, even though they were not significantly associated with any surgical complication in univariate analysis.

### Successful strategies for dealing with infected, custom-made hydroxyapatite cranioplasty [^116G4ceM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

When a cranioplasty implant becomes infected, standard operating procedure dictates its removal and the initiation of a long course of antibiotic therapy. However, removing such a prosthesis can have a series of adverse consequences, including delayed cognitive and motor recovery, lack of brain tissue protection, unsightly deformity, and the need for two additional surgical procedures, not to mention the additional costs involved. To maintain the advantages of cranioplasty, we opted for a conservative approach (levofloxacin and rifampicin every 24hours for 8 weeks) in a 68-year-old woman whose custom-made porous hydroxyapatite implant, fitted following aneurysm clipping, had become infected. The tissues overlying the implant were curettaged, and the patient's clinical condition, blood markers, and infection course were continuously monitored (local monitoring was performed by single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]/computed tomography [CT after intravenous administration of Tc-labeled antigranulocyte antibody). Blood tests and SPECT/CT evidenced a progressive reduction in phlogosis indices and infection locus, even 1 month after antibiotic therapy was commenced, and at 2 years from cranioplasty, the same tests and clinical examination were negative. At 6-year follow-up, clinical assessment revealed nothing out of the ordinary. Hence, specific cases (hydroxyapatite prosthesis, intact dura, cranial CT and magnetic resonance imaging negative for empyema, well-vascularized scalp, antibiotic-responsive bacteria) of infected cranial implant can be treated using a conservative approach consisting of appropriate antibiotic therapy, accompanied by local debridement where necessary, and assiduous monitoring of phlogosis indices and local verification via labeled-leukocyte scintigraphy. Our report, which was compiled after a long-term follow-up period, shows that this conservative procedure appears to be a viable option in cases of infected, custom-made hydroxyapatite cranioplasty, provided that some basic rules concerning clinical and instrumental standards are adhered to, as clearly stated in our report.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with surgical site infections after craniotomy or craniectomy [^112oFay3]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Many studies that have evaluated surgical site infections (SSIs) after craniotomy or craniectomy (CRANI) did not use robust methods to assess risk factors for SSIs or outcomes associated with SSIs. The authors conducted the current study to identify risk factors for SSIs after CRANI procedures and to evaluate outcomes attributed to SSIs.

Methods

The authors performed a nested case-control study of patients undergoing CRANI procedures between 2006 and 2010 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. They identified 104 patients with SSIs and selected 312 controls. They collected data from medical records and used multivariate analyses to identify risk factors and outcomes associated with SSIs.

Results

Thirty-two percent of SSIs were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, 88% were deep incisional or organ space infections, and 70% were identified after discharge. Preoperative length of stay (LOS) ≥ 1 day was the only significant patient-related factor in the preoperative model (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.2–3.4]) and in the overall model (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.1–3.3]). Procedure-related risk factors that were significant in the overall model included Gliadel wafer use (OR 6.7 [95% CI 2.5–18.2]) and postoperative CSF leak (OR 3.5 [95% CI 1.4–8.5]). The preoperative SSI risk index, including body mass index, previous brain operation, chemotherapy on admission, preoperative LOS, procedure reason, and preoperative glucose level, had better predictive efficacy (c-statistic = 0.664) than the National Healthcare Safety Network risk index (c-statistic = 0.547; p = 0.004). Surgical site infections were associated with increased LOS during the initial hospitalizations (average increase of 50%) or readmissions (average increase of 100%) and with an increased risk of readmissions (OR 7.7 [95% CI 4.0–14.9]), reoperations (OR 36 [95% CI 14.9–87]), and death (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5–7.4]).

Conclusions

Surgeons were able to prospectively assess a patient's risk of SSI based on preoperative risk factors and they could modify some processes of care to lower the risk of SSI. Surgical site infections substantially worsened patients' outcomes. Preventing SSIs after CRANI could improve patient outcomes and decrease health care utilization.

### Risk factors for pediatric surgical site infection following neurosurgical procedures for hydrocephalus: a retrospective single-center cohort study [^112vocxw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common bacteria detected in our cohort were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes, generally consistent with previous reports. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in a smaller proportion of cases. While the effectiveness of antimicrobial-impregnated and -coated shunts (AIS) has been described, there are concerns including the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and resistant gram negative rods (GNR) with repeated use. Although we routinely use antimicrobial impregnated shunting, MRSA was not detected in our cohort.

Our study has several limitations. First, it was limited as a single-center study and was retrospective. Second, the low SSI rate and small sample size may impair statistical power to find associations.

In conclusion, we have shown that receipt of clindamycin as prophylaxis was significantly associated with SSI in children undergoing shunt surgery. Because unsubstantiated allergy labeling for penicillin and other antibiotics are common in surgical patients, efforts should be made to identify which patients can successfully receive a beta-lactam antibiotic for perioperative prophylaxis. Further research is needed to better define the mechanism by which cardiac disease is associated with SSI among patients undergoing neurosurgical shunt procedures.

### Infections in patients undergoing craniotomy: risk factors associated with post-craniotomy meningitis [^112sQg5D]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT The authors performed a prospective study to define the prevalence and microbiological characteristics of infections in patients undergoing craniotomy and to clarify the risk factors for post-craniotomy meningitis. METHODS Patients older than 18 years who underwent nonstereotactic craniotomies between January 2006 and December 2008 were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were systemically recorded. Patient characteristics, craniotomy type, and pre- and postoperative variables were evaluated as risk factors for meningitis RESULTS Three hundred thirty-four procedures were analyzed (65.6% involving male patients). Traumatic brain injury was the most common reason for craniotomy. Almost 40% of the patients developed at least 1 infection. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the most common infection recorded (22.5%) and Acinetobacter spp. were isolated in 44% of the cases. Meningitis was encountered in 16 procedures (4.8%), and CSF cultures were positive for microbial growth in 100% of these cases. Gram-negative pathogens (Acinetobacter spp. Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloaceae, Proteus mirabilis) represented 88% of the pathogens. Acinetobacter and Klebsiella spp. demonstrated a high percentage of resistance in several antibiotic classes. In multivariate analysis, the risk for meningitis was independently associated with perioperative steroid use (OR 11.55, p = 0.005), CSF leak (OR 48.03, p < 0.001), and ventricular drainage (OR 70.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Device-related postoperative communication between the CSF and the environment, CSF leak, and perioperative steroid use were defined as risk factors for meningitis in this study. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common infection overall. The offending pathogens presented a high level of resistance to several antibiotics.

### Vancomycin ointment for MRSA infection at a cranioplasty site [^114oDC1M]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case illustrating therapeutic success with long-term topical application of aseptic vancomycin ointment to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection at a cranioplasty site.

Case Summary

A 63-year-old Japanese woman underwent evacuation of a subdural hematoma complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subsequent craniotomy for clipping and external decompression of an aneurysm of the neck was followed by cranioplasty using an autologous bone graft. The graft became infected with MRSA, which responded to intravenously infused vancomycin. The graft was then replaced with a ceramic implant. The implant site became reinfected with MRSA. Vancomycin infusion failed on this occasion, despite a favorable in vitro sensitivity test. After obtaining patient consent, investigative treatment was begun using long-term aseptic application of vancomycin 2.5% ointment, resulting in control of the infection and negative cultures.

Discussion

The care of an infection at the site of cranioplasty with a ceramic artificial bone implant is difficult. Our patient's infection resolved with the use of vancomycin ointment. In this case, blood concentrations of vancomycin remained below detectable levels, and no adverse effects resulted from application of vancomycin ointment.

Conclusions

Topical administration of vancomycin was more effective than systemic administration in the treatment of our patient's MRSA skull implant infection. No adverse effects from topical treatment were encountered over 3 years.

### Long-term complications and implant survival rates after cranioplastic surgery: a single-center study of 392 patients [^1161Fs5h]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

MDRB

The impact of MDRB on complication rates seems plausible as colonization with these microorganisms has to be considered a co-marker of severe morbidity. Although data on neurosurgical interventions are not available, neurological and geriatric patients have a higher risk (up to 22.7%) of MDRB colonization. Furthermore, MDRBs are associated with overall higher hospital costs, significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, as well as increased morbidity and mortality in orthopedic and cardiologic patients.

CP fixation

The use of the CP fixation material seems to have an impact on postoperative complication rates. We demonstrate that titanium miniplates significantly reduced the risk of overall postoperative complications as well as bone flap osteolysis compared with the use of autologous implants. Furthermore, overall implant survival time was significantly longer. Other studies reported similar results with an advantage of titanium plates. In addition, a recent study ﻿demonstrated a higher rate of successful bone fusion in cases in which plates and screws were used. Furthermore, the authors showed that bone resorption was considered to occur in a solitary bone flap without bone fusion or in portions of the bone flap far away from the fusion site. These findings underline our assumption that a superior bone fusion is associated with a lower rate of bone flap autolysis and loosening. Therefore, the use of miniplates for CP fixation seems to be associated with a lower risk of bone flap autolysis.

CP timing

Further risk factors for CP complications include timing of CP (early vs. late) and the type of implant material. In this study, we did not find any significant relation between certain timeframes and increased complication rates. Nevertheless, further regression analysis showed that an early CP (< 30 days after craniectomy) was an independent risk factor for a decreased implant survival. Previous studies have reported that early CP surgery (< 90 days) is associated with an increase odd of hydrocephalus and﻿ highest risk of infection within 14 days of initial craniectomy, whereas CP between 15 and 30 days ﻿minimizes risk of infection, seizure, and autologous flap resorption.

### Outcomes of calvarial reconstruction in cancer patients [^112Xfhwz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on outcomes of calvarial reconstruction in cancer patients, including the relative efficacy of various cranioplasty materials, and risk factors for complications.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of cancer patients who underwent calvarial reconstruction over a 12-year period.

Results

A total of 269 patients underwent 289 calvarial reconstructions. Materials used for cranioplasty included titanium mesh (49.8 percent), methylmethacrylate (16.3 percent), porous polyethylene (4.8 percent), polyetheretherketone (4.5 percent), calcium phosphate cement (3.8 percent), autologous bone grafts (2.1 percent), or a combination of materials (18.3 percent). Perioperative (≤ 30 days after surgery) complications occurred in 42 cases (14.5 percent), of which 29 (10.0 percent) were at the recipient site, most commonly infection (2.8 percent) and cerebrospinal fluid leak (2.4 percent). Risk factors for perioperative complications included radiation therapy (p = 0.012), prior surgery (p = 0.003), and prior infection (p = 0.014). Late recipient-site complications (> 30 days after surgery) occurred in 20 cases (6.9 percent), including infection (3.8 percent) and wound dehiscence (3.1 percent), and for which radiation therapy was identified as a risk factor (p = 0.011). The use of calcium phosphate cement in combination with titanium mesh was associated with a higher long-term complication rate (p < 0.001). Twenty-five cases (8.7 percent) required cranioplasty removal, with infection and dehiscence being risk factors for implant loss (p < 0.001 for both).

Conclusions

Alloplastic cranioplasty is effective in cancer patients with calvarial defects. Commonly used materials have similar complication profiles, with the possible exception of calcium phosphate cement, which is associated with a higher rate of complications when combined with titanium mesh and used to reconstruct larger defects.

### Complications of cranioplasty [^116zFdQs]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cranioplasty is a time-honoured surgical procedure to restore the calvarial form and function that is associated with a relatively high complication rate. The present article analyzed various complications and reviewed the complications based on study of the relevant research in the craniofacial literature. Complications were broadly divided into 2 groups, intraoperative and postoperative, for ease of understanding. The etiological factors, local and systemic condition of the patient, prevention, and management of various complications were widely discussed. The article also highlighted problems and complications associated with various reconstructive materials. Insights into various complications of cranioplasty enable surgeon to understand them better, minimize the chances of occurrence, and improve surgical outcome. In spite of reported high rate of complications, serious complications like meningitis, air embolism, and death are rare.

### First-in-human experience with integration of a hydrocephalus shunt device within a customized cranial implant [^117FjsUa]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

For instance, the relentless pressure from underneath the scalp leads to tissue necrosis in a manner quite similar to sacral pressure ulcers commonly seen by plastic surgery. Essentially, the necrotic wound begins at the deepest aspect — closest to the source, since its etiology relates directly to pressure and is invisible to the human eye. In the case of hydrocephalus, the rigid structure is the high-profile shunt valve causing an unbalanced pressure from within, similar to the bony prominence causing the constant pressure in the debilitated, bed-ridden patient. As such, the pressure-induced tissue necrosis from the high-profile shunt valve device leads to the unforeseen formation of an open scalp wound (Figure 1). From there, the shunt hardware becomes exposed and bacterial contamination/biofilm formation is unpreventable and equates to eventual hardware removal.

FIGURE 1.
Preoperative photograph of inaugural patient presenting to neuroplastic surgery clinic with, left-sided scalp wound and extruding shunt valve. One can appreciate the high-profile shunt's visible deformity (represented by dotted black line), as well as the exposed valve (red arrow).

Unfortunately, for shunt-dependent patients with severe hydrocephalus, shunt exposure is a major setback. It necessitates an admission to the neurological intensive care unit with temporary external ventricular drainage. The duration of external ventricular drainage often ranges from 7 to 14 d and includes culture-directed intravenous antibiotics followed by secondary insertion of a new internalized shunt device. As such, for these complex patients who present with shunt valve extrusion/exposure necessitating removal, most would agree that every effort should be made at time of shunt valve replacement to prevent the scalp-related complication from occurring again.

### Long-term clinical outcome analysis of poly-methyl-methacrylate cranioplasty for large skull defects [^112F9Fp2]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of secondary cranioplasty is permanent cerebral protection in an esthetically acceptable fashion. Reconstruction of cranial defects can be performed with several different materials. Alloplastic materials, such as preformed methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) cranioplasties, are an alternative frequently used at our institution. This retrospective analysis was designed to review the outcomes of PMMA cranioplasty for skull defect reconstruction.

Materials and Methods

Seventy consecutive patients who had 78 PMMA cranioplasties placed from 2003 through 2010 were identified. Mechanism of injury, location of cranioplasty, type of original repair, postoperative complications, and follow-up time were reviewed.

Results

Of the 70 patients, 6 patients had failure and removal of their original PMMA cranioplasty and reinsertion of another, and 2 patients had failure and removal of 2 cranioplasties with replacement of a third, creating a total of 78 PMMA cranioplasties placed. The predominant mechanism of injury was trauma (64%). The most frequent postoperative complication was infection (13%). With the exception of the 2 patients with implant exposure, no patients reported an unacceptable cosmetic result. An overall complication rate of 24% was seen.

Conclusions

The results of previous studies have shown that infection and complication rates of cranioplasties accomplished with bone cement are substantially higher, that titanium-based implants may obscure follow-up imaging for tumor patients, and that the outcomes regarding hydroxyapatite-based ceramics, although similar to PMMA, are associated with a much higher cost. PMMA remains a cost-effective and proven method to repair cranial defects that fulfills the goals of cranial reconstruction for skull defects.

Healthcare-associated fungal ventriculitis and meningitis — epidemiology and outbreaks: Fungal disease is much less common than bacterial and may follow surgery, invasive procedures, or trauma; in the post-operative setting, Candida species are the most likely pathogen and have been implicated in premature infants and in 5% of cases following neurosurgery. In oncology patients between 1973 and 2004, 7% were infected with C. neoformans and 1% with Candida albicans, and 78% had prior neurosurgery. A multistate fungal meningitis outbreak in September 2012 from contaminated methylprednisolone produced infections in which the index patient had Aspergillus fumigatus but most subsequent infections were due to Exserohilum rostratum; of 749 patients with infections, meningitis occurred in 233 (31%), and another 151 patients (20%) had meningitis with a concurrent spinal or paraspinal infection.

### Exploring complications following cranioplasty after decompressive hemicraniectomy: a retrospective bicenter assessment of autologous, PMMA and CAD implants [^111nQ5TF]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

In our whole study population, PMMA followed by CaP-Ti implants had the lowest SSI, explantation and revision surgery rates in comparison to other cranioplasty materials. In a large retrospective series with 139 patients receiving PMMA, infection rate was very high with 42.5%. In another study, revision surgery for PMMA was 22.9%. As described before, reported differences in CP materials were often contradicted by other studies.

Our two centers used to perform CP with PMMA implants during the earlier years considered for this data collection, while custom-made implants were introduced more recently in our clinical practice. Thus, the longer experience with PMMA might explain the relatively low complication rate in our study. Furthermore, median time to CP was the lowest for PMMA implants (94 days) compared to the other subgroups. Earlier cranioplasty has been suggested as a potential factor reducing postoperative complications in previous works.

### Extensive convexity flattening of a synthetic skull implant the overcome major scalp deficiency after multiple craniotomies [^114qX25n]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Quite a frequent problem in neurosurgery is that wound edges are often under significant tension, and therefore, difficult to readapt for primary wound closure following craniectomy and cranioplasty. This problem is often due to scalp tissue shrinkage and volume contraction, and subgaleal dissection techniques to reduce skin tension can compromise the vascularity of the skin edges, thereby impairing wound healing. In addition, despite of the implementation of infection prevention bundles in our hospital, infection is common and necessitates multiple operations that end up requiring custom made implants due to autologous bone involvement. Thereby, the most challenging aspect comprises of the significant scalp shrinkage and volume contraction during the different time intervals required to allow for adequate recovery from the prior infections. Furthermore, any secondary surgical procedure is accompanied by an increased rate of postoperative infections, as technical challenges of operating in a scarred scalp area increases. In addition, complex secondary reconstructive procedures without a plastic surgeon might increase the risk of complications and subsequent infections. In the setting of highly complex scalp reconstruction with simultaneous cranioplasty, Wolff et alreported on a simple technique using full-thickness skin grafting to cover local defects in order to obtain scalp closure in a tension free manner. This technique represents a valuable option improving aesthetic outcome, which was less favorable in our patient. In addition, Cabbad et alreported on their experiences of covering skull defects using split rib grafts, iliac graft, or split cranial bone from the contralateral side when the implantation of the autologous bone flap was not feasible, thus reducing the infection rates associated with customized implants. In view of their results, a split cranial bone graft from the contralateral side might have been an alternative option given the extension of the craniectomy to cover up. Despite alloplastic implants are mostly safe and offer good cosmetic outcomes when autologous bone implantation is not feasible, their application can be limited. Alternatively, free hand molding of polymethylmethacrylate implants harbor less acceptable cosmetic results, wherefore novels methods to develop 3D-printer-assisted methods are increasingly used. However, side effects of polymethylmethacrylate such as allergic reactions, or exothermic injuries have been described. On the other hand, titanium meshes have been associated with significant less infection rates compared to other custom implants, yet postsurgical discomfort including an unfavorable cosmetic outcome in large and complex defects might limits its application in selected patients. To reduce scalp volume contraction, early cranioplasty might be considered. In case of an infection, however, its application is limited. Also, few studies report on the use of scalp tissue expansion before cranioplasty in selected cases. Nonetheless, tissue expansion has to be performed before the cranioplasty and thus is limited in patients with infected bone flap. Further disadvantages of external tissue expansion is that, despite of its high costs, it yields only moderate area increase. Although there is no consensus in the guidelines for the repair of these complex cranial reconstructions when in situ infection is encountered, curvature flatting has been shown to harbor has lower complication rate and is less invasive.

### Analysis of PMMA versus CaP titanium-enhanced implants for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy: a retrospective observational cohort study [^1141RUun]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

The optimal timing of cranioplasty to minimize complications has yet to be established. Some favor early (within 12 weeks) and ultra-early (within 4 weeks) cranioplasty. Early cranioplasty has been associated with lower infection rates and lower probability of developing hydrocephalus, although some authors reported that timing had no influence and have observed similar SSI numbers. In our study, cranioplasty was performed at 122.2 ± 96 days after DC. The time span did not differ between both groups. Continued research will show if the timing of cranioplasty should be adapted to the chosen implant material.

Titanium-enhanced biocompatible CaP implants comprise a ceramic compound containing monetite, β-calcium pyrophosphate (PPi), β-tricalcium phosphate, and brushite. These ceramics have chemical resemblance to the osteoconductive and osteoinductive elements in native bone. While osseointegration has been defined as load-bearing integration without loosening, osteoconduction facilitates bone growth on a particular surface, and osteoinduction encompasses processes leading to the differentiation of undifferentiated osteoprogenitor cells to osteoblasts. Gene expression analysis in bioactive CaP implants has detected osteoblastic activity and bone formation at 9 months after cranioplasty. In large animal models, bioactive ceramics are better promoters of bone formation, remodeling, and osseointegration than titanium implants. Similar properties such as osteoconductive properties, with a high degree of tissue ingrowth and vascularization, have long been associated with HA implants. We found that the integration of the bioactive ceramic implant as seen in one patient after explantation proved superior to PMMA implants. This observation adds proof to the previously published in vitro and animal data. Only 1 patient required explantation of the bioactive ceramic implant. Osseointegration is also observed with PMMA in animal models. However, it is much less pronounced and matter of ongoing research using different porosities and additives such as strontium containing borate bioactive glass to improve upon this property. As HA and CaP implants share similar properties, it seems plausible that improved integration and lower SSI rates have been observed in a prospective randomized trial. Much is yet to be learned about the safety and efficacy of bioactive CaP, among others, as cranioplasty implant materials. Specific advantages and disadvantages compared to biocompatible or alloplastic materials will have to be determined over time. Despite the early paucity in literature, PEEK cranioplasty seems to be associated with lower post-operative complication rates compared to PMMA, titanium, and autografts. Nevertheless, compared to titanium mesh implants, infection rates are high among patients receiving custom PEEK implants. Previous studies indicate that infection and complication rates in cranioplasty with bone cement are substantially higher, while titanium-based implants impair follow-up imaging. We observed no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications such as hemorrhage, CSF fistulas, and seizures. However, the necessity for explanation of PMMA implants was higher in the entire cohort, as well as in a subgroup analysis with a given 1-year follow-up. Surgical site infection and wound dehiscence were the main reasons for implant removal in the PMMA group (6 out of 43 patients, 13.95%). This observation falls in line with previously published data reporting postoperative infection rates using PMMA implants of 14.4% < 3 months and 28.1% > 3 months, respectively. As there is currently no other published literature comparing bioactive CaP implants with alloplastic materials, it remains to be seen how these implants will ultimately reduce complication and implant failure rates and improve clinical outcomes. Prospective clinical trials in this field are difficult to establish due to a tremendous variability of techniques and applied materials. This is also confirmed by the small number of prospective clinical trials performed to date. However, prospective registries (e.g. German Cranial Reconstruction Registry) bear the potential of longitudinal multicentric analyses with homogenous datasets. First data from the Multicenter Prospective Registry of Cranioplasty in the UK and Ireland offers insights into international variation in practice. Here, the most common material used was titanium (64%) followed by autologous implants (14%). The median time to cranioplasty was higher compared to our cohort with about 244 days. The authors report a 30 days readmission rate of 5.5% with 4% being due to SSI. This is almost identical to the observations made in this study, with 4 out of 10 readmissions occurred within 30 days and all being due to SSI. However, the Registry of Cranioplasty in the UK and Ireland does no offer insight into differences between PMMA and CaP implants. It remains to be seen, if similar rates of re-admission and revision surgery become evident once data on longer follow-up intervals is available.

### Analysis of the factors influencing bone graft infection after cranioplasty [^113Dxo53]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy was performed using various reconstruction materials and methods. Bone graft infection is a major concern with cranioplasty. This study identified factors that are related to bone graft infection after cranioplasty.

Methods

A total of 140 patients underwent reconstructive cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy between 2000 and 2009. The sample population included 102 male patients and 39 female patients aged 6 years to 76 years, with a mean age of 47.5 years. Autografts were used for cranioplasty when available. Polymethylmethacrylate or customized linear high-density polyethylene was considered when autografts were unavailable. Bone graft infection was defined as the removal of the infected bone graft, and the related factors were evaluated retrospectively.

Results

Bone graft infection occurred in 11 patients (7.86%). Bone graft infection after cranioplasty was significantly related to the number of operations (p = 0.002), operation time (p = 0.031), and diabetes (p = 0.004). An increased number of operations increased the infection rate from 4.3% to 33%. Infection rates increased rapidly after three times. The infection rate was less than 10% when cranioplasty was completed within 199 minutes. An infection rate greater than 20% was observed when cranioplasty required more than 200 minutes. Other factors, such as graft material, fixation devices, age, sex, the cause of the operation, the interval between craniectomy and cranioplasty, and underlying nondiabetic diseases, did not significantly alter the infection rate.

Conclusion

Short surgical times (< 200 minutes) and a lower number of previous operations (less than three times) may decrease the risk of bone flap infection. Careful attention is required when performing cranioplasty, particularly in patients with diabetes.

External ventricular drains — ventriculitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection rates and risk factors are summarized as follows: in patients with external ventricular drains, the incidence of ventriculitis has ranged from 0% to 22%. A large metaanalysis reported an overall pooled incidence of external ventricular drain–related CSF infection of 11.4 per 1000 catheter-days (95% confidence interval, 9.3–13.5), with high-quality studies showing 10.6 per 1000 catheter-days (95% CI, 8.3–13). Factors associated with an increased risk of infection are intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage, cranial fracture with CSF leak, catheter irrigation, craniotomy, and duration of catheterization, and most studies consider extended catheter duration (usually exceeding 5 days) to be an important risk factor for subsequent infection. Reported rates by duration include an overall external ventricular drain infection rate of 19.6 per 1000 catheter-days, 12.8 per 1000 catheter-days for drains in place for 7–10 days, and 8 per 1000 catheter-days for drains in place for more than 10 days.

### Acute autologous bone flap infection after cranioplasty for postinjury decompressive craniectomy [^115cigGy]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bone flap infection is a devastating complication after cranioplasty for postinjury decompressive craniectomy. We aim to identify the risk factors of autologous bone flap infection.

Methods

We enrolled 151 patients undergoing 153 cranioplasties in the 4-year retrospective study. Autologous bones stored at -75°C were used in the cranioplasties. Acute bone flap infection was defined as the onset of infection ≤ 14 days after cranioplasty. The epidemiological data of patients and details of the cranioplasty procedure were recorded.

Results

Acute bone flap infection was identified in five of the 153 cranioplasties, accounting for 3.3% of all episodes. Three of the 5 infected patients and five of 143 uninfected patients presented with dysfunction of subgaleal drainage comparatively, which was significantly different (p = 0.001). Statistical analysis of the cranioplasty procedures and subsequent results of the two patient groups revealed the following significant findings: the duration of operation (p = 0.03) and the length of hospital stay after cranioplasty (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Dysfunction of subgaleal drainage and long operative duration of cranioplasty are risk factors of acute autologous bone flap infection. Regarding the prolonged hospital stay in complicated patients, better surgical techniques should be implemented in order to eliminate the risks of infection.

### Complications of cranioplasty in relationship to traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Snuij]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

DC is an effective means to control ICP and mitigate the risk of herniation in patients with cerebral edema resulting from a wide range of conditions, and subsequent CP is crucial to restore cranial integrity and prevent SSFS. However, while those procedures are technically straightforward, they place the patient at risk for many nontrivial complications, which can negatively impact outcome.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the difference in complication rates after CP following DC, for TBI and all other indications considered together. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in the overall complication rates between the two groups. However, when we analyzed specific complications separately, we found a significant increase in odds of autologous bone flap resorption and of infection in TBI patients. We hope that our findings will increase the awareness to these specific complications and promote the development of new strategies to decrease the risk of such complications, which may significantly compromise the already difficult pathway to recovery of trauma patients, even at advanced stages of healing.

Furthermore, as numbers of DC and CP continue to rise, it will become increasingly important to be aware of the actual risk of complications encountered by specific patient populations. Neurosurgeons, neurologists, and patients will need to know the risks of the procedure to be able to make informed decisions and develop new protocols to prevent those complications.

### Current indications for surgical intervention with lateral skull base osteomyelitis [^1113i39H]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BEST PRACTICE SUMMARY

Key management principles of SBO include aggressive diabetes control, reversal of immunocompromised states, and prolonged antibiotics with anti‐pseudomonal coverage. When it comes to contemporary indications for surgical intervention, failure of medical management has the strongest justification; however, the definition of "medical failure" and the type of surgeries indicated in these circumstances are not well defined. Surgical cultures do not typically yield pathogen data that leads to a change in antibiotic regime, therefore the utility of surgery solely for the purpose of obtaining deeper cultures may be limited. There may be a role for surgery in the setting of aggressive features such as facial palsy and fungal involvement, however, the benefits have not been clearly demonstrated based on currently available data.

### Role of biofilms in neurosurgical device-related infections [^1112GCrx]. Neurosurgical Review (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial biofilms have recently been shown to be important in neurosurgical device-related infections. Because the concept of biofilms is novel to most practitioners, it is important to understand that both traditional pharmaceutical therapies and host defense mechanisms that are aimed at treating or overcoming free-swimming bacteria are largely ineffective against the sessile bacteria in a biofilm. Bacterial biofilms are complex surface-attached structures that are composed of an extruded extracellular matrix in which the individual bacteria are embedded. Superimposed on this physical architecture is a complex system of intercellular signaling, termed quorum sensing. These complex organizational features endow biofilms with numerous microenvironments and a concomitant number of distinct bacterial phenotypes. Each of the bacterial phenotypes within the biofilm displays a unique gene expression pattern tied to nutrient availability and waste transport. Such diversity provides the biofilm as a whole with an enormous survival advantage when compared to the individual component bacterial cells. Thus, it is appropriate to view the biofilm as a multicellular organism, akin to metazoan eukaryotic life. Bacterial biofilms are much hardier than free floating or planktonic bacteria and are primarily responsible for device-related infections. Now that basic research has demonstrated that the vast majority of bacteria exist in biofilms, the paradigm of biofilm-associated chronic infections is spreading to the clinical world. Understanding how these biofilm infections affect patients with neurosurgical devices is a prerequisite to developing strategies for their treatment and prevention.

### Spinal and paraspinal infections associated with contaminated methylprednisolone acetate injections-Michigan, 2012–2013 [^111dwcBj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is known on this topic?

The 2012–2013 outbreak of fungal meningitis and associated localized spinal or paraspinal infections was caused by contaminated methylprednisolone acetate injections manufactured by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts. Exserohilum rostratum, a common black mold found on plants and in soil, remains the most common cause of infection nationally.

What is added by this report?

As of May 6, 2013, Michigan had reported 167 (52%) of the 320 spinal or paraspinal infections without meningitis associated with the outbreak nationwide. Analysis of the Michigan cases did not find a distinct epidemiologic or clinical difference between patients with paraspinal and spinal infections with meningitis and patients with paraspinal and spinal infections without meningitis. Additionally, the findings indicated a wide range (12–121 days) in the number of days from the last injection with contaminated MPA to the first MRI finding indicative of infection. Finally, no correlation was found between the number of injections of contaminated MPA received by patients and the likelihood of infection.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Patients with diagnosed spinal or paraspinal infections might not have signs and symptoms greater than their baseline levels, and the lack of a gold standard in diagnosing fungal infection in such patients might present a challenge. Clinicians should be aware that some infections have surfaced long after the contaminated injections and, therefore, a higher index of suspicion for patients who received injections with contaminated MPA should be maintained.

This outbreak has presented multiple challenges, including unknown incubation periods, a broader spectrum of clinical presentations than initially anticipated, latent disease, and a wide range in the number of days from the last contaminated injection to the first positive MRI finding, especially among patients with spinal or paraspinal infections without meningitis. Expanded MRI screening efforts might lead to additional diagnoses and improve case ascertainment, but such efforts should be considered along with the unknown balance of risks and benefits in treating patients on the basis of MRI findings alone.

### Cranioplasty outcomes from 500 consecutive neuroplastic surgery patients [^115G5UE7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cranioplasty is critical to cerebral protection and restoring intracranial physiology, yet this procedure is fraught with a high risk of complications. The field of neuroplastic surgery was created to improve skull and scalp reconstruction outcomes in adult neurosurgical patients, with the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team approach could help decrease complications.

Objective

To determine outcomes from a cohort of cranioplasty surgeries performed by a neuroplastic surgery team using a consistent surgical technique and approach.

Methods

The authors reviewed 500 consecutive adult neuroplastic surgery cranioplasties that were performed between January 2012 and September 2020. Data were abstracted from a prospectively maintained database. Univariate analysis was performed to determine association between demographic, medical, and surgical factors and odds of revision surgery.

Results

Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. Overall, there was a reoperation rate of 15.2% (n = 76), with the most frequent complications being infection (7.8%, n = 39), epidural hematoma (2.2%, n = 11), and wound dehiscence (1.8%, n = 9). New onset seizures occurred in 6 (1.2%) patients. Several variables were associated with increased odds of revision surgery, including lower body mass ratio, 2 or more cranial surgeries, presence of hydrocephalus shunts, scalp tissue defects, large-sized skull defect, and autologous bone flaps. importantly, implants with embedded neurotechnology were not associated with increased odds of reoperation.

Conclusions

These results allow for comparison of multiple factors that impact risk of complications after cranioplasty and lay the foundation for development of a cranioplasty risk stratification scheme. Further research in neuroplastic surgery is warranted to examine how designated centers concentrating on adult neuro-cranial reconstruction and multidisciplinary collaboration may lead to improved cranioplasty outcomes and decreased risks of complications in neurosurgical patients.

### Use of stock titanium mesh plates in cranioplasty [^112TbDeQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Craniofacial surgeons are often confronted with major defects of the calvarium. These most commonly are post-traumatic but could also be consequent upon neurosurgical procedures, infection, or tumor removal. There are several options available to reconstruct these defects including autogenous, heterogeneous, and alloplastic material. The goal is to have a method that is easy, cost-effective, with minimal complications, and long-lasting. In our unit we review 100 cases of the use of stock titanium mesh during a 5-year period. Complications occurred in 5 patients (5%) with 3 exposures, 1 late seroma and 1 case requiring repositioning of the plate following trauma. None of the patients required removal of the plate.

### Risk factors associated with postcraniotomy meningitis [^111iDSsJ]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence, bacteriological features, and risk factors for postcraniotomy meningitis.

Methods

Patients older than 18 years who underwent nonstereotactic craniotomies between January 1996 and March 2000 and who survived for more than 7 days were included. Operations for placement of burr holes and shunts were excluded. Records of the first 30 postoperative days were abstracted. Host factors, types of craniotomy, and pre- and postoperative variables were evaluated as risk factors for meningitis

Results

Among 453 patients, there were 25 cases of meningitis. Eight out of 12 culture-positive cases were the result of gram-positive cocci. Four hundred twenty (92%) patients received antibiotic prophylaxis, most commonly a first-generation cephalosporin. In multivariate analysis, the risk of meningitis was increased by surgery that entered a sinus (odds ratio [OR], 4.49; P = 0.018), an increase in the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (OR, 1.72; P = 0.023), and increases in the number of days of external ventricular drainage (OR, 1.21; P = 0.049) and intracranial pressure monitoring (OR, 1.24; P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Access of upper airway bacteria to the surgical wound, host factors as expressed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and duration of device-related postoperative communication of the cerebrospinal fluid and the environment are major risk factors for postoperative meningitis after craniotomy.
