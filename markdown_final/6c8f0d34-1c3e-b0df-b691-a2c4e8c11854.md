## Question

what is a versajet?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a VersaJet is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the device components and how it is used clinically. Next, I will examine the evidence base for indications, benefits, and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically oriented answer with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. VersaJet is a hydrosurgery system that uses a high-pressure saline jet to perform selective debridement of devitalized tissue while simultaneously aspirating debris, combining lavage and sharp debridement in a single handheld device [^1179hDCu] [^114b31mG].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I proceed. The system propels sterile saline at high velocity across the operating window, creating a Venturi effect that both cuts and aspirates tissue; the surgeon can modulate depth and selectivity by adjusting console power settings, handpiece angle, and pressure, which allows precise tangential excision with continuous aspiration of debris [^114b31mG] [^114n2T7p].

> I need to check the device components next. The platform consists of a reusable power console with foot pedal activation, disposable handpieces with different angles and window sizes, and tubing that delivers saline and evacuates debris; this setup enables single-handed, controlled debridement with integrated aspiration, keeping the field cleaner than conventional lavage alone [^114n2T7p] [^114b31mG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications; I should confirm where the evidence is strongest. The most robust clinical use is in burn surgery for tangential excision of partial-thickness burns, with randomized and prospective data showing faster debridement, greater dermal preservation, and improved scar metrics compared with conventional techniques, albeit with some heterogeneity in outcomes and follow-up durations [^1155okm2] [^1153WnLV] [^1166pFV1] [^116FjyvE].

> Let me consider chronic and acute wounds as well. Observational series and prospective cohorts report efficient debridement of traumatic, pressure, venous, and diabetic foot ulcers, often enabling immediate grafting and reducing the number of debridements; however, much of this evidence is nonrandomized and at risk of bias, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing [^1179hDCu] [^112bATgq] [^115SfPZh].

> I should double-check special applications. VersaJet has been used for flap deepithelialization in plastic and reconstructive procedures, yielding time savings and uniform surfaces, and for axillary osmidrosis via hydraulic epilation to ablate apocrine glands, though comparative data on complications and recurrence are mixed and technique-dependent [^114d4KZH] [^112NGw2K] [^1148NHm2].

> Next, I should review limitations and contraindications. The device is less effective on hard, desiccated eschar and cannot debride bone; cost and the need for disposable handpieces are practical considerations, and in some settings conventional sharp debridement remains faster or more appropriate for bulky necrosis, so device selection should be individualized [^113te7pb] [^115mEG9b] [^11483XMZ].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful answer. VersaJet is a hydrosurgical debridement tool that uses a high-pressure saline jet with integrated aspiration to enable precise, selective removal of necrotic or unwanted tissue; it is best supported for burn wound excision, with emerging roles in chronic and acute wound debridement and selected plastic surgery tasks, offering potential advantages in tissue preservation and operative efficiency, but with evidence quality varying and cost and tissue type limitations to consider [^112itsEW] [^1155okm2] [^1153WnLV] [^1166pFV1].

VersaJet is a **hydrosurgical debridement device** that uses a high-pressure saline jet to selectively remove necrotic tissue while preserving viable structures [^114b31mG]. It combines cutting, irrigation, and aspiration in a single handpiece, enabling precise, controlled debridement with less blood loss and faster procedures than conventional methods [^1155okm2] [^116FjyvE]. VersaJet is widely used for burns, chronic wounds, and traumatic injuries, and is particularly valuable in complex anatomical areas such as the face, hands, and feet [^111TchvF] [^1144EFUM]. Evidence shows improved dermal preservation and reduced intraoperative blood loss, though scar outcomes are mixed and cost remains a consideration [^1153WnLV] [^116FjyvE] [^11483XMZ].

---

## Mechanism of action

VersaJet operates on **hydrosurgery principles**, using a high-pressure saline jet to create a Venturi effect that simultaneously cuts, irrigates, and aspirates tissue [^114b31mG]. The saline jet is directed parallel to the tissue surface, allowing selective removal of necrotic or diseased tissue while sparing viable structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and tendons [^112bATgq]. The device offers adjustable power settings, enabling surgeons to control the depth and precision of debridement based on tissue type and wound characteristics [^1144EFUM].

---

## Clinical applications

VersaJet has been extensively used across multiple clinical scenarios, including:

- **Burn wounds**: Particularly effective for partial-thickness burns, allowing precise debridement with minimal damage to viable dermis [^1153WnLV] [^114RH8y7].

- **Chronic wounds**: Useful for diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous ulcers, facilitating wound bed preparation and reducing bacterial burden [^1179hDCu] [^111aRcGW].

- **Traumatic wounds**: Effective in removing contaminated or devitalized tissue from traumatic injuries, including road rash and degloving injuries [^115Kye6e] [^1141yGoX].

- **Surgical procedures**: Employed in plastic and reconstructive surgery for tasks such as flap deepithelialization and axillary osmidrosis treatment [^114d4KZH] [^112NGw2K] [^115NbxxM].

---

## Advantages of VersaJet

VersaJet offers several **clinical advantages** over traditional debridement methods:

- **Precision and selectivity**: Allows targeted removal of necrotic tissue while preserving viable structures, potentially reducing blood loss and improving healing outcomes [^1153WnLV] [^115SfPZh].

- **Efficiency**: Reduces operative time and the number of debridement sessions required, thereby shortening overall treatment duration [^1155okm2] [^1132k5kn].

- **Reduced pain and discomfort**: Minimizes trauma to healthy tissue, potentially reducing postoperative pain and discomfort [^notfound].

- **Versatility**: Suitable for use in complex anatomical areas, including the face, hands, and feet, where traditional surgical tools may be less effective [^114RH8y7] [^1144EFUM].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its advantages, VersaJet has some **limitations and considerations**:

- **Cost**: The device and disposable handpieces are relatively expensive, which may limit accessibility in some healthcare settings [^11483XMZ] [^1132k5kn].

- **Learning curve**: Surgeons require training and experience to effectively use the device and adjust settings based on tissue type and wound characteristics [^notfound].

- **Not suitable for all wound types**: Less effective for hard, desiccated eschar or bone debridement, where traditional surgical methods may be preferred [^113te7pb] [^115mEG9b].

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

Several studies have evaluated the **clinical effectiveness** of VersaJet:

- **Burn wounds**: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved dermal preservation, reduced blood loss, and faster debridement times compared to conventional methods, although scar outcomes have been mixed [^1153WnLV] [^1166pFV1].

- **Chronic wounds**: Observational studies have reported improved wound bed preparation, reduced bacterial load, and enhanced healing outcomes [^111aRcGW] [^112bATgq].

- **Traumatic wounds**: Case series have highlighted the device's effectiveness in removing embedded contaminants and preparing wounds for reconstruction [^115kFns2] [^115Kye6e].

---

## Safety profile

VersaJet has a favorable safety profile, with minimal reported complications. Potential risks include minor bleeding, infection, and inadvertent damage to viable tissue if improperly used. Proper training and adherence to manufacturer guidelines are essential to **minimize these risks** [^111MGtaP] [^1155okm2].

---

VersaJet is a **hydrosurgical debridement device** that offers precise, efficient, and versatile tissue removal across burn, chronic, and traumatic wounds. It provides advantages such as reduced blood loss, shorter operative times, and improved dermal preservation, but cost and the need for training remain considerations.

### Use of the versaJet for pedicle deepithelialization during breast reduction surgery [^114d4KZH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Many modern techniques of breast reduction require that a pedicle of breast tissue be deepithelialized. The process of deepithelialization is both tedious and time consuming. Many techniques have been described to facilitate the process of deepithelialization in breast reduction, but none have replaced the gold standard of using the scalpel. This series details the authors' results using the VersaJet Hydrosurgery System for pedicle deepithelialization in breast reduction surgery.

Methods

In this study, 20 patients underwent inferior pedicle breast reduction using the VersaJet for pedicle deepithelialization between September 2006 and June 2007. The overall time required for pedicle deepithelialization using the VersaJet was compared with the average overall time required for deepithelialization using the scalpel. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded.

Results

An overall time-savings of 10 to 25 min per case was noted using the VersaJet for pedicle deepithelialization rather than the scalpel. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered due to use of the VersaJet for pedicle deepithelialization.

Conclusions

The VersaJet is a safe and effective tool for pedicle deepithelialization in breast reduction surgery. The VersaJet significantly facilitates the process of pedicle deepithelialization and requires less time than use of the scalpel for the procedure.

### Dermal preservation using the versajet hydrosurgery system for debridement of paediatric burns [^111dgbWg]. Burns (2006). Low credibility.

Loss of dermis is one of the principal factors that contributes to poor scar outcome after severe burn. Dermal loss may be due to the primary injury, surgical management or as a result of infection. Strategies for dermal preservation are therefore important to improve scar quality. We report our early experience using the Versajet hydrosurgery system, to preserve dermal tissues, both directly during surgical debridement and indirectly by reducing infection and optimising the use of biological dressings. In deep partial thickness burns softer necrotic dermis can be removed with the Versajet sparing the underlying tougher viable dermis. In superficial burns the Versajet cleans and removes loose epidermal elements providing an optimal wound surface for the application of biological dressings, even a number of days after injury. Versajet is most useful when the tissue to be removed is softer than that to be left behind.

### Immediate debridement of road rash injuries with versajet® hydrosurgery: traumatic tattoo prevention? [^115Kye6e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Traumatic tattoos can result from accidental deposition of foreign particles in the dermis. These pigmented particles become permanently lodged in the dermis after re-epithelialization of the wound and can give rise to irregular black or blue discoloration of the skin. Different methods for tattoo removal exist. The best strategy is to prevent traumatic tattooing by immediate removal of the foreign bodies before the healing process has begun. We present a fine-tuned debridement method to selectively debride the wound and preserve as much viable tissue as possible.

### The efficacy of versajet ™ hydrosurgery system in burn surgery. A systematic review [^112itsEW]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Prompt debridement of burns and early grafting increase survival rates while reducing morbidity and length of hospitalization. Among the debridement methods, hydrosurgery is gaining popularity during the last decade. This review aims to review all available clinical evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hydrosurgical management of burns. This is a systematic review based on a MEDLINE and Scopus databases search of articles in English from 2015 to October 2016. The terms "hydrosurgery", "hydrodebridement", "hydroscalpels", "water jet surgery", and "Versajet" were used in combination and with the terms "acute wound" and "burns". Retrieval of included studies and critical appraisal of data were assessed following the PRISMA structure. There is good but limited evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the method (level of evidence I-II). No significant differences compared to the conventional surgical debridement are yet documented by currently available literature. There is fair and limited evidence (level III) concerning the cost-effectiveness of the method. Although there is increasing evidence on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of hydrosurgery in burns, large-scale prospective randomized control trials with long-term follow-up are necessary to establish the superiority of the method over conventional surgical debridement in terms of selectivity of removed tissues, reduced necessity for dressings and reoperations, healing time, engraftment, and scar quality. All cost-influencing dynamics of this per se expensive modality need to be thoroughly analyzed to resolve its cost-saving potential.

### Versajet hydrosurgery versus classic escharectomy for burn Débridment: a prospective randomized trial [^1155okm2]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2007). Low credibility.

Our purpose was to conduct a prospective randomized trial to compare the Versajet system (Smith & Nephew, London, UK) vs hand-held dermatome escharectomy for burn débridment. All patients admitted over the course of 1 year at our burn center were recruited and randomly assigned to Versajet or hand-held dermatome escharectomy. We evaluated the 1) time for complete débridment and 2) the efficacy of Versajet in reaching the correct dermal plane. Secondary end points were the assessment of postoperative pain (evaluated with the visual analog scale), adverse effects, complete healing times, and contractures rates (after 6 months). A total of 87 patients were analyzed in two homogeneous groups of 42 (Versajet) and 45 (escharectomy) patients. All of them received adequate débridment, but the Versajet procedure was faster (P < .05) and more precise in obtaining the correct plane. One Versajet patient required ligation of a large subcutaneous vessel, which inadvertently was cut during the procedure. Versajet is a feasible, simple, and safe technique that hastens surgical débridment of burns and adds more precision to the procedure.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^1179hDCu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, a new device, the Versajet, involving "Hydrosurgery Technology" which combines lavage and sharp debridement instrumentation has been described for soft tissue debridement.

Methods

The Versajet Hydrosurgery System utilizes a reusable power console with foot pedal activation, disposable handpiece and tubing assembly in conjunction with sterile saline and standard waste receptacle. The purpose of this paper is to report our experiences with this instrument in debridement of a variety of wounds prior to final reconstructive surgery. Technical details and pitfalls are discussed to facilitate clinical use.

Results

Efficient, safe and fast debridement was achieved in all patients using the hydrosurgery system. The actual time the hydrosurgery system was used for debridement averaged as 15.5 minutes. In ten patients, an adequately debrided wound bed was achieved with a single operative procedure, in four patients; two stages were required prior to reconstructive surgery. In one patient with recurrent sacral-iscial pressure sore, two debridements were carried out followed by long term vacuum assisted closure. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients, but in three with a minor breakdown of the skin graft, which eventually healed with no surgical intervention.

Conclusion

As a result of our clinical experience, the Versajet enables surgeon to precisely target damaged and necrotic tissue and spare viable tissue. This modality may be a useful alternative tool for soft tissue debridement in certain cases. However, further studies are required to investigate its cost-effectiveness in wound management.

### Debridement of burn wounds with a water jet surgical tool [^114RH8y7]. Burns (2006). Low credibility.

A new instrument, the Versajet system, based on fluid jet technology has recently been advocated as an alternative to standard surgical excisional technique for burn wounds. In this paper we describe our experience with this tool, the technique employed as well as its clinical feasability for debriding partial thickness burn wounds. Seventeen patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy of debridement of their burn wounds using the Versajet system. Burn wound areas of between 0.5 and 5% total body surface (TBSA) involving the face, arm, hand, leg and foot underwent debridement using the Versajet system. The Versajet system was able to sufficiently debride superficial partial thickness and mid-dermal partial thickness wounds for subsequent placement of Biobrane. Deeper partial thickness wounds could be excised for successful autografting. The Versajet system demonstrated some particular advantage in the surgical treatment of superficial to mid-partial thickness burns in areas like the face, hand and foot which can often be difficult to reach and contour with conventional modalities.

### VersaJet hydrosurgery system: an effective device for flap deepithelialization [^112NGw2K]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Many instruments and techniques to reduce time and effort for deepithelialization have been described, but they are time-consuming and labor-intensive. The VersaJet Hydrosurgery System (Smith Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom) has gained widespread acceptance and use for fast, selective, and easy soft tissue debridement. The authors described the use of the VersaJet Hydrosurgery System for flap deepithelialization. Operative techniques, overall time, and histology are reviewed. Six gluteus maximus myocutaneous V-Y advancement flaps were used in 3 patients who underwent flap insetting with partial deepithelialization by VersaJet. The mean time savings was 12 minutes (range, 10–15 min). The flap deepithelialized by VersaJet shows significantly even and regular surface in gross view. In the histologic study, the thickness of preserved papillary dermis was thicker using the Versajet because it contains much skin appendages when compared with conventional scalpel debridement. No patients developed infection, epidermal cyst, or hematoma. The VersaJet provides safe, effective, and tissue-preserving deepithelialization compared with using scalpel.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^1113CqmQ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In 2013, Kim et al. first used Versajet for treatment of axillary osmidrosis. They performed two long incisions, such as surgical epilation, to flip the flap and perform epilation with Versajet in the same way as surgical epilation. This treatment method considerably improved malodor in 97% of the patients, which was a distinct improvement over previously used surgical epilation methods, and the rate of complications was reported to be only 6.4%.

We made small incisions similar to that made for liposuction to preserve the dermal circulation and performed hydraulic epilation with Versajet.

Versajet has two apertures and is an angled hand piece shaped like a hockey stick. A high-pressure water jet is created in the aperture at its tip, which scrapes out the target tissue. The vacuum generated by the venturi effect of other aperture removes aspirates and debris to clear the operative field, thereby reducing tissue damage while efficiently removing only the desired tissue.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^116jDbRM]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation is an ideal surgical procedure for the treatment of axillary osmidrosis and combines the benefits of surgical epilation and liposuction. This procedure is, therefore, associated with a low recurrence rate, low incidence of complications, and minimal scarring.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^112rH3E6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is an essential part of wound care prior to any reconstructive options. Sharp techniques utilized for this purpose have been the mainstay and are commonly used in combination with pulsed lavage and/or irrigation.

Recently, a new device, the Versajet™ Hydrosurgery system, has been described for debridement. The Versajet™ hydrosurgery system utilizes high fluid technology for wound debridement. To date, few papers evaluating its role have been published in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to report our experiences with this instrument in debridement of a variety of wounds prior to final reconstructive surgery. Technical details and pitfalls are discussed to facilitate clinical use.

### VERSAJET hydrosurgery technique for the preparation of full thickness skin grafts and the creation of retrograde split thickness skin grafts [^116G2cYq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Full- and split-thickness skin grafts continue to serve a vital role in lower extremity wound coverage, and meticulous preparation of the recipient site is vital to incorporation of the transplanted skin. A technique for the rapid, controlled preparation of full-thickness skin grafts and creation of thick-split thickness skin grafts from full-thickness donor tissue, using a high-pressure stream of saline solution, is described.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^111aRcGW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Use of Versajet™ seemed to decrease the number of the debridements required in preparation of the wounds in our cases. This was evidenced by the decreased postoperative wound infection and better reconstructive outcome with higher skin graft take rate. In decubitus ulcers, venous ulcers, chronic ulceration from traumatic or postsurgical wounds, Granick et al. demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of debridements required to adequately prepare the wound bed for closure in Versajet™ group compared to conventional techniques. This seemed to be associated with more efficient debridement leading to decreased bacterial count. Mosti et al. compared the Versajet™ and traditional moist dressing in leg ulcers and found that bacterial burden decreased from 10⁶ to 10³ in approximately 42% of the patients in the Versajet™ group. However, a randomized controlled study seems necessary to demonstrate the effects of the Versajet™ system on quantitative bacterial load as compared to conventional techniques.

Patients and methods

Hydrosurgery system

The Versajet™ hydrosurgery system was provided by Smith & Nephew, Inc. Colorado. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this new surgical instrument that utilizes a high powered parallel waterjet for wound debridement. The system consists of a reusable power console with foot pedal activation, disposable hand piece (15°/14 mm, 45°/14 mm, 45°/8 mm) and tubing assembly in conjunction with sterile saline and standard waste receptacle for maximized effectiveness (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4).

The receptacle in which the debri and aspiration fluid are collected.

The hydrosurgery system projects a high-velocity waterjet across the operating window into an evacuation collector thereby creating a localized vacuum. The suction permits the surgeon to hold and cut targeted tissue while aspirating debris from the site. The cutting and aspiration effects can be controlled by adjusting console power settings (10: highest, 1: lowest), handpiece orientation, and handpiece pressure

The hydrosurgery system was used for debridement of fifteen wounds in fifteen patients: 2 venous ulcers (distal leg extending to the foot dorsum, and the middle third of the leg), 1 sacral-iscial pressure sore, 1 burn wound to hand, 1 traumatic scalp wound, 2 traumatic thigh and/or popliteal fossa wounds, 2 traumatic leg wounds, 1 thigh wound following necrotizing fasciitis (Shooter's abscess), 1 leg wound following necrotizing fasciitis (Diabetic), 1 traumatic elbow wound, 1 traumatic foot wound, 1 traumatic arm wound, and 1 above knee amputation stump wound (Table 1). For all cases, a standard handpiece with a 45 degree angled tip and a 14 mm working window was employed. Four cases that underwent debridement with the hydrosurgery system are presented in the following section.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^114j1Kso]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Osmidrosis is a malodorous disease caused by the breakdown of sweat secreted from the apocrine glands by surface bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation for the treatment of axillary osmidrosis.

Methods

Thirty-two patients with axillary osmidrosis (64 axillae) underwent Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation between January 2016 and January 2017. Subjective assessments were evaluated by a patient survey at least 3 months after the procedure.

Results

There were no complications other than one mild pigmentation in the axilla at 3 months after the procedure. Thirty-two patients evaluated malodor elimination as good. No patients evaluated it as fair or poor. There were no recurrences.

Conclusion

Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation is an ideal surgical procedure for the treatment of axillary osmidrosis that decreases complications and recurrence.

### Prospective, randomised controlled trial comparing versajet ™ hydrosurgery and conventional debridement of partial thickness paediatric burns [^1153WnLV]. Burns (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Conventional surgical debridement of burn wounds consists of tangential excision of eschar using a knife or dermabrasion until viable dermis or punctate bleeding occurs. The Versajet™ (Smith and Nephew, St. Petersburg, FL, USA) hydrosurgery system has also been advocated for burn wound debridement, with the suggestion that enhanced preservation of dermal tissue might reduce subsequent scarring.

Methods

A prospective randomised controlled trial was undertaken comparing Versajet™ to conventional debridement. After excluding those with facial burns, 61 children ≤ 16 years of age undergoing debridement and skin grafting for partial thickness burns were recruited. Adequacy of debridement was assessed by 2mm punch biopsies taken pre- and post-debridement. Surgical time, percentage graft take at day 10, time to healing, post-operative infection and scarring at 3 and 6 months were assessed.

Results

Thirty-one children underwent conventional debridement and 30 debridement using Versajet™. There was a significant difference in the amount of viable dermal preservation between the two groups (p = 0.02), with more viable tissue lost in the conventional group (median 325 μm) versus the Versajet™ group (median 35 μm). There was no significant difference between graft take at day 10 (p = 0.9), post-operative wound infection (p = 0.5), duration of surgery (p = 0.6) or time to healing after grafting (p = 0.6). Despite better dermal preservation in the Versajet™ group, there was no significant difference between scarring at 3 or 6 months (p = 1.0, 0.1).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that Versajet™ hydrosurgery appears a more precise method of burn wound debridement. Although dermal preservation may be a factor in reducing subsequent hypertrophic scarring, there were no significant differences found between scarring at 3 or 6 months after-injury.

### Resurfacing of total penile full-thickness burn managed with the versajet hydrosurgery system [^1149wVEL]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of penile skin loss resulting from various causes is a challenge for clinician. Especially in a potent man, functional and cosmetic outcomes are demanded. Conservative treatment with topical agents is not enough for the full-thickness burn although hypertrophic scar and secondary contracture usually occurs. Resurfacing of total penile full-thickness burn after wound management with the Versajet hydrosurgery system (a water-jet powered debrider) is described for the first use in our hospital.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^1132k5kn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The system enables rapid and controlled debridement, likely resulting in shorter procedure times. In our experience it reduced total operating room time for debridement with the estimated time of debridement on average approximately 1.5 times higher if Versajet™ debridement was not used. Although the scope of this paper is not to study cost-effectiveness of the system, but to describe our experiences with the Versajet™, there is some evidence indicating significant cost savings and reduction of the number of required debridement procedures with hydrosurgery system compared to conventional techniques. Despite the high cost of the disposable handpiece (355 $), it has been indicated that the hydrosurgical approach shortens hospitalization and healing time, thus allowing a total savings in wound management. However, none of these studies 1,4 have included a well-designed control group to demonstrate conclusively that the instrument is cost effective. Further studies in this field that include a true control group in their study design are required.

Nevertheless, based on our experience, we believe that the hydrosurgery system worked more efficiently in the presented case series for wound preparation and debridement with a satisfactory outcome compared to conventional sharp techniques utilized in similar control wounds.

We have been using this hydrosurgery system for wound debridement for approximately one year and based on my sixteen-year experience in debridement of a variety of similar wounds with conventional sharp techniques and subsequent reconstruction, a comparison between conventional sharp debridement and hydrosurgery system is provided in the following paragraphs, in addition to pertinent comparison data from few available published reports.

Chronic venous ulcers and diabetic wounds of the lower extremity were debrided more efficiently with the hydrosurgery system compared to the sharp knife. Versajet™ gradually removed the necrotic and/or fibrinous tissue and enabled us more precisely to preserve the viable tissue for a possible skin grafting. In such cases, the outcome was significantly better in Versajet™ group.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^1178zx9H]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The hydraulic jet pressure can be adjusted to 10 levels based on the tissue to be removed. Smooth granulation tissue requires the lowest setting, while tougher tissues need higher settings. At the time of the osmidrosis operation, we set the power grade of Versajet to about 2–3, held the hand piece upside down, tenting the undermined flap, and removed the subdermal fat and apocrine glands in a crisscross manner.

A quantitative analysis of apocrine glands was performed through tissue biopsies and analysis at each stage of the procedure. After liposuction, the average number of apocrine glands decreased from 66.4 to 9.3, which was an 86% reduction compared to the preoperative level. Hydraulic epilation with Versajet reduced the mean number of apocrine glands to 2.4, which was a 96.4% reduction from the preoperative level. With liposuction alone, the apocrine gland residual rate was relatively higher at 14%, which may contribute to the high recurrence rate. Liposuction when supplemented with Versajet application showed an apocrine gland residual rate of 3.5%, with no recurrence and no wound complications. The decrease in apocrine gland number at each step was statistically significant (p value was 0.006) (Fig. 6). Thus, hydraulic epilation using Versajet was found to be an ideal method to remove apocrine glands present under the dermis with minimum dermal injury. This can be a theoretical basis for minimizing recurrence and complications.

Fig. 6

Two of the 32 patients relapsed after liposuction alone at a previous hospital. The remaining apocrine glands were visually confirmed by a small incision and removed directly by Versajet. No recurrence and complications reported. We believe that the use of Versajet can be useful not only in primary cases but also in recurrent cases.

Postoperative hematoma increases the incidence of skin necrosis, infection, pigmentation, and wound dehiscence and delays wound healing leading to scar formation. With Versajet, bleeding points can be directly observed over the entire surgical field through the 1-cm incision, and electrocautery can be performed. This ensures a lower likelihood of hematoma formation when compared with liposuction.

### Application of hydrosurgery for burn wound debridement: an 8-year cohort analysis [^111TchvF]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During the last decade, the Versajet™ hydrosurgery system has become popular as a tool for tangential excision in burn surgery. Although hydrosurgery is thought to be a more precise and controlled manner for burn debridement prior to skin grafting, burn specialists decide individually whether hydrosurgery should be applied in a specific patient or not. The aim of this study was to gain insight in which patients hydrosurgery is used in specialized burn care in the Netherlands.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted in all patients admitted to a Dutch burn centre between 2009 and 2016. All patients with burns that underwent surgical debridement were included. Data were collected using the national Dutch Burn Repository R3.

Results

Data of 2113 eligible patients were assessed. These patients were treated with hydrosurgical debridement (23.9%), conventional debridement (47.7%) or a combination of these techniques (28.3%). Independent predictors for the use of hydrosurgery were a younger age, scalds, a larger percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, head and neck burns and arm burns. Differences in surgical management and clinical outcome were found between the three groups.

Conclusion

The use of hydrosurgery for burn wound debridement prior to skin grafting is substantial. Independent predictors for the use of hydrosurgery were mainly burn related and consisted of a younger age, scalds, a larger TBSA burned, and burns on irregularly contoured body areas. Randomized studies addressing scar quality are needed to open new perspectives on the potential benefits of hydrosurgical burn wound debridement.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^1154VFWz]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osmidrosis is a malodorous disease caused by the breakdown of sweat secreted from the apocrine glands by surface bacteria.

There are currently no recognized diagnostic criteria for osmidrosis (bromhidrosis).

We have considered surgery when there is a subjective symptom of odor, and there is a sense of discomfort in social activities.

The various treatment methods include non-surgical ones, such as the use of topical antiperspirants or injection of botulinum toxin, and surgical ones such as surgical epilation and liposuction. The surgical methods are more effective and have long-lasting results.

The aim of our surgery is to remove almost every apocrine gland and reduce recurrence rates, while also ensuring minimal postsurgical complications.

If the dermis is excessively damaged to reduce the recurrence of osmidrosis, complications such as skin necrosis and hematoma may occur. Thus, we used a Versajet (Versajet hydrosurgery system, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) to minimize dermis injury and remove almost all apocrine glands below the dermis. 'Hydraulic epilation' means epilation with a high-pressure water jet.

The surgical results were evaluated by clinical outcomes, histopathologic findings, subjective evaluation of degree of improvement, and evaluation of surgical satisfaction.

The aim of this study is to review the literature on various surgical methods for the treatment of osmidrosis and to compare the incidence of complications and recurrence rate with the results of this study to show the effectiveness of Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation.

### Novel therapeutic use of versajet for intestinal mucormycosis [^116HQFvU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We describe the case of a 17-year-old boy who developed intestinal mucormycosis from Rhizophus oryzae (order Mucorales) following chemotherapy for the management of acute myeloid leukaemia. He underwent a hemicolectomy and further surgery utilising the pressure washing of Versajet to debride colonised fungal collections from the psoas muscle limiting the amount of surgical debridement needed.

### Comparison of effectiveness and associated complications between conventional subdermal excision and hydrosurgery (versajet) for osmidrosis [^1148NHm2]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shown hydrosurgery (Versajet TM II) is a simple and effective tool with reduced complications in surgical treatment of osmidrosis. Since then, hydrosurgery has been widely used for osmidrosis. However, we have experienced that some complications often occur in patients treated with hydrosurgery.

Objective

We hypothesized that using a hydrosurgery could lead to excessive resection of the tightly attached apocrine glands and thus more complications. We aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and associated complications of the hydrosurgery method for osmidrosis were compared with those of conventional methods with two parallel incisions.

Methods & Materials

We retrospectively analyzed 31 and 16 patients who underwent conventional and hydrosurgery methods, respectively, for osmidrosis from 2010 to 2020. Two parallel long incisions were identical in both groups. Early complications (hematoma, seroma, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, revision, scar contracture), late complications (scar, pigmentation, comedones/milia, and sebaceous cysts), and effectiveness (subjective satisfaction, malodor elimination, reduced hair growth, and sweating elimination) were evaluated.

Results

Skin necrosis was significantly more frequent in the hydrosurgery group than in the conventional group (p = 0.036). No other significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of other complications and effectiveness. As a result of comparing effectiveness, subjective satisfaction (p = 0.306), malodor elimination (p = 1.000), reduced hair growth (p = 1.000), and sweating elimination (p = 0.742) did not show any significant difference between the two groups.

Conclusion

Osmidrosis treatment with the use of VERSAJET™ Hydrosurgery System yielded similar and satisfactory results as the conventional subdermal excision method. The incidence of skin necrosis was higher in the hydrosurgery group than in the conventional group with two parallel incisions.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^1144EFUM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The highly selective form of tangential excision enables surgeon to precisely target damaged and necrotic tissue and spare viable tissue. Furthermore, the hydrosurgery system offers multiple power settings for controlled excision around delicate tissues.

The Versajet™ hydrosurgery system enables the surgeon to accurately control the cutting, debriding and aspiration effects by adjusting the console power settings from 1 to 10 as well as by angulating the hand piece. Increasing the power setting decreases the duration of debridement, whereas decreasing the power setting increases the duration of debridement. Alternating pressure of the handpiece can further modulate its use and effect on the wound surface. It would be safer if one starts with a lower setting and makes appropriate adjustments based on the individual wound being excised.

Preservation of nerves, vessels, and tendons is of utmost importance when performing debridement in the hand (as in patient 2), and surgical precision and control of excisional depth are particularly important. The power setting of 2 or 3 allowed an efficient and safe debridement in this case. Sharp techniques do not work well in small areas and in areas with a three-dimensional structure and the Versajet™ demonstrated particular advantage in the debridement of superficial to mid-thickness burns in areas like the face, hand, and foot which can be difficult to reach and contour with conventional techniques.

Another significant advantage of this device demonstrated was its ability to efficiently debride irregular and complex contour wounds such as deep pressure sores, traumatic wounds which can often be difficult to effect with cold knife (Patient 6, Fig. 17, 18). However, because in its current form, the device does not effectively debride desiccated eschar in pressure sores covered with dry eschar, the preferred approach is to sharply remove the eschar and then use the Versajet™ to debride the underlying necrotic tissue.

### Management of 2nd-degree facial burns using the versajet® hydrosurgery system and xenograft: a prospective evaluation of 20 cases [^1132NeB1]. Burns (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is no single therapeutic scheme for the management of intermediary 2nd-degree facial burns, which can cause problems because of their uncertain course. It is preferable to obtain optimal healing of the face in order to avoid functional or cosmetic sequelae. Some practitioners recommend early excision (first week) of these burns, whereas others prefer to wait and perform surgery later (after 2 weeks). The practice in our burns unit is early surgery (from the first week) associated with hydrosurgical excision and application of a biosynthetic dressing (xenograft). A prospective follow-up of 20 cases was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of our protocol.

Patients and Methods

The prospective evaluation was performed with follow-up at 2 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. The patients included had intermediary 2nd-degree burns on at least 15% of the face and no life-threatening prognosis. The mean age in our series was 40.5 years (16–72), the mean percentage of burn surface area was 27.75% and the mean percentage of facial burn was 60.75%. Early excision was performed (day 5–10) using the Versajet(®) system, which allows tangential water-dissection. Porcine xenograft (E-Z Derm(®)) was applied immediately afterwards. Patients whose healing process was not complete at 2 weeks were then scheduled to receive a thin autograft. Patients were followed up 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge.

Results

Excision was performed at a mean 7.6 days, and mean initial healing time was 13.4 days. In three cases, a full-thickness skin graft was used, whereas healing occurred in the other patients without further grafts. Two patients had functional sequelae (ectropion) corrected later by repair surgery. The course of healing for the other patients proceeded normally.

Discussion

There is no consensus about the management of intermediate depth 2nd-degree facial burns. We chose to perform early surgery using the Versajet(®) system, which allows fine, precise excision, leaving nearly all of the healthy tissue in place. The Versajet(®) is particularly adapted to facial contours and is clearly more efficacious than the customary dermatomes. The use of a xenograft may augment facial healing while reducing the number of dressings and lessening patient discomfort. Our protocol provides the advantages of early management (limitation of functional sequelae, reduced hospitalization time), while avoiding too extensive or deep an excision through use of the Versajet(®).

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1177MDdr]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcer — debridement and wound bed preparation emphasize that debridement of necrotic tissue is an integral component in the treatment of chronic wounds since they will not heal in the presence of unviable tissue, debris, or critical colonization; debridement serves various functions including removal of necrotic tissue and callus, reduction of pressure, wound bed and tracking/tunneling evaluation, and reduction of bacterial burden, and it facilitates drainage and stimulates healing; debridement may be contraindicated in arterial ulcers, and except in avascular cases, adequate debridement must always precede topical agents, dressings, or closure procedures; among debridement methods, only surgical debridement has been proven to be efficacious in clinical trials and is the cornerstone of management, with thorough sharp debridement using a scalpel, tissue nippers, curettes, and curved scissors; excision should extend until healthy, bleeding soft tissue and bone are encountered and any surrounding callus must also be removed, with the main purpose to turn a chronic ulcer into an acute, healing wound; a deep abscess requires hospital admission and immediate incision and drainage, and joint resection or partial amputation is necessary if osteomyelitis, joint infection, or gangrene are present; regular removal of necrotic tissue can expedite healing and increase the probability of full secondary closure, whereas less frequent surgical debridement can reduce healing and increase infection risk; surgical debridement is repeated as often as needed if new necrotic tissue forms, and frequent "maintenance debridement" is commonly required; some clinicians distinguish surgical debridement as operating-room care versus clinic-based sharp debridement; hydrosurgery (Versajet®, Smith & Nephew, Inc, London, UK) is noted as a novel system indicated for surgical debridement of damaged and necrotic tissue in traumatic, ulcerated, and chronic wounds, surgical incisions, and burns.

### Acute contaminated open forearm fractures treated with versaJet hydrosurgical Débridement [^115kFns2]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2010). Low credibility.

The ideal method of irrigation and débridement for severe extremity wounds has yet to be determined. This report demonstrates the use of hydrosurgical débridement in the treatment of highly contaminated acute forearm fractures in a 22-year-old man ejected during a motor vehicle crash in a farm area. The result was rapid, selective, and effective débridement of deeply embedded material, which allowed for expeditious reconstruction with internal fixation, tendon transfers, and groin flap coverage while avoiding infection and injury to vital structures. The technique is described in detail and the current literature is reviewed.

### Treatment of axillary osmidrosis with the use of versajet [^115NbxxM]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Axillary osmidrosis is a distressing problem. Since the secretion from apocrine glands is believed to be responsible for malodour, many treatment modalities have been developed to remove the glands. Local surgery with the excision of the apocrine glands has been proved to be most effective. We introduce the treatment of axillary osmidrosis, using Versajet (Versajet hydrosurgery system, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA). From October 2010 to February 2012, 31 patients (21 females and 10 males) whose age ranged from 12 to 63 years were treated. All patients were followed up for 13.1 months on average. Thirty patients were very satisfied and recommended this procedure and one patient was satisfied with the result. We experienced one haematoma and one wound dehiscence. Excision of glands, using Versajet, makes the operation a simple and efficient procedure. Moreover, precise and even debridement reduces complications by preserving the skin flap and subdermal plexus.

### Intermediate-level disinfection with accelerated hydrogen peroxide prevents accumulation of bacteria in versajet ™ tubing during repeated daily debridement using simulated-use testing with an inoculated pork hock [^113kWi9B]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assesses the feasibility of using the Versajet™ system (VJS) on an inoculated pork hock (PH) skin surface sequentially for 8 days with daily cleaning and intermediate-level disinfection (ILD).

Methods

Daily, PHs were inoculated with bacteria suspended in artificial test soil (ATS). An ILD protocol with accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP, OxivirTB(®)) was employed to clean and disinfect the VJS between debridements.

Results

PH skin contains 6.1–6.8×10⁶cfu/cm² bacteria. Bacterial counts in the handpiece and discharge hoses immediately after debridement of the PHs, and before cleaning, increased throughout the study period (5.19–6.43log₁₀cfu/mL). Cleaning with the ILD protocol was reduced bacterial counts on the VJS by 6-log. Protein, a surrogate marker of organic contamination, was also reduced post-cleaning and ILD. Compared to a maximum post-debridement level of protein (57.9 μg/mL) obtained before ILD, VJS protein levels dropped to 9.8 (handpiece) and 13.8 μg/mL (discharge hose).

Conclusions

Disinfection of the handpiece and discharge hose after debridement with AHP resulted in a 6-log reduction in bacterial count and 4.2 fold reduction in protein. An ILD protocol with an AHP may be a feasible method for serial skin surface debridements with the VJS for up to eight days.

### The estimation of tissue loss during tangential hydrosurgical debridement [^115SfPZh]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The preservation of healthy tissue during surgical debridement is desirable as this may improve clinical outcomes. This study has estimated for the first time the amount of tissue lost during debridement using the VERSAJET system of tangential hydrosurgery. A multicenter, prospective case series was carried out on 47 patients with mixed wound types: 21 (45%) burns, 13 (28%) chronic wounds, and 13 (28%) acute wounds. Overall, 44 (94%) of 47 patients achieved appropriate debridement after a single debridement procedure as verified by an independent photographic assessment. The percentage of necrotic tissue reduced from a median of 50% to 0% (P < 0.001). Median wound area and depth increased by only 0.3 cm (6.8%) and 0.5 mm (25%), respectively. Notably, 43 (91%) of 47 wounds did not progress into a deeper compartment, indicating a high degree of tissue preservation.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^112Dvwf6]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

Patients

From January 2016 to January 2017, 32 axillary osmidrosis patients underwent Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions.

All patients who had subjective symptoms of odor and discomfort in social life due to odor were included in the study, and those who refused the use of Versajet or did not agree with this study were excluded from the study.

The mean age of the patients was 30.4 ± 19.7 years, ranging from 11 to 71 years. The male-to-female ratio of patients who underwent the procedure was 1:5.4. The mean follow-up period was 8.16 ± 3.2 months with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up to check for recurrence.

The author used Versajet (Versajet ® hydrosurgery system, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) to remove the apocrine glands below the dermis with minimal injury. Postsurgical evaluation included histopathological evaluation, degree of improvement in symptoms and patient satisfaction.

Surgical Procedure

Both axillae were shaved before surgery, and the subdermal undermining area was marked at a width of about 1 cm larger than the hair-bearing area of the axilla (Fig. 1). After local anesthesia using 1:100,000 lidocaine and epinephrine solution into the incision site, about 80–100 cc tumescent solution (Hartmann solution 500 cc + normal saline 25 cc + 2% lidocaine 25 cc + 8.4% bicarbonate 5 cc + epinephrine 1 cc) was injected into the subcutaneous tissues. Two 1-cm-long incisions were made along the anterior and lateral margin of the marked area, parallel to the axillary crease (Fig. 1).

Results

The male-to-female ratio of patients who underwent the procedure was 5:27.

There were no complications other than mild pigmentation in the axilla.

Average apocrine gland counts under ×40 magnification were 66.4 preoperatively, 9.3 after liposuction, and 2.4 after Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation (Table 4).

Table 4

Three months after the procedure, all 32 patients responded with a 'good' result that they were not aware of the malodor. Thirty of the 32 patients responded with a significant reduction in sweating after surgery, and 2 patients responded with a slight decrease. Two patients reported significant reduction in axillary hair growth, 28 patients reported a moderate reduction, and 2 others had a slight reduction.

All patients were satisfied with the results of the procedure. Twenty-nine patients responded that they were highly satisfied and would recommend this surgical procedure to others. Three patients, although satisfied with the procedure, did not wish to recommend it to others.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^115mEG9b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Deep pressure sores, traumatic complex deep perineal wounds, traumatic deep extremity wounds with irregular surfaces were often hard to debride with sharp techniques, and we found the handpiece of the Versajet™ very efficient for debridement of the deep necrotic tissues. Similarly, in traumatic degloving type injuries where avulsion skin flaps developed, it was often very difficult to debride necrotic tissues under those flaps using conventional technique. By means of the handpiece, Versajet™ provided faster and more effective debridement that also allowed the flaps to easily attach to the recipient wound bed. Furthermore, sharp knife sometimes caused unexpectedly deep debridements jeopardizing the viability of the avulsed flaps. A clinical comparison revealed a better postoperative outcome in cases where hydrosurgery system was used.

In our experience, in deep second degree as well as third degree burn injuries involving large flat surfaces, tangential excision using sharp knife has always been a superior option. In addition, using the Versajet™ in such cases increased the time required for debridement, in addition to its cost. However, in small three dimensional areas requiring debridement Versajet™ proved to be a better alternative.

There was no difference between Versajet™ and conventional techniques in terms of operating time required for debridement, number of the debridements and outcome when treating superficial second degree burn wounds and superficial traumatic or postsurgical wounds, regardless of wound size. However, Versajet™ proved to be costly when used in such cases.

Versajet™ was not an option for removing eschar. Furthermore Versajet™ was not effectively applicable in wounds where the bulk and amount of necrotic tissue load was very high. In such cases, conventional sharp techniques provided faster and efficient debridement and better outcome. Nevertheless one can remove the bulky necrotic tissue with sharp techniques and use Versajet™ for a precise debridement in such cases. However cost of the treatment would be an issue in such cases.

### Versajet-assisted hydraulic epilation through small incisions for axillary osmidrosis [^114uFNN9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The axillary skin flap was undermined using scissors. And then, liposuction was used to remove fat that was unevenly attached to the dermis (Fig. 2 a, b). After ensuring the uniform removal of fat, we turned the Versajet hand piece upside down, tenting the flap, set it to power grade 3, and shaved the deep dermis in a crisscross manner (Fig. 3). We set the end point of hydraulic epilation to be when all the apocrine glands and fat below the dermis, especially around the hair follicles, were removed and a uniform dermis was observed (Fig. 2 c).

Electrocautery was used for hemostasis of axillar perforators and veins. Irrigation was performed through the incision site to remove residual gland debris and hematomas. Quilting suture was performed on the skin flap using 4–0 vicryl. And then a 3-mm-width Penrose drain was inserted into both axillae (Fig. 4). The wound was closed with 5–0 nylon and dressed with bolster and elastic bandage.

Postoperative Management

All patients were monitored at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 14 days after the procedure. The Penrose drain was removed 1 day after the procedure. The quilting suture and compression dressing were removed 5 days after the procedure. Patients were instructed to limit the movements of their armpits and avoid rubbing and vigorous exercise. The suture at the incision site was removed approximately 10 days after the procedure.

### Hydrosurgical and conventional debridement of burns: randomized clinical trial [^1166pFV1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedures and interventions

Every participant acted as their own control. Two similar wound areas (assigned A or B) of at least 25 cm² were selected in each patient by the surgeon. If possible, the study areas were adjacent. Otherwise, a similar burn wound at the contralateral body part or the nearest comparable burn wound was chosen. Photographs were taken to facilitate identification of both areas during follow-up. After assignment by the surgeon and before surgery started, the study areas were randomly allocated, using a web-based automated randomization system, to either hydrosurgical or conventional debridement with a Weck knife in the operating room by a member of the research team. During the operation, the study areas were debrided with the VERSAJET™ Hydrosurgery System (Smith + Nephew, London UK) or conventional surgery using a hand-held knife. Both study areas were debrided during the same procedure and covered with the same size of meshed split-skin graft or Meek wall grafts and identical non-adhesive wound dressings. Graft harvesting, meshing, and fixation were done following local treatment protocols. This design allowed comparison of hydrosurgical versus conventional debridement within the same participant while controlling for variations in healing and scarring that could occur between patient groups. Dressings were left in situ for 5–7 days. Both study areas were followed until complete wound closure (at least 95 per cent re-epithelialization) was achieved, assessed by a member of the research team and documented with photographs and notes from a clinician in the patient's file as instructed by the standard operating procedure. Standard of care involved visits to the outpatient clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Clinicians/researchers who assessed scar quality during follow-up and patients were blinded to the modality used to debride the study areas.

Baseline characteristics

Investigators not involved in the clinical care of participants were responsible for trial recruitment, allocation, and data collection. They recorded the following baseline characteristics for all included patients: age, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type, comorbidities, percentage TBSA burned, wound aetiology, burn depth, and time to surgery. During surgery, Weck knife, Versajet settings, and skin graft expansion were recorded.

### Immediate skin grafting of sub-acute and chronic wounds debrided by hydrosurgery [^112bATgq]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A wound bed may be prepared by various non-surgical debridements using autolytic, biological or enzymatic techniques. These are all effective in selective wounds but tend to be time consuming. Surgical debridement is not selective since healthy collateral tissue is also removed. Physical debridement uses whirlpool therapy to slough off necrotic tissues - the saline which comes out of the hand piece if vapourized over the wound - and therefore disseminates contaminated droplets. Hydrosurgery combines physical and surgical debridement but does not have their drawbacks. Water dissection works by using a high-pressure jet of sterile saline that travels parallel to the wound and creates a Venturi effect, thus enabling the selective removal of necrotic tissues without dissemination of contaminants. In this study, the authors report on 167 sub-acute and chronic wounds from 155 patients treated under general anaesthesia by hydrosurgery (Versajet). Of these, 95% of the debrided wounds were immediately covered with an autologous meshed graft. Compared to other debridement techniques, hydrosurgery has two main advantages: namely its tissue selectivity and its high percentage of successful engraftment after immediate skin grafting.

### Device related tangential excision in burns [^1164Ztf7]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Tangential excision in burns serves to preserve uninjured tissue in order to maximise cosmesis and function. Excision of all necrotic tissue remains absolutely necessary prior to reconstruction, and the choice of debridement method will depend on the injury, the condition of the patient and the experience of the surgeon. A problem with tangential excision has been that the amount of tissue excised is often greater than the amount of necrotic tissue. Techniques of tangential excision are described. Those using a guard, such as the Goulian or Watson knife, allow the depth of the gap between the blade and the guard to be varied. However, there remains the issue of precision, and a variance between the shape of the blade and of certain parts of the body. "Shelving" can occur as variances in the depth of excision slopes conflict with the uniform thickness of split thickness grafts or Integra, and may lead to an excess of tissue at the periphery of a wound, or "stuck on" appearance. Dermatome debridement may result in less loss of tissue, but this technique can difficult to perform due to the amount of blood loss. The Versajet (Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) hydrosurgery system enables a more precise removal of unhealthy tissue, as it allows the narrowest excision margin currently available. As with many new techniques, the debridement may take longer at first, but the improved results will justify the extra time. In addition to greater precision in tangential excision, a better and smoother surface for future grafting may be created.

Patient 1

This was a 44-year-old male patient who presented to the Plastic Surgery outpatient clinic with a chronic non-healing wound on the left leg (10 × 15 cm) due to venous stasis. The wound had been present for three months and exhibited positive methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cultures on two occasions. The MRSA was treated with parenteral as well as oral antibiotics. Past medical history was significant for moderate rheumatoid arthritis for which the patient was taking 5 mg prednisone daily. The patient's wound was initially treated using wet to dry dressings for five days. Next, a single debridement with the Versajet™ hydrosurgery system (Power setting: 5) was performed followed by immediate split-thickness skin grafting. Early postoperative course was uneventful with full graft take (Fig. 5, 6, 7).

This was a 42-year-old female patient who had a third degree burn injury to the left hand following a motor cycle accident. The injury affected the volar and proximal aspect of index, middle, ringer, little finger and distal palmar regions. An initial escharectomy was followed by two debridements using the hydrosurgery system (Power setting: 2–3). Subsequently, a thick partial thickness skin grafting was performed with full take (Fig. 8, 9, 10). Physical therapy was started within ten days after skin grafting with no disability or contracture formation at 3 month-follow-up.

### Safety and efficacy of waterjet debridement vs. conventional debridement in the treatment of extremely severe burns: a retrospective analysis [^114xRjV5]. Burns (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with extremely severe burns often require rapid wound closure with a tangential excision or escharectomy combined with a skin graft to reduce life-threatening complications such as infection. Traditional tangential excision surgery using the Watson or Humby knife does not allow accurate excision of necrotic tissue and often removes too much active tissue, which is detrimental to the rapid healing of the wound. Importantly, the Versajet hydrosurgical system, with its smaller handle, allows for more precise excision of necrotic burn tissue and preserves more active dermal tissue, positively affecting wound healing and scarring. This study compared the safety and efficacy of hydrosurgical combined with autologous skin grafting to conventional excision combined with autologous skin grafting in patients with extremely severe burn.

Methods

Information of sixty burn patients with total body surface area (TBSA) > 50% treated at the first affiliated hospital of Anhui Medical University from January 2019 to August 2022 were analyzed. The patients were divided into a conventional debridement group (n = 37) and a hydrosurgical debridement group (n = 23) according to the approach used. The hydrosurgical debridement group and the conventional debridement group were compared from the difference between the duration of the first debridement surgery, wound healing time, the changes of red blood cells and hemoglobin concentration postoperative, total blood transfusion, hospitalization cost, skin grafting frequency, procalcitonin, wound bacterial culture, albumin and prealbumin.

Results

Information on age, gender, weight, inhalation injury, hypovolemic shock, preoperative procalcitonin, preoperative albumin, preoperative prealbumin, the operation frequency (n ≥ 3), preoperative trauma culture and postoperative trauma culture were compared between both groups (P > 0.05). Operative time and wound healing time were significantly shorter in patients with hydrosurgical debridement combined with autologous skin grafting than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while hospitalization costs were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). The changes of red blood cells and hemoglobin concentration during the postoperative period in the hydrosurgical debridement group were less significantly than those in the conventional debridement group (P < 0.05). The total amount of red blood cells transfused during hospitalization was significantly lower in the hydrosurgical debridement group than that in the conventional debridement group (P < 0.05), but the total amount of fresh frozen plasma transfused during hospitalization was not statistically significant between the two groups (P > 0.05). Albumin on the third day after surgery and prealbumin on the first, third and fifth day after surgery improved more significantly than those in the control group(P < 0.05), however, there were no significant differences between the two groups in albumin on the first and fifth postoperative days (P > 0.05). The PCT level in the conventional debridement group was significantly higher than that in the hydrosurgical debridement group on the first, third and fifth days after surgery(P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The hydrosurgical debridement group presented with shorter operative time, less blood loss during surgery, faster postoperative nutritional recovery, less postoperative inflammatory response and faster wounds healing, and did not increase the hospitalization cost, postoperative bacterial culture of the wounds and the number of skin grafting surgeries. In patients with extremely severe burn, hydrosurgical debridement combined with autologous skin grafting group is safer and more effective than those in the conventional debridement combined with autologous skin grafting group.

### Hydrosurgical and conventional debridement of burns: randomized clinical trial [^11483XMZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Although several studies have reported that hydrosurgery can be used maximally to preserve dermis, only one has reported histological evidence to support this in burns. Hyland et al. performed an RCT to study scar quality after hydrosurgical and conventional debridement in children with partial-thickness burns. They also confirmed greater loss of dermis in conventionally debrided burns via an analysis of histological specimens. They also found better scar scores in favour of the hydrosurgery group at 3 and 6 months postburn, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, they did not use a within-patient design, did not report the distribution of patient characteristics that may have influenced scar quality, and ended their follow-up at 6 months.

A recent Cochrane review reported low-quality evidence for the potential benefits of hydrosurgical debridement over conventional debridement that are desirable to clinicians, such as faster operating time, improved usability, fewer procedures, less blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. To reduce treatment costs, burn specialists often prefer to use a Weck knife in smaller burns. The current cost of the disposable Versajet headpiece is €141.86 ($167.55), while the costs of a reusable Weck knife guard and handle are €0.91 ($1.08) and €20.91 ($24.70), respectively. The cost of one sterilized, single-use Weck blade is €1.08 ($1.28). However, evidence for the cost-effectiveness of hydrosurgery in burns is limited and further research on its long-term benefits, such as fewer reconstructive surgery procedures, is necessary.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^111MGtaP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Results

The Versajet™ hydrosurgery system was used for soft tissue debridement in fifteen patients with a variety of wounds. Demographics, wound characteristics, and type of the reconstructive surgery are displayed in Table 1. The patients' age ranged from 18 to 55 years, with an average of 39.1 years. All patients had debridements performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. In ten patients, an adequately debrided wound bed was achieved with a single operative procedure. In four patients, two steps were required before the final reconstructive surgery. In one patient with long-standing recurrent sacral-iscial pressure and poor general status, after dry eschar was removed, two debridements were carried out followed by long term V. A.C. application. No postoperative infection was noted in any of the patients. In three patients, minor breakdown of the skin graft was observed; however, they healed with no surgical intervention. The estimated average time per hydrosurgical procedures was 15.5 minutes. For the cases presented, a standard handpiece with a 45 degree angled tip and a 14 mm working window was employed. The lowest power setting used for debridement was 2–3 (hand burn case: patient 2), and the highest power setting was 8–9 for debridement of a deep pressure sore (patient 6). No safety issues such as sharp injuries or splash contamination were reported during the use of the Versajet™.

### Treatment of deep partial thickness and indeterminate depth facial burn wounds with water-jet debridement and a biosynthetic dressing [^111xCWra]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Debriding deep thermal injury to face and neck can be particularly challenging with cold knife techniques. Timely healing, a precondition for minimal scarring, is dependant upon optimal wound bed preparation.

Objective

A new water-jet surgical tool (Versajet) (Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) has been designed for wound debridement. Ex vivo histologic analysis of depth of debridement on human skin confirmed that predictable and controlled depth of debridement could be obtained by adjusting apparatus settings.

Methods & Materials

We prospectively studied the versatility of this instrument for the treatment of deep and indeterminate depth face and neck burns. Wounds were then covered with either a biosynthetic (Biobrane) (Bertek Pharmaceuticals Inc) or cultured biosynthetic dressing (TransCyte).

Results

Patient follow-up demonstrated no adverse effects. Placement of biosynthetic dressings was compatible with water-jet debridement. Median healing time for wounds covered with biosynthetic dressings was 14 days, and 12 days for those which received the cultured biosynthetic dressing.

Conclusion

We have found the water-jet system to be a versatile instrument for surgical burn debridement with particular advantage in addressing the challenging and delicate contoured regions found in the face and neck. Accurate control of debridement depth facilitates wound bed preparation for simultaneous treatment with growth promoting biosynthetic dressings.

### Facial burn healing with a polylactic acid dermal matrix: a case report on wound modulation and graft-free epithelialization [^113LsEJB]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION AND RESULTS

A 53-year-old man experiencing homelessness presented to our burn unit 48 h after an alkali-based chemical assault to the face. He received initial decontamination at a community hospital before transfer for specialized care. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable but reported severe pain (9/10). Examination revealed complete epidermal and dermal loss, sparing the eyes but involving the right upper eyelid; the left eye had a prior enucleation (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Clinical Progression of a Facial Chemical Burn Following Treatment

- **Top Row (Left to Right)**: Initial Appearance Immediately After Surgical Debridement, Followed by Application of a Polylactic Acid Matrix on the Same Day. Then, Wound Progression at 1 and 2 Weeks Postapplication

- **Middle Row (Left to Right)**: Continued Healing at 3 Weeks and 4 Weeks, With the Latter Demonstrating Full Wound Closure. Next, Follow-Up Images at 6 and 12 Months, Highlighting Long-Term Outcomes

- **Bottom Row (Left to Right)**: Lateral View of the Wound, Beginning With the Initial Presentation, Progression at 4 Weeks, and Concluding With 6- and 12-Month Follow-Up Images

Tangential excision using the Versajet hydrosurgery system was performed for wound bed optimization. Histology confirmed mixed partial and full-thickness burns with necrosis, edema, and vascular injury (Figure 2). Digital planimetry (Swift Medical, Toronto, Canada) measured the burnt area at 38.5 cm², affecting functionally and cosmetically critical facial regions. Infrared thermography (IRT) scan using a FLIR T600 camera (Teledyne FLIR, Wilsonville, OR) showed Δ T > −3.5°C compared to adjacent skin, indicating poor healing potential and supporting histopathologic findings (Figure 3).

Patient 4

This was a 50-year-old female patient with a traumatic left elbow wound due to a motor vehicle accident. The soft tissue defect was 5 × 7 cm in size with exposed olecranon. Because of her additional abdominal injury, a wound vacuum assisted closure (Vacuum-assisted closure (V. A.C), KCI, San Antonio, TX) was placed. Within three days after VAC treatment, debridement with the hydrosurgery system (Power setting: 5) was performed followed by immediate reconstruction with lateral arm island flap (Fig. 11, 12, 13). Physical therapy was initiated at one week after the surgery. The patient regained elbow functions in 2 months.

Patient 5

This was a 30-year-old female patient with a traumatic degloving injury (15 × 25 cm) involving distal thigh and popliteal fossa extending to the lateral aspect of the knee on the right side. The mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle collision. The Versajet™ hydrosurgery system was used twice for wound debridement. The wound edges had 6–7 cm of dissection medially, laterally, and superiorly. The Versajet™ was also used for debridement under the dissected skin edges (Power setting: 6). The underneath of the avulsion skin flaps were tacked down to the wound bed to obliterate the dead space. The distal thigh wound was skin grafted, and the popliteal wound and lateral aspect of the knee were reconstructed with medial gastrocnemius muscle flap covered with split-thickness skin graft (Fig. 14, 15, 16). Minor wounds healed with no complications at three weeks.

The incidence of ≥ 95% eschar removal at the end of the topical treatment period for subjects in the NEXOBRID and gel vehicle groups is shown in Table 3.

The incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision) and time to ≥ 95% eschar removal for the NEXOBRID and SOC groups are shown in Table 4.

The median time to eschar removal was 1 day on the NEXOBRID arm and 3.8 days on the SOC arm.

The estimated median time to ≥ 95% wound closure for all TWs on a subject was 31 days for the NEXOBRID arm and 36 days for the SOC treatment arm. Subjects were not evaluated frequently enough after achieving ≥ 95% wound closure to adequately assess time to 100% wound closure.

Study 2 NEXOBRID was investigated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm trial, comparing NEXOBRID to SOC treatment in subjects with DPT and/or FT thermal burns of 5–24% BSA (Study 2; NCT00324311). SOC included both surgical and non-surgical methods for eschar removal per the investigators' discretion. The trial enrolled 182 subjects. The first subject at each site (26 subjects) was not randomized and was treated with NEXOBRID. The remaining 156 subjects were randomized to NEXOBRID or SOC. The efficacy assessments were analyzed on DPT burns only.

Demographics were similar across both arms. The mean age was 29.9 years. Approximately 80% of the study subjects were adults (≥ 18 years), 74% were male and 26% were female, 82% were White, 7% were other races, 6% were Black, and 5% were Asian.

The incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision) for the NEXOBRID and SOC groups is shown in Table 5.

In randomized subjects, the estimated median time to ≥ 95% wound closure was 33 days for the NEXOBRID arm and 24 days for the SOC treatment arm. Subjects were not evaluated frequently enough after achieving ≥ 95% wound closure to adequately assess time to 100% wound closure.

### Extravasation injury management for neonates and children: a systematic review and aggregated case series [^114f9jKS]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical

Surgical interventions, as shown in Figure 2c, were utilized in 22 studies. Surgical puncture, and surgical cleaning, were most routinely used among the studies. Moreover, debridement, fasciotomy, surgical excision/escharectomy, plastic surgical review, and skin graft, were also utilized. There were seven traditional/surgical debridements, three enzymatic debridements, three autolytic debridements, two mechanical debridements, and one Versajet™ hydrosurgery system debridement.

Dressings

The use of dressings as an intervention, as shown in Figure 2d, was evident within 21 studies. Moist gauze (saline/iodine) was the most used dressing, followed by foam, silicone‐based, silver, and hydrocolloid dressings. Dressings used throughout the studies were primarily used after the extravasation injury had been managed with alternative interventions. For example, in Ahmadli'sstudy, first aid measures were undertaken upon identifying the extravasation, such as removing the PIVC, applying a cold pack, elevating the site, and cleaning the site. Debridement then occurred, and multiple types of dressings were applied to subsequently manage the wound.

### Efficacy of hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting in the treatment of deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns: a two-year retrospective study [^116FjyvE]. Burns (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burn wounds often undergo tangential excision or escharectomy to expose healthy tissue, combined with skin grafting to promote wound healing. However, conventional tangential excision with the humby knife leads to inevitable damage to the dermis while excising burn tissue due to the lack of precision. Indeed, the preservation of dermal tissue is a key factor in determining wound healing and scar quality. The precision and tissue selectivity of the Versajet Hydrosurgical System has been established for excising burn tissue while preserving dermal tissue. In this study, we retrospectively compared the efficacy of "Hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting" and "Conventional tangential excision combined with skin grafting" in treating deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burn wounds to demonstrate that hydrosurgery improved the treatment of deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns.

Methods

A total of 86 patients with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness burns with a total burn surface area (TBSA) ≤ 25% from July 2018 to July 2020 were included in this study and were divided into experimental (hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting, n = 43) and control (conventional tangential excision combined with skin grafting, n = 43) groups. Parameters were analyzed, including the intraoperative blood loss volume per unit area of grafted skin, surgery duration, wound healing time, skin graft survival, and the treatment costs per unit of burned area. Scar assessment was performed at 1 year with the modified Vancouver Scar Scale linked with TBSA (mVSS-TBSA).

Result

No significant difference was found in male to female ratio, age, weight, TBSA, burn depth, skin grafting area (SKA), skin grafting methods, cases treated with carbon dioxide fractional laser or incidence of inhalation injury, and the incidence of hypovolemic shock between two groups(p > 0.05). Compared with the control group, patients treated with hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting experienced less intraoperative blood loss volume per unit area of grafted skin (p < 0.05). The mVSS-TBSA of patients that underwent hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting was significantly improved in comparison to the control group (p < 0.01). No significant difference was found in surgery duration, wound healing time, skin graft survival and treatment costs per unit of burned area between the two groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Hydrosurgical excision combined with skin grafting reduced intraoperative blood loss volume per unit area of grafted skin, improved scarring 1-year after injury, and did not increase the treatment costs per unit of burned area. This technique provides a novel alternative for managing deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burn wounds.

Study 3

NEXOBRID was investigated in the CIDS study which was an open label, randomized, controlled, two arm trial comparing NEXOBRID and standard of care (SOC) treatment in subjects 7 months to 18 years of age with DPT and/or FT thermal burns of ≥ 1% - 30% BSA (Study 3, NCT02278718). SOC included both surgical and nonsurgical methods for eschar removal per the investigator's discretion. Subjects on the NEXOBRID arm who had eschar remaining following the topical treatment period were treated with SOC. NEXOBRID was compared with SOC for the time to eschar removal and for the incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision).

A total of 145 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio (NEXOBRID:SOC) and 139 subjects were treated. The mean age was approximately 6 years, with a median of 3.4 years in the NEXOBRID group and 3.9 years in the SOC group. In the trial, 62% were male, 70% were White, 23% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, and 3% were other races; for ethnicity, 7% identified as Hispanic or Latino. Subjects had one or more target wounds (TWs) to be treated for eschar removal. The mean percentage BSA of all TWs per subject was 5.6%. The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had 1 TW (71.0% for NEXOBRID and 80.0% for SOC).

The median time to ≥ 95% eschar removal is shown in Table 6.

The incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision) is shown in Table 7.

The estimated median time to ≥ 95% wound closure for all target wounds on a subject was 32 days for the NEXOBRID arm and 34 days for the SOC treatment arm. The estimated median time reach 100% wound closure on a target wound level was 44 days for NexoBrid arm and 43 days for the SOC arm.

The efficacy of NEXOBRID for the eschar removal of deep partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness (FT) thermal burns has been investigated in two trials.

Study 1

NEXOBRID was investigated in the DETECT randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, three-arm trial, comparing NEXOBRID, standard of care (SOC), and gel vehicle treatment in subjects with DPT and/or FT thermal burns of 3–30% BSA (Study 1, NCT02148705). SOC included both surgical and non-surgical methods for eschar removal per the investigators' discretion. Subjects on the NEXOBRID and gel vehicle arms who had eschar remaining following the topical treatment period were treated with SOC. NEXOBRID was compared to gel vehicle for the incidence of ≥ 95% eschar removal at the end of the topical treatment period. NEXOBRID was also compared with SOC for the incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision) and time to eschar removal.

A total of 175 subjects were randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio (NEXOBRID: SOC: gel vehicle) and 169 subjects were treated. The mean age was 41 years, 70% of subjects were male and 30% were female, and 81% were White, 14% were Black or African American, 5% were other races, and 1% were Asian. Seventeen percent of subjects were Hispanic or Latino. Subjects had one or more target wounds (TWs) to be treated for eschar removal. The mean percentage BSA of all TWs per subject was 6.1%.

Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Data Collection and Analysis

Patients were prospectively entered into a registry for performance and quality improvement. After obtaining IRB approval, we then performed a retrospective data extraction from the EPIC electronic health record (EHR), which included clinical, photographic, throughput, and financial information. To minimize bias, the authors used only objective data obtained from the EHR. In addition to descriptive statistics, we compared burn to nonburn patients, using two-tailed, nonpaired Student t test with unequal variance for continuous data and χ² analysis for categorical data. P values < 0.05 were assigned statistical significance.

Surgical Technique

Wound Bed Preparation

FT wounds and mixed FT/PT wounds throughout the body underwent excisional preparation with a combination of scalpel, curette, scissors, and Versajet (Smith + Nephew, London, UK), removing necrotic and infected debris, back to healthy appearing, viable tissue. Hemostasis was achieved with a combination of direct pressure and epinephrine/thrombin solution, with only minimal use of electrocautery. Infected, contaminated, or questionably viable wounds were temporarily closed with xenograft, allograft, or synthetic skin substitute. Clean, mature wounds with good vascularity underwent one-stage, definitive closure with STSG and ASCS.

Calculation of STSG and ASCS Needed for Wound Closure

The total surface area of the wound was measured, and the STSG needed for closure (anticipating a 2:1 expansion from 3:1 meshing) was calculated by dividing this area by a factor of 2. The total volume of ASCS needed, based on an 80:1 expansion, to treat both the primary wound and the STSG donor site was determined by combining the surface area of both wounds and dividing this by a factor of 80. Each square centimeter of skin harvested for ASCS was used to cover 80 cm² of wound and reconstituted in 1 mL of buffer. As an example, a 500 cm² wound would require a 250 cm² donor site, to provide a functional 2-fold STSG expansion, plus a 9.375 cm² donor site, to provide an 80:1 ASCS expansion, used to spray over the primary wound and secondary STSG donor site (which combined would total 750 cm² + 9.375 cm²).

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^114b31mG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Few articles have been published about the hydrosurgery system. The high-powered waterjet is a unique device compared to the pulse irrigator, which is a low-energy waterjet. The high-powered parallel waterjet device has the ability to focus a high-powered stream of water into a high-energy cutting implement. Water dissection works by the Venturi effect. A jet of saline, propelled by a power console, travels across the operating window of a hand-held piece and then into a suction collector. This system of pressurized saline functions like a knife. The saline beam is aimed parallel to the wound so that the cutting mechanism is a highly controlled form of tangential excision.

We experienced many advantages utilizing the hydrosurgery system in fifteen patients. This single device technique combines lavage and sharp debridement instrumentation with single-handed operation due to holding and treating with one device. The device provided the control to hold targeted tissue during irrigation and excision, and importantly, the handpiece provided the ability to perform simultaneous debridement as well as removal of debris by aspiration. This helped keep the operative field cleaner and drier compared to conventional lavage techniques.

Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Inkjet-printed optical interference filters [^1119Dgw4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Optical interference filters (OIFs) are vital components for a wide range of optical and photonic systems. They are pivotal in controlling spectral transmission and reflection upon demand. OIFs rely on optical interference of the incident wave at multilayers, which are fabricated with nanometer precision. Here, we demonstrate that these requirements can be fulfilled by inkjet printing. This versatile technology offers a high degree of freedom in manufacturing, as well as cost-affordable and rapid-prototyping features from the micron to the meter scale. In this work, via rational ink design and formulation, OIFs were fully inkjet printed in ambient conditions. Longpass, shortpass, bandpass, and dichroic OIFs were fabricated, and precise control of the spectral response in OIFs was realized. Subsequently, customized lateral patterning of OIFs by inkjet printing was achieved. Furthermore, upscaling of the printed OIFs to A4 size (29.7 × 21.0cm²) was demonstrated.

### Experiences with waterjet hydrosurgery system in wound debridement [^113te7pb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Efficient debridement of traumatic wounds, pressure sores, burn wounds, and chronic non-healing wounds due to diabetes mellitus, venous insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease is an essential and crucial step in wound management. In this article, usage of a hydrosurgery system that utilizes high fluid technology is presented for debridement of various wounds in fifteen patients. Technical details and pitfalls are provided to facilitate clinical application of the technique. Inability to remove hard eschar and to debride the bone are two known drawbacks of the hydrosurgery system. Even though the hydrosurgery system cannot replace sharp techniques for desiccated eschar removal and other techniques for bone debridement, it can be an efficient alternative for soft tissue debridement in certain cases. We believe that this new tool will soon find greater applicability in our practice. However, its cost effectiveness needs to be studied in detail with well-controlled studies.

### High-throughput printing of combinatorial materials from aerosols [^114Pxqnq]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Materials hold pivotal roles in many scientific and technological innovations, and progress in developing new materials is key to the pursuit of solutions to grand societal challenges. Combinatorial material depositions (for example, cosputtering) have enabled rapid screening of new materials for electronics, magnetics, optics and energy-related applications. The sample-rich feature of these combinatorial material libraries facilitates elucidation of the composition–structure–property relationship and enables the rapid screening of materials over a vast range of compositions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic high-energy nature of laser or plasma excludes many materials (for example, colloidal particles, thermosensitive polymers) from use in the development of universal combinatorial material libraries. Additive manufacturing has emerged as a versatile method to fabricate materials of complex structure using micro- and nanoscale building blocks –. Recently several printing approaches, including inkjet printing, electrochemical printing and electrohydrodynamic redox printing, have been proposed for the fabrication of material libraries –. However, these methods still suffer from limited materials options and challenges in regard to the universal combination of different materials and the production of gradient material libraries, due to the lack of fast mixing mechanisms and the inability to rapidly vary mixing ratios.

### Development of fin-LEDs for next-generation inorganic displays using face-selective dielectrophoretic assembly [^111P4Tub]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Micro-light-emitting diodes offer vibrant colors and energy-efficient performance, holding promise for next-generation inorganic displays. However, their widespread adoption requires the development of cost-effective chips and low-defect pixelation processes. Addressing these challenges, nanorod-light-emitting diodes utilize inkjet and dielectrophoretic assembly techniques. Nevertheless, the small volume and edge-directed emission of nanorod-light-emitting diodes necessitate brightness and light extraction improvements. As an alternative, we propose dielectrophoretic-friendly fin-light-emitting diodes, designed to enhance brightness and light extraction efficiency through face-selective dielectrophoretic assembly technology. Our results confirm the potential for next-generation inorganic displays, with a wafer utilization ratio exceeding 90%, a vertical assembly ratio of 91.3%, and a pixel production yield of 99.93%. Moreover, blue fin-light-emitting diodes achieve an external quantum efficiency of 9.1% and a brightness of 8640cdm⁻² at 5.0V, which, even at this early stage, are comparable to existing technologies.

### Ultrafast 3D printing with submicrometer features using electrostatic jet deflection [^11753y56]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Additive manufacturing technologies based on layer-by-layer deposition of material ejected from a nozzle provide unmatched versatility but are limited in terms of printing speed and resolution. Electrohydrodynamic jetting uniquely allows generating submicrometer jets that can reach speeds above 1 m s⁻¹, but such jets cannot be precisely collected by too slow mechanical stages. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the voltage applied to electrodes located around the jet, its trajectory can be continuously adjusted with lateral accelerations up to 10⁶ m s⁻². Through electrostatically deflecting the jet, 3D objects with submicrometer features can be printed by stacking nanofibers on top of each other at layer-by-layer frequencies as high as 2000 Hz. The fast jet speed and large layer-by-layer frequencies achieved translate into printing speeds up to 0.5 m s⁻¹ in-plane and 0.4 mm s⁻¹ in the vertical direction, three to four orders of magnitude faster than techniques providing equivalent feature sizes.

### Clinical endpoints of needle-free jet injector treatment: an in depth understanding of immediate skin responses [^1163wPaD]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Interventions and sample collection

EPI was performed with an electronically‐controlled pneumatic jet injector (EnerJet2.0; PerfAction Technologies Ltd.) at 3, 4, 5, and 6 bar, (100 μl; n = 36), and injection volumes of 50, 100, and 130 μl (4 bar; n = 27). The EPI nozzle tip (Ø 0.2 mm) has a 5 mm distance to the skin surface, determined by the spacer. A spring loaded jet‐injector (Dermojet; AKRA) with a fixed pressure of 98 bar and injection volume of 100 μl was selected for SLI (n = 9). One researcher (MW) delivered a constant intradermal bolus of 100 μl by conventional needle injection with a 0.5 mL syringe with 29 G needle (n = 9, BD Micro‐Fine, 324892; Becton Dickinson). All injections with normal saline containing 0.1% of methylene blue (C. I. 52015; Merck Millipore) were divided over three different human tissue specimens and performed in triplicate to minimize bias due to variation in physical skin properties. Undelivered liquid on the skin was defined as residual surface fluid, and collected and measured using a lab pipette (0.5–10 µl; 10–100 µl). The skin papule border was manually contoured using a black marker for 3D analyses. Photographs were captured by digital camera (D5300; Nikon), and a 3D camera system (Antera 3D® CS; Miravex Limited) under standardized conditions including normal room lighting, fixed distance and perpendicular angle. Each skin papule was linearly incised directly at the entry point of injection, removed (2 cm × 1 cm), and mounted under slight pressure between two microscopic slides with the injection site facing upwards. A ruler was used for measurements of the immediate cutaneous distribution by two trained assessors (AM & AW) who measured the maximum dermal width and depth (dermis only), and the presence of dye deposition into the subcutaneous layer.

### A consensus statement on the use of digital twins in medicine [^1116spSx]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We take the findings as support for our recommendations as follows: people are generally positive towards DTs, but they want to keep agency with respect to whether or not to use this technology, which should be enabled. Healthcare professionals are expected to be sufficiently competent in using this technology for the benefit of patients, which should be fostered in curricula. People are, in principle, willing to provide the necessary resources (data, financial compensation models) to develop DTs; but private actors, who may actually develop those technologies, are confronted with considerable skepticism. To counteract this skepticism, the state and public institutions should have a key role in developing a health system that critically relies on DTs; including preserving options that do not need such technologies.

DT technology represents a clear departure from the core idea of today's healthcare system, which states that physicians and the research system that supports them are the ultimate arbiter not only on how to treat patients, but more importantly, on defining what constitutes a disease in the first place. This conceptualization of disease and treatment rationales is by necessity a human affair, typically the result of consensus-finding processes among physicians organized in specialist societies. While data-driven approaches, particular evidence-based medicine, are attempts to objectivize the process, a large swath of medicine is still a very human intuition-driven enterprise with vast differences in available care pathways and ultimately health outcomes. The core of this enterprise is an international, national, regional, or individual understanding of disease and treatment strategies. By necessity, the AI tools that are being introduced today reflect this situation, that is, the AI tools, trained on current medical data, are a mere reflection of current medical concepts, definitions, and approaches. Constrained as such, current AI cannot evolve beyond what is happening in medicine today. In contrast, DT technology, in its most advanced state, applies a predominately data-driven approach for predicting a future state given a patient's current health data. At its core, a DT should "know" the principles of how processes at different scales evolve over time, but it will not be constrained by them. Rather, DTs will use machine-derived states to trigger corrective actions in the form of health interventions. It is unclear at this point whether humans will be able to understand the meaning of these states, and whether these states can be translated into current medical concepts. This begs the question: if DTs will emerge as a key tool in healthcare, in the form of personal digital replicas guiding our treatment choices, what is the role of the traditional bearer of medical knowledge and wisdom, the physician? Can physicians remain the epistemic authority in healthcare, given that they operate using a scheme of thought that may no longer allow them to understand machine predictions of a patient's health state? How should patients deal with the technology, both in the role of data providers and consumers of DT services? Is there an emergent role for technology companies that build and maintain digital medical twins? And finally, what are sensible regulatory approaches to ensure fair and equitable access to the technology? Our paper provides possible answers to these questions, boldly proposing a future healthcare system with new stakeholders, such as tech companies and novel roles of traditional players like physicians, but also contrasting the current perspective of the population versus a different outlook on technological development. Realistically, changes will appear gradually, as will be the capabilities of the DT technology, which, in its first incarnation, will likely be built on today's AI capabilities using only little multi-scale simulations. The paper acknowledges this fact by discussing the near-, mid- and long-term effects of DT technology on the healthcare system.

While there have been innovations with shorter and thinner PNs, the pen needle hub design has largely remained the same, with the exception of two PNs, NovoFine® and NovoTwist®, developed by Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark). In the study reported here, we have evaluated an investigational PN (Nano™ 2nd Gen, also known by its "PRO" brand extension in many markets outside of the USA) developed by BD (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) which has an innovative hub face geometry, using patient-reported outcomes. This hub design was engineered with the aim to reduce the impact of variability in injection technique and improve the injection experience. Most PNs are designed with a cylindrical posted hub, while the investigational PN's hub is contoured with a re-engineered surface area. In addition, this new PN includes a redesigned inner shield that includes tactile ridges and a remodeled outer cover with improved proportions and attachment grips, with the aim to improve the overall injection experience (Fig. 1).

WARNINGS

Individual allergenic extract treatment vial is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of allergenic extracts for immunotherapy and the emergency care of anaphylaxis, or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist. Individual allergenic extract treatment vials are not directly interchangeable with other allergenic extracts. The initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the dosage and administration section of this insert. Patients being switched from other types of extract to individual treatment vials should be started as though they were coming under treatment for the first time. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician's office if reaction symptoms occur. As with all allergenic extracts, severe systemic reactions may occur. In certain individuals, these reactions may be life-threatening. Patient should be observed for at least 20 minutes following treatment and emergency measures as well as personnel trained in their use should be immediately available in the event of a life-threatening reaction.

This product should not be injected intravenously. Deep subcutaneous routes have proven to be safe. See the warnings, precautions, adverse reactions and overdosage sections below.

### Wound healing effect of nonthermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet on a rat burn wound model: a preliminary study [^116HbwSX]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Globally, there are approximately 6 million patients seeking burns medical service per year. Burn injury is a common type of traumatic injury, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, burn wound care is one of the most expensive treatment modalities, due to the cost needed for long hospital stay and rehabilitation, as well as wound and scar treatment. In order to hasten burned wound healing and epithelialization and to prevent infection and wound progression to the deeper skin layers, adequate burn wound care is necessary. For this purpose, various treatment methods and materials have been studied and developed. However, evidence-based methods and materials for burn wound care are still not widely available. Therefore, burn wound care is one of the most challenging research sectors of medicine in this 21st century.

Recently, a new technology, plasma medicine, has emerged to offer new solutions in wound care. "Plasma" refers to the fourth state of matter. When a gas is heated or subjected to high electrical force, electrons are accelerated, resulting in collision with the atoms and molecules, knocking off and freeing other electrons, and thus creating positively charged atomic and molecular ions. This mixture of uncharged atoms, molecules, and ions, as well as electrons, is what is referred to as "plasma". The collision of these electrons with the air substance such as O₂, H₂O, N₂, etc. will eventually generate reactive species and are utilized for medical pursposes. Few applications of plasma have been explored, including bacterial inactivation, blood coagulation, wound healing, tissue regeneration, cancer treatment, dentistry, and chronic ulcer treatment. Moreover, plasma was proved to effectively reduce populations of many types of bacteria and yeasts.

Plasma also contributes to wound healing by inducing cell proliferation, migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts for wound re-epithelialization, as well as by inducing wound healing-related genes. Plasma effectiveness for healing of common cutaneous and chronic ulcer wounds has been previously reported. Based on these reported plasma benefits in wound healing, we were intrigued about the effect of plasma medicine on third-degree burn wounds, as the process of burn injury differs from that of other injuries. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the effects of plasma treatment on third-degree burn wounds.

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a nonthermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (NAPPJ) in third-degree burn wounds treatment on a brass comb burn wound rat model.
