## Question

John trains for ultramarathons. He starts only able to run 8 hours straight but eventually increases that by 75%. He also increases his speed of 8 mph by 4 mph. How far can he run now?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how far John can run now after increasing his endurance time by 75% and his speed by 4 mph from an initial 8 hours and 8 mph, respectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the new duration after a 75% increase. Then, I should verify the new speed after adding 4 mph. Finally, I will multiply the new duration by the new speed to get the updated distance, and I should double-check the units and arithmetic to avoid errors.

> Let me first confirm the new duration. A 75% increase on 8 hours is 8 × 1.75, which equals 14 hours. Wait, let me verify that calculation: 8 × 0.75 is 6, and 8 + 6 is indeed 14 hours, so the new duration is 14 hours.

> Next, I should review the new speed. Adding 4 mph to 8 mph gives 12 mph. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not mixing units; the problem is stated in miles per hour, so 8 mph + 4 mph is 12 mph, which is correct.

> Now, I will calculate the new distance using distance equals speed times time. Distance equals 12 mph multiplied by 14 hours, which is 168 miles. I need to ensure the units cancel correctly: miles per hour times hours gives miles, so 168 miles is the correct unit and magnitude.

> But wait, what if I misapplied the percentage increase? Let me reconsider: a 75% increase means multiplying by 1.75, not adding 0.75 to the original number, which would be incorrect; 8 + 0.75 would be 8.75, which is wrong, so the correct new duration is 14 hours, confirming the prior step.

> Final answer: John can now run 168 miles.

---

John can now run **168 miles**. This is calculated by increasing his original 8-hour duration by 75% to 14 hours and increasing his speed from 8 mph to 12 mph; distance equals speed multiplied by time, so 12 mph × 14 hours = 168 miles.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Original duration | 8 hours |
| 2 | Increase duration by 75% | 8 hours × 1.75 = 14 hours |
| 3 | Original speed | 8 mph |
| 4 | Increase speed by 4 mph | 8 mph + 4 mph = 12 mph |
| 5 | Calculate new distance | 12 mph × 14 hours = 168 miles |

---

## Conclusion

After training, John can now run **168 miles** at his improved speed and endurance.

Importance of endurance

Our findings demonstrate the strong sensitivity of performance to endurance. For example, a runner with a velocity of v m = 5 m s −1 can improve his/her marathon time from 3 h 27 min 38 s to 2 h 53 min 8 s by doubling endurance from E l = 3 to E l = 6 (corresponding to a change in the one-hour utilization from 79 to 87% of VO 2max), without any change in VO 2, max or running economy. We also find that faster runners tend to race more consistently over all race distances than slower runners, highlighted by the dependence of the prediction error Δ T m on the marathon finishing time (see Fig. 4 b). For example, within our fastest group of runners with a marathon time below 160 min, the prediction error was typically less than ± 2.5%. This observation supports our explanation for the observed uncertainty in the endurance parameter E l.

Quantifying exposure with external training load

External metrics for training load include time spent, distance covered or steps taken while running. Distance and duration are easy to measure and understand, but from a biomechanical perspective, steps taken while running may be a better estimate of the volume of mechanical loading faced by the body. Running speed is the primary method of quantifying the intensity of an external load, although the caveats discussed above regarding the relationship between pace and internal load.

This study challenges the use of traditional load monitoring approaches, including the ACWR in the context of running-related injury occurrence. The single-session paradigm is therefore suggested as a novel approach to detecting deleterious spikes in running distance. Runners should avoid running a distance in their current session that exceeds 10% of the longest distance covered in the previous 30 days. However, progressions up to 10% are not necessarily safe either and carry a degree of risk. Although not statistically significant, a progression between 1% and 10% translated into an increased rate of 19% (95% CI: −10% to 57%, p = 0.22) compared with regression or progression up to 1% (results not shown in table 1). This is confirmed in figure 3 where progressions up to 10% appear to slightly increase the risk of injury. The current findings apply to a single running session and do not account for continuous progression over multiple sessions. For example, if the longest distance covered by a runner in the past 30 days was 10 km, then running 11 km, 12.1 km and 13.3 km in subsequent sessions within the same week, despite each reflecting a 10% increase, may still be considered excessive due to insufficient recovery time. Therefore, determining a safe progression in kilometres involves considering various factors beyond only the longest distance covered in the past 30 days.

The strengths of the present study include its considerably large sample size of 5205 runners, or approximately five times larger than the largest sample reported in previous prospective cohort studies, which have typically ranged from 100 to 1000 participants. Further strengths include the following: (1) the prospective study design, which includes an up to 18-month follow-up period allowing for the assessment of exposure information prior to outcome data; (2) the inclusion of objectively-measured time-varying exposure rather than averaged information on running data; and (3) recruitment of English-speaking runners from more than 87 different countries facilitated via a productive partnership with Garmin.

### How much running is too much? Identifying high-risk running sessions in a 5200-person cohort study [^116ActTQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study has revealed that a significant dose-response relationship exists between changes in single-session distance and running-related injuries in a cohort of 5205 adult runners, predominantly males from Europe and North America. Notably, a spike > 10% in single-session running distance significantly increased the rate of overuse running-related injuries, with the risk sharply rising when the distance more than doubled. Spikes in the ACWR, traditionally used in research and by industry, and spikes in the week-to-week ratio approach were not associated with an increased injury rate. Coaches and healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, allied health services and orthopaedic specialists may consider using a session-specific cut-off below 10% to ensure the health and safety of runners and patients.

### How much running is too much? Identifying high-risk running sessions in a 5200-person cohort study [^1116ziJs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As the injury rate as a function of relative change in running distance deviated from a linear relationship, relative changes were categorised into one of the following five transition states: (1) regression (running less than the longest run), or up to 10% progression (reference); (2) small spike corresponding to a progression between > 10% and 30%; (3) moderate spike corresponding to a progression between > 30% and 100%; (4) large spike corresponding to a progression above 100%; and (5) not possible (NP) to calculate a relative change since the denominator was zero (NP-state). A 10% cut-off was used given the significance of the '10% rule' in running communities, whereas a 30% increase was selected since progression in weekly averaged running distance exceeding this amount has been associated with increased risk of injury. A 100% cut-off was chosen as it represents doubling in running distance. As cut-off values can be discussed, the relative injury hazard as a function of change in running distance as a continuous variable will be visualised in the results section.

In addition to the calculation of single-session changes, the uncoupled ACWR was calculated using the most recent 1-week acute workload (sum of distance in all running sessions) and the prior 3-week chronic workload as described by Gabbett et al. Finally, the week-to-week ratio was calculated using the same 1-week acute workload as used in the ACWR divided by the sum of distance in all running sessions in the week prior to this as described by Nielsen et al. For ACWR and week-to-week ratios, the same cut-offs as described above for calculation of change in single-session running distance were used when categorising runners into a transition state after each running session.

Correlation with training

Finally, we compared physiological profiles to running activities within a training season. There exist a few studies of the relation between training volume and intensity, improvements of aerobic fitness and performance. For example, it has been stated that running at velocity v m might represent an optimal stimulus for improving endurance. There is also evidence supporting that a relatively large percentage of low-intensity training over a long period improves performance during highly intense endurance events. It has been argued that running velocity at lactate threshold is the best physiological predictor for distance running performance.

To investigate the effect of training distance and speed, relative to the velocity v m, we selected consistent racing seasons defined by having a mean race time prediction error below 5%. Figure 5 a shows that as the total training distance d train of the training season increases, v m increases on average linearly, with a weak saturation trend at largest d train. Several studies have demonstrated an increased v m due to endurance training. A faster velocity v m can be achieved by a better running economy and/or an increase in MAP. We hypothesize that longer training distance has generated improved running economy, in agreement with earlier observations in a group of eleven well-trained long distance runners. Our analysis provides a statistically significant, quantitative relation between training distance and speed at MAP, v m, for ~22,000 training seasons. Another explanation for this relation could be that fitter runners with a larger MAP and hence higher v m log more kilometer during their training. Unfortunately, we could not measure v m at the beginning and the end of the training season independently from two different racing seasons or time trials. We also found a linear decrease of v m with the mean relative training intensity between 50% and about 90% of v m, as shown in Fig. 5 b. Our findings can be interpreted as faster runners train typically at lower relative intensities which is consistent with high-intensity performance improvement due to low-intensity training. The range of training velocities increases with larger v m which reflects a wider range of accessible intensities between minimal (jogging) and maximal speed. For example, a runner with v m = 4 m s −1 typically (within one standard deviation) trains between 64 and 84% of v m or MAP, while a runner with v m = 5 m s −1 trains typically up to 66% of v m so that both runners have an almost identical upper pace ~5 min km −1 for the majority of their runs. Slow runners must train at a relative high intensity if they want to avoid a transition to walking. It is important to realize that these typical ranges do not include fast, high-intensity workouts which account only for a small fraction of total training volume. However, high-intensity sessions involve also resting phases that can reduce the average velocity when timer is not stopped, potentially explaining observed intensities below ~50% of v m.

### Run clever-No difference in risk of injury when comparing progression in running volume and running intensity in recreational runners: a randomised trial [^113ScyCp]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Participants

Healthy recreational runners, between 18 and 65 years of age, who owned an iOS-based or Android-based phone were eligible for inclusion. Recreational runners were defined as runners with a weekly running frequency of 1–3 sessions during the past six months. Information on eligibility was collected prior to baseline using an internet-based questionnaire. Questionnaires submitted were assessed using the following exclusion criteria: injured within the past six months, pregnant or vigorous physical activity contraindicated. Eligible participants received verbal information by telephone and were instructed on the importance of following the running schedule strictly and to quantify their running through GPS.

Interventions

In both schedules, running frequency was three times per week and the periodisation was divided into 4-week blocks with structured progression/regression. In the first week in each 4-week block, weekly running volume would progress 23% and the last week running would regress 10%. In the 8-week preconditioning period, all participants followed the same running schedule. Then, the schedules differed in the following manner during the 16-week intervention period: in Sch-I, participants increased the weekly volume of running at an intensity (minutes per kilometre) equal to or above a VO2max of 88% (hard). In Sch-V, participants increased the total running volume equal to or below a VO2max of 80% (easy). Detailed information on the content of the running schedules is presented in a protocol article.

Compliance

In an attempt to improve compliance to the interventions, running intensity was determined individually using an estimated VO2max. The VO2max estimation, which was based on an algorithm described by Jack Daniels, required each participant to perform an individual running test (each person could choose between 1500 m, Coopers test, or 5000 m), which was administered through the smartphone application at baseline and on a 8-week interval during follow-up. After estimation of the VO2max, the mobile application provided real-time, individualised feedback on the distance covered, the distance remaining and the running intensity (minutes per kilometre) to each runner during running. If a participant ran too fast or too slow, the mobile vibrated and an audio-alarm told him/her to slow down or speed up. If he/she ran according to the scheduled pace, they were told they did fine.

Abstract

Objectives

We explored whether a spike in running distance during a single session or over 1 week, compared with the preceding period, was associated with increased risk of running-related overuse injury.

Methods

Adult runners were recruited for an 18-month cohort study. Three training-related exposures were defined based on a relative change in running distance, using data collected via Garmin devices: (1) session-specific running distance relative to the longest distance run in the past 30 days; (2) 1-week period relative to the preceding 3 weeks using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR); (3) 1-week period using a week-to-week ratio. Runners were categorised into one of four time-varying states: (1) regression, or up to 10% increase (reference); (2) 'small spike' between > 10% and 30% increase; (3) 'moderate spike' between > 30% and 100% increase; and (4) 'large spike' > 100% increase. Outcome was self-reported overuse running-related injury. A multistate Cox regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRR).

Results

Among 5205 runners (mean age 45.8 years, SD = 10.4; 22% female), a total of 1820 (35%) sustained a running-related injury during 588 071 sessions. Significantly increased rates were identified for small spikes (HRR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.05, p = 0.01)), moderate spikes (HRR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.16 to 2.00, p < 0.01)) and large spikes (HRR = 2.28 (95% CI: 1.50 to 3.48, p < 0.01)) in single-session running distance. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for the ACWR. No relationship was identified for the week-to-week ratio.

Conclusion

A significant increase in the rate of running-related overuse injury was found when the distance of a single running session exceeded 10% of the longest run undertaken in the last 30 days.

### Effect of anticipation during unknown or unexpected exercise duration on rating of perceived exertion, affect, and physiological function [^111wiAJg]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of unknown exercise duration and an unexpected increase in exercise duration on rating of perceived exertion (RPE), affect, and running economy during treadmill running.

Methods

Sixteen well trained male and female runners completed three bouts of treadmill running at 75% of their peak treadmill running speed. In the first trial, they were told to run for 20 minutes and were stopped at 20 minutes (20 MIN). In another trial, they were told to run for 10 minutes, but at 10 minutes were told to run for a further 10 minutes (10 MIN). In the final trial, they were not told for how long they would be running but were stopped after 20 minutes (unknown, UN). During each of the running bouts, RPE, oxygen consumption (ml/kg/min), heart rate (beats/min), stride frequency (min(-1)), affect scores (arbitrary units), and attentional focus (percentage associative thought scores) were recorded.

Results

RPE increased significantly between 10 and 11 minutes in the 10 MIN compared with the 20 MIN and UN trials (p < 0.05). The affect score decreased significantly between 10 and 11 minutes in the 10 MIN compared with the 20 MIN trial (p < 0.05). Running economy, as measured by oxygen consumption, was significantly lower in the UN compared with the 20 MIN trial from 10 to 19 minutes (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The change in RPE between 10 and 11 minutes in the 10 MIN trial suggests that RPE is not purely a measure of physical exertion, as treadmill speed was maintained at a constant pace both before and after the unexpected increase in exercise duration. The associated changes in affect score at similar times in the 10 MIN trial supports the hypothesis that RPE has an affective component.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^116V35N9]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM staged return to activity after exertional heat stroke (EHS) outlines seven sequential stages from medical recovery to full sport participation. Stage 1 includes activities of daily living for 1 to 2 wk with a gradual increase in home activities without fatigue. Stage 2 uses a self‑paced comfortable walk in low heat stress, with return to practice as a walk‑through if conditions are not stressful or in an air‑conditioned area. Stage 3 advances to walking at 3.5 mph in low heat stress for 60 min at HR < 140 bpm or < 70% of age adjusted Maximal HR. Stage 4 adds walk and run in low heat stress with 60 min of progressively increasing run to walk ratio until constant run for 60 min. Stage 5 runs in ambient warm or hot conditions with 60 min of progressively increasing run until constant run for 60 min. Stage 6 participates in practice in ambient conditions, initially in sports‑specific drills with equipment then progressing to training and scrimmage. Stage 7 is return to sport with normal game or competition in ambient conditions, exemplified by Meet 1 — run to finish the race and Meet 2 — race to place in the race.

### Long-term health issues in ultraendurance runners: should we be concerned? [^116BsFQ8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Participation in ultraendurance running (UER) has increased considerably, especially over the past 20 years the participation worldwide has risen from 5000 in 2000 to 300 000 in 2017. It includes running distances over 42.195 km, timed events over 6 hours duration or multiday or multistage events. Additionally, there is also an important increase in youth UER participation under the ages of 19 years. The long-term impact on human health due to extreme exercise bouts, such as UER, is largely unknown.

Research in UER has primarily focused on acute physiological, biochemical and medical alterations immediately or shortly after UER events but long-term health effects have rarely been investigated. UER is considered one of the sports that causes the most functional and structural damage due to its high intensity and volume.UER usually affects anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory responses leading to several acute preclinical and clinical issues. In this editorial, we aim to discuss some of the potential long-term health implications of UER based on central body systems.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^116xHJbn]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

CS is a physiological threshold with the potential to assess athletic ability. In this study, we investigated whether CS determined from raw training data logged into a fitness application can be used to predict performance and offer insight into pacing in a marathon race. The main findings from this study were as follows: (i) it seems feasible to estimate CS from raw training data, and the estimates were sufficiently accurate to be useful for predicting athletic performance; (ii) the average runner completed their marathon at ~85% of their estimated CS, with faster runners achieving speeds that were on average closer to, but still below, their estimated CS; and (iii) CS may be useful to monitor pacing during a marathon, as runners who perform the early part of the marathon (2–16 km) faster than 94% of their CS were associated with a slower second-half time and a greater likelihood of experiencing a slowdown greater than 25% in the final stages of the race (> 30 km).

### The association between changes in weekly running distance and running-related injury: preparing for a half marathon [^115E52w9]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden changes in training load may play a key role in the development of running-related injury (RRI). Because the injury mechanism depends on the runner's musculoskeletal load capacity, the running schedule followed prior to sudden change in training load may influence the amount of change that a runner can tolerate before the runner is at a higher risk of RRI.

Objectives

To investigate the association between change in weekly running distance and RRI, and to examine whether the association may be modified by the running schedule the runner follows.

Methods

Two hundred sixty-one healthy (noninjured) runners were included in this prospective cohort study over a period of 14 weeks. Data on running activity were collected daily and objectively, using a global positioning system watch or smartphone. Instances of RRIs were collected using weekly e-mailed questionnaires. Primary exposure was defined as changes in weekly running distance. Data were analyzed with time-to-event models that produced cumulative risk difference as the measure of association.

Results

A total of 56 participants (21.5%) sustained an RRI during the 14-week study period. Twenty-one days into the study period, significantly more runners were injured when they increased their weekly running distance by 20% to 60% compared with those who increased their distance by less than 20% (risk difference, 22.6%; 95% confidence interval: 0.9%, 44.3%; P = 0.041). No significant difference was found after 56 and 98 days. No significant effect-measure modification by running schedule was found.

Conclusion

Significantly more runners were injured 21 days into the study period when they increased their weekly running distances by 20% to 60% compared with those who increased their distances by less than 20%.

### Running to breaking point? The relationship between 1.5-mile run time and injury risk in female recruits during British army basic training [^112p2yFu]. BMJ Military Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The 1.5-mile best-effort run is used in the British Army to assess the fitness of all recruits and trained service personnel by means of the physical fitness assessment (PFA). The 1.5-mile run is a basic measure of fitness and slower times have been associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury (MSkI), particularly during this early stage of training. The aim of this study was to establish whether 1.5-mile run times were associated with subsequent MSkIs among female recruits during their 14-week basic training.

Method

Retrospective data were analysed from female recruits who had undertaken basic military training between June 2016 and October 2017. This included retrieving the results of their week 1 PFA; recording the type, cause and week of MSkI if they had sustained one; and noting down their outcome from basic training. Run times were statistically analysed in relation to MSkI occurrence of 227 female recruits using binomial logistic regression with an accepted alpha level of p value < 0.05.

Results

1.5-mile run time predicted risk of MSkI (χ 2 (1) = 12.91, p < 0.0005) in female recruits. The mean run time for injury-free recruits was faster than for injured recruits (12min 13s compared with 12min 43s). Every 10s increase in run time was associated with an 8.3% increase in risk of injury.

Conclusion

Slower 1.5-mile best-effort run time, as a surrogate of aerobic fitness, is associated with increased risk of MSkI in female recruits during basic training.

### Is withdrawing treatment really more problematic than withholding treatment? [^112C6fTG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Far more people will receive ventilation if an ICU is running at 100% capacity but ventilation is withdrawn from some patients than if an ICU is running at 80% capacity but ventilation is not withdrawn from patients once it is commenced. This would mean that in hypothetical 1, both John and Donald could be ventilated if there were available ventilators. But if the situation in hypothetical 2 then arose, ventilation could be withdrawn from one of them to accommodate Arthur. This gives everyone the greatest possible opportunity to receive ventilation. Differentiating between withdrawing and withholding treatment would inhibit such an approach because it discourages the withdrawal of treatment and so encourages pre-emptive rationing that may ultimately prove unnecessary.

Delaying decisions causes deaths

If the MDU statement was followed, it is likely to result in more deaths and avoidable deaths. In the situation envisaged in hypothetical 2, the health system would be in crisis and choices like the choice between Arthur and John would need to be made every day and across the country. Even if the courts had the capacity to hear that many cases, the delay caused by preparing for and making a court application would result in patients deteriorating and dying while they waited for a decision about ventilation. This would not occur in the context of systematic decision-making to ensure the most effective use of resources. Instead, who received ventilation would be almost random, with those who arrived first having a greater opportunity.

Concern about this occurring is likely to further encourage hospitals to ration ventilators pre-emptively, in the manner described in the previous section. Such an approach will lead to underutilisation of available ventilators.

### Leisure-time running reduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk [^116RZyhC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although running is a popular leisure-time physical activity, little is known about the long-term effects of running on mortality. The dose-response relations between running, as well as the change in running behaviors over time, and mortality remain uncertain.

Objectives

We examined the associations of running with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks in 55,137 adults, 18 to 100 years of age (mean age 44 years).

Methods

Running was assessed on a medical history questionnaire by leisure-time activity.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 15 years, 3,413 all-cause and 1,217 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Approximately 24% of adults participated in running in this population. Compared with nonrunners, runners had 30% and 45% lower adjusted risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, with a 3-year life expectancy benefit. In dose-response analyses, the mortality benefits in runners were similar across quintiles of running time, distance, frequency, amount, and speed, compared with nonrunners. Weekly running even < 51 min, < 6 miles, 1 to 2 times, < 506 metabolic equivalent-minutes, or < 6 miles/h was sufficient to reduce risk of mortality, compared with not running. In the analyses of change in running behaviors and mortality, persistent runners had the most significant benefits, with 29% and 50% lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, compared with never-runners.

Conclusions

Running, even 5 to 10 min/day and at slow speeds < 6 miles/h, is associated with markedly reduced risks of death from all causes and cardiovascular disease. This study may motivate healthy but sedentary individuals to begin and continue running for substantial and attainable mortality benefits.

### Reliability of time-to-exhaustion versus time-trial running tests in runners [^115xMk3R]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Both time-to-exhaustion (TTE) and time-trial (TT) exercise tests are commonly used to assess exercise performance, but no study has directly examined the reliability of comparable tests in the same subjects.

Purpose

To evaluate the reliability of comparable TTE and TT treadmill running tests of high and moderately high exercise intensity in endurance-trained male distance runners, and to validate Hinckson and Hopkins TT prediction methods using log-log modeling from TTE results.

Methods

After familiarization tests, eight endurance-trained male distance runners performed, in a randomized, counterbalanced order, eight trials consisting of two 5-km TT and two 1500-m TT, and four TTE tests run at a speed equivalent to the average speed attained during both the 5-km and 1500-m TT distances.

Results

Typical error of the estimate (TEE) expressed as a coefficient of variation for the 5-km TT, 5-km TTE, 1500-m TT, and 1500-m TTE were 2.0, 15.1, 3.3, and 13.2%, respectively. The standard error of the estimate for predicted TT running speed using log-log modeling from TTE results was 0.67%, and the predicted versus criterion reliability of this method revealed TEE values of 1.6% and 2.5% for the prediction of 5-km and 1500-m TT, respectively.

Conclusion

The variability of 5-km and 1500-m TT tests was significantly less than for similar TTE treadmill protocols. Despite the greater variability of the TTE tests, log-log modeling using the TTE test results reliably predicted actual TT performance.

### Importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice: a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115rUTZz]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Low baseline CRF (≤ 9 METs) — in women aged 45 to 75 years in DREW training at heart rates equal to 50% peak/maximal VO2 with different physical activity amounts produced dose-related improvements; increases in CRF were 0.6, 0.9, and 1.9 mL·kg−1·min−1 (4.2%, 6.2%, 8.2%) for programs requiring 4, 8, and 12 kcal/kg body weight per week, respectively, with benefits achieved at ≤ 50% CRF over 6 months when baseline peak/maximal VO2 was 4 to 6 METs (15.5 ± 2.8 mL·kg−1·min−1).

### A consensus definition of running-related injury in recreational runners: a modified Delphi approach [^115z1Uwh]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Delphi study.

Objective

To reach a consensus definition of running-related injury in recreational runners through a modified Delphi approach.

Background

Many studies have suggested the need for a standardized definition of running-related injury to provide uniformity to injury surveillance in running.

Methods

We invited 112 researchers from running-related injury studies identified in a previous systematic review to classify words and terms frequently used in definitions of running-related injury in an online form during 3 rounds of study. In the last round, participants were asked to approve or disapprove the consensus definition. We considered an agreement level of at least 75% to be a consensus.

Results

Thirty-eight participants agreed to participate in the study. The response rates were 94.7% (n = 36) for the first round, 83.3% (n = 30) for the second round, and 86.7% (n = 26) for the third round. A consensus definition of running-related injury was reached, with 80% of participants approving the following: "Running-related (training or competition) musculoskeletal pain in the lower limbs that causes a restriction on or stoppage of running (distance, speed, duration, or training) for at least 7 days or 3 consecutive scheduled training sessions, or that requires the runner to consult a physician or other health professional".

Conclusion

The proposed standardized definition of running-related injury could assist in standardizing the definitions used in sport science research and facilitate between-study comparisons. Future studies testing the validity of the proposed consensus definition, as well as its accurate translation to other languages, are also needed.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^117NK7Vq]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Critical velocity and lactate threshold in sustained endurance performance: Sustained performances in distance running, cycling, and swimming are related to the critical velocity and lactate threshold. Although absolute VO2max and the highest sustainable performance velocities are larger in males, there is minimal sex difference in the relative critical velocity between highly trained distance runners who sustain running for several hours at ~85%–90% VO2max. In nonelite athletes, the absolute critical threshold of running speed or cycling power is typically higher for males, but the hyperbolic relationship between relative high power and task duration is similar.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^113Lq1pG]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Continuous straight-line or shuttle run tests — field-based alternatives have been developed with the aim of determining the endurance exercise capacity and/or indirectly estimating VO2max. These tests integrate VO2max, running economy, and lactate threshold kinetics; however, straight-line tests do not take into account the importance of sport-specific movement proficiency.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^116iwap1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

The results from this study suggest runners who completed the initial part of the marathon closer to their CS were more likely to experience difficulties later in the race, quantified as a positive relative split (i.e. slowing down in the second half of the race) and also as the percentage of athletes who experienced a significant slowdown in the final stages of the race. The results reported in the current study showed a positive correlation between BS relative to CS and subsequent impairment in performance, irrespective of gender and age category. Adopting an even split has been suggested as the best approach for endurance events, and large-scale studies have already suggested that an even split is optimal for endurance performance. The data presented in the current study suggest that such even pace should be close to, but below, the CS. For example, runners who complete an evenly paced race (defined as a race in which the first-half time is within 2%, faster or slower, than the second-half time) do so by running at a speed that is ~88% of their CS, whereas runners whose pacing falls outside of this range completed their race at ~84% of their CS. The results of the present study suggest that speed in the first half of the marathon should stay within ~94% of CS, or athletes risk having to disproportionately slowdown in the second half of the marathon.

The results also showed that although no differences were observed between younger and older athletes, males experienced a greater slowdown in the second half of the marathon, and severe slowdowns > 25% occurred more frequently compared with females. This is consistent with research showing that female runners tend to pace their marathons more evenly than male runners and that they are less susceptible to severe slowdowns and hitting the wall when compared with male marathoners.

### Bioenergetic constraints on tactical decision making in middle distance running [^114iLd6K]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The highest velocity that a runner can sustain during middle distance races is defined by the intersection of the runner's individual velocity-time curve and the distance-time curve. The velocity-time curve is presumably fixed at the onset of a race; however, whereas the race distance is ostensibly fixed, the actual distance-time curve is not. That is, it is possible for a runner to run further than the race distance if he or she runs wide on bends in track races. In this instance, the point of intersection of the individual velocity-time curve and the distance-time curve will move downwards and to the right, reducing the best average velocity that can be sustained for the distance.

Methods

To illustrate this point, the race tactics used by the gold and silver medallists at 800 m and 5000 m in the Sydney Olympics were analysed. The paths taken by the runners were carefully tracked and the total distance they covered during the races and the average velocity they sustained over the distances they actually covered were calculated.

Results

In both the Olympic 800 m and 5000 m finals, for example, the winner was not the runner who ran at the highest average velocity in the race. Rather, the winners of these races were able to husband their metabolic resources to better effect by running closer to the actual race distance.

Conclusions

Race results in middle distance running events are dependent not just on the energetic potential of the runners at the start of the race and their strategy for pace allocation, but also on the effect of their tactical approach to positioning on the total distance covered in the race. Middle distance runners should be conscious of minimising the distance covered in races if they wish to optimise their performance.

### Leisure-time running reduces the risk of incident type 2 diabetes [^11617h4L]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined the overall association as well as the dose-response relationship between leisure-time running and incident type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Participants were 19,347 adults aged 18–100 years who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at baseline, and who received at least 2 extensive preventive medical examinations between 1974 and 2006. Running and other types of aerobic physical activity were assessed by self-reported leisure-time activities. Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), physician diagnosis, or insulin use.

Results

During an average follow-up of 6.5 years, 1015 adults developed type 2 diabetes. Approximately 29.5% of adults participated in leisure-time running at baseline. Runners had a 28% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.84) lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with nonrunners during follow-up. The HRs (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes were 0.98 (0.75–1.28), 0.69 (0.51–0.92), 0.62 (0.45–0.85), 0.78 (0.59–1.04), and 0.57 (0.42–0.79) across quintiles of running time (minutes/week) compared with nonrunners after adjusting for potential confounders, including levels of nonrunning aerobic physical activity. Similar dose-response relationships between running distance (miles/week), frequency (times/week), total amount (MET-minutes/week), and speed (mph) were also observed.

Conclusions

Participating in leisure-time running is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults. Consistent linear dose-response relationships were observed between various running parameters and incident type 2 diabetes, supporting the prescription of running to prevent type 2 diabetes.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^111cuUry]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Training intensity targeting — benchmark peak attributes to set relative training load for individuals while recognizing limited evidence for injury-risk reduction. Based on benchmarking of maximal sprint velocity, maximal heart rate, intermittent running capacity, or other peak performance attributes, the relative training load can be evaluated for the individual player, which may offer a more precise understanding of demands and stress, although it is not consistently proven to be superior for alleviating injury risk or aligning with internal responses.

### Importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice: a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113rbkGs]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Field and clinic tests for estimating cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) describe running tests such as the maximal distance covered in 12 minutes or time to complete 1.5 miles, with a modification to reduce intensity being the 1-mile walk test whose regression equation included sex, age, body weight, and peak HR in the study population (343 people aged 30 to 69 years). In markedly deconditioned patients, the 6-minute walk test for distance (6MWT) is commonly used; however, it may not necessarily provide an accurate estimation of CRF, although in outpatients with stable coronary heart disease it provided a reasonable estimate of CRF and was similar to treadmill exercise capacity in predicting cardiovascular events over a median follow-up of 8.0 years. Conclusions emphasize that other performance tests, including submaximal exercise protocols and the 6MWT, can provide valuable information in clinical practice and should be considered when resources are limited, but these assessments are not as precise as peak or symptom-limited exercise testing in quantitating CRF.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^114fYb1o]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Marathon pacing relative to CS

It has long been appreciated that intensities corresponding to CS (or its cycling analogous critical power) can only be sustained for up to 1 h. In the present study, therefore, it was hypothesized that marathons would be performed at speed close to, but below, CS. The results showed that recreational athletes completed the marathon at ~85% CS (Fig. 2). Previous data on marathon performance relative to CS are limited to a small group of elite athletes, who were able to run the marathon at ~96% of their CS. It is not clear why elite athletes were able to sustain a higher fraction of their CS in the marathon. However, it has been recently shown that prolonged, submaximal exercise can affect both critical power and W′. Specifically, Clark et al. reported a ~10% reduction in critical power after 120 min of exercise below critical power. Assuming a similar decline in CS is also observed during prolonged exercise, CS may have been reduced during the marathon preventing participants to complete at a higher fraction of their CS. Clark et al. suggested that the decline in critical power may occur as a function of time, as it was evident after 120 min of exercise but not after 40 and 80 min of exercise. In the present study, we analyzed data from recreational runners with an average MT of ~230 min, which may result in greater a decline in CS compared with elite athletes who completed the marathon in ~125 min. In the present study, we observed that more competitive athletes were able to maintain speeds of up to 93.0% of their CS, but somewhat slower athletes were only able to complete the marathon at speeds corresponding to ~80% CS. Indeed, there was a strong negative relationship between MS relative to CS and finish time (R 2 ≥ 0.98; Fig. 3), which may be interpreted as (i) CS decreases as a function of time, and therefore faster athletes complete the marathon with a lower MT, which results in lower decrease in CS; (ii) faster athletes are fitter athletes, and fitness itself offers some protection to the deterioration of CS during exercise; or (iii) a combination of both. This remains speculative, and further research may investigate whether CS is also affected by prolonged running; its etiology and possible strategies to minimize such decline, including carbohydrate supplementation; and its implication for accuracy of MT predictions derived from CS and D′.

### Fast running does not contribute more to cumulative load than slow running [^116Fw2NM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

As running speed increases there are concomitant changes in loads associated with tibial stress fracture risk. Runners often include multiple speeds in their training, but the effect of speed distribution on load accumulation is unknown. We studied how running at different proportions of speed within a given running distance affects the cumulative loading of the vertical average loading rate, cumulative peak absolute tibial free moment, and cumulative peak axial tibial load. These loads were compared between two proportions of speed: running all distance at normal self-selected speed, and running the same distance at a combination of slow/fast speeds with the same average speed as normal. Also, the contributions of slow and fast running to the combined condition were compared.

Methods

Forty-three recreational runners (age, 18–49 yr; 29 female, 14 male) ran around a 50-m indoor track for three laps each at self-selected slow, normal, and fast speeds. Per-step peak loads and cumulative loads per kilometer were calculated at each speed and for each speed distribution, respectively.

Results

Only cumulative vertical average loading rate was lower at normal speed compared with the slow/fast speed combination. The contribution of fast speed running to cumulative tibial load was less than the contribution of slow speed running.

Conclusions

Running at a combination of slow and fast speeds, rather than a single moderate speed, increased cumulative vertical average loading rate but not cumulative tibial load or free moment. Fast running can be included in a training program without necessarily increasing the cumulative load. Total distance and average speed may not be sufficient information to estimate cumulative load from running training.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^115oU9iH]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Primary physiological predictors of athletic performance in cisgender men and women explain that endurance performance such as distance running (distances > 3000 m) is predicted by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), the maximal running intensity (or percentage of VO2max) that can be sustained during long time periods and is related to the critical velocity, and running economy. Faster distance running speeds of men compared with women are primarily explained by a larger VO2max of males with minimal differences in the relative maximal sustainable running intensity or running economy. In contrast, sports such as weightlifting and jumping performance are determined primarily by lean body mass and muscular power with large sex differences in both.

### How much is too much? (part 2) international olympic committee consensus statement on load in sport and risk of illness [^115pPvfF]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence relating sporting competition and risk of illness

As well as absolute and relative changes in training load, participating in single or multiple competitions (tournaments) also increases athletes' risk of illness. Competition load can refer to a single event (race, game) or multiple events over a period of time in different venues and of different durations. The earliest studies relating competition load and risk of illness were conducted among recreational runners participating in a single prolonged and strenuous ultramarathon event. These showed that URT illness symptoms were more frequent in the 1–2 weeks after the race compared with non-running controls. Postrace URT illness episodes were more frequent in faster runners, and in runners with a history of prerace URT illness symptoms. However, in shorter races (5, 10 and 21 km), postrace URT illness episodes were not related to prerace URT illness symptoms. These early data indicated that prerace URT illness symptoms, and increased race intensity and duration were associated with an increased risk of postrace URT illness symptoms.

Competition load and risk of illness has only been documented in a few sports other than distance running. In elite tennis players, increased matches per week were associated with increased risk of URT illness symptoms, while more frequent training and competition periods were associated with increased URT illness symptoms in American college football players. Recently, a number of prospective studies confirmed that both the precompetition and the competition period are associated with an increased risk of illness. In one study with a five-season follow-up of elite track and field athletes, 50% of all illness episodes occurred in the 2 months prior to major competitions. In another study, elite cross-country skiers participating in an 11-day ski tour had a higher incidence of illness compared with skiers not participating in the tournament. Finally, competition was an independent risk factor for illness (odds ratio for illness = 2.9) in a group of elite cross-country skiers that were followed over a 7–8 years period.

In summary, the current data indicate that participation in competitions (single or multiple) is associated with an increased risk of illness, but there are too few data to quantify that risk and this requires further investigation. The factors responsible for this increased risk as a result of competition are likely to be multifactorial and also need to be explored in future studies.

### Study protocol of a 52-week prospective running INjury study in gothenburg (SPRING) [^111sJaB9]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Running is one of the most popular forms of physical exercise among able-bodied individuals on a global scale. Millions of people across Europe run regularly, with proportions reported as 29% in Denmark, 25% in Germany, 19% in Belgium, 17% in Sweden, 14% in Finland and 12% in the Netherlands. Interestingly, the popularity of running has increased tremendously in the past decades, which is demonstrated in part by the growing amount of running eventsand increasing number of runners completing road races, such as 5 km, 10 km, half-marathon and marathon distances. The increase in popularity is in contrast to other sports, for example soccer and handball, which have been experiencing a decline in the proportion of athletes over the last few years. Running is characterised by its nature of simplicity, the opportunity to exercise whenever and wherever suitable and the relatively low cost. These characteristics makes running advantageous to other sports requiring fixed training days and more expensive equipment. Major reasons for running as a primary exercise modality include, but are not limited to, increased physical and/or psychological well-being, weight loss, self-development, performance enhancement and social interaction. From a health perspective, physical exercise, including running, offers substantial benefits, such as reduced risk of several metabolic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, pulmonary and neurological diseases compared with a sedentary behaviour. Consequently, the public health gains of keeping runners active should not be underestimated.

### The effect of training on running economy and performance in recreational athletes [^1171Mdax]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the effect of an 8-wk training program on the energy cost of running (C) and the performance of 16 recreational males.

Methods

A training group (TG, N = 8, 25.3 ± 2.9 yr, 183.6 ± 7.3 cm, 80.9 ± 9.6 kg) and a control group (CG, N = 8, 24.3 ± 3.7 yr, 179.3 ± 6.1 cm, 75.5 ± 8.0 kg) performed three two-stage tests (TST) at weeks 0, 4, and 8 (W0, W4, W8). Speeds of the first (v-slow) and second stage (v-fast) were 2.4 ± 0.3 vs 2.5 ± 0.4 m x s(-1) and 3.7 ± 0.3 vs 3.9 ± 0.4 m.s (TG vs CG), respectively. Maximum running time at v-fast (T) served as the measure of performance. C was calculated from oxygen uptake above rest, blood lactate concentration, and speed. The TG trained 3-5x wk(-1) at an HR of ± 10 beats of the HR measured at v-slow at W0 (161 ± 12 bpm). The CG did not train.

Results

At W0, there were no significant differences between the groups in T (377 ± 47 vs 335 ± 34 s) and C (v-slow: 4.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.3 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1); v-fast: 4.2 ± 0.4 vs 4.0 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)). In the CG, T and C remained almost unchanged at W4 (363 ± 38 s, 4.0 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)) and at W8 (342 ± 49 s, 4.0 ± 0.3 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)). In the TG, T increased (P < 0.05) at W4 (469 ± 45 s) and at W8 (591 ± 109 s). At v-fast, also C increased (P < 0.05) at W8 (4.6 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)), whereas at v-slow, C decreased (P < 0.05) at W4 (3.7 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)) with no further change at W8 (3.7 ± 0.4 J x kg(-1) x m(-1)).

Conclusion

The training successfully increased running performance in terms of T. During the initial training period, C could be reduced at the speed predominantly used in training. However, at high running speeds, C may even increase if the corresponding running time is largely increased.

### Running technique is an important component of running economy and performance [^115xR27p]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

Ten consecutive strides were analyzed from the 15 s of data captured at each velocity. The instants of touchdown and toe-off for each step were identified using an optimized algorithm method based on analysis of > 500 ground contacts on a force platform for various running speeds and footstrike patterns, which was an extension of previous methods. Initially, touchdown and toe-off windows were defined to limit the search regions: the touchdown window started when the anterior–posterior velocity of the heel marker changed from positive to negative and ended at the next minima in vertical heel position, and the toe-off window started 100 ms after touchdown and ended at the first of either the vertical toe position exceeding 0.1 m or reaching a maximum. Then within these windows, the instant of touchdown was defined by an algorithm identifying the first occurring peak of the vertical acceleration of the heel or first metatarsal head markers to account for all footstrike types. The toe-off algorithm used the time of peak vertical jerk (first derivative of acceleration) for the toe marker (positioned on the distal end of the hallux). In comparison with a force plate gold standard, this method resulted in touchdown, take-off, and GCT with mean offsets of +3.1, +2.1, and −1.1 ms, respectively, and root mean square errors for a single footstrike of 8.3, 5.6 and 9.0 ms, respectively.

On the basis of these events, the data were split into steps (e.g. right foot touchdown to left foot touchdown) and strides (e.g. right foot touchdown to right foot touchdown). Thereafter, kinematic variables were averaged across 10 strides, or 20 steps for each participant (i.e. both legs) at each running velocity up to and including their vLTP. Table 2 lists the 24 kinematic variables in five categories and their abbreviations. All length-dependent kinematic variables were normalized to standing height. The kinematic variables were then averaged across the three fastest common velocities (10, 11, and 12 km·h −1) in the same way as the LEc measurements. If a variable was not recorded for a runner at one of these speeds but values existed at adjacent speeds, the missing value was estimated by linear interpolation. If this was not possible then the runner was removed from the analysis of this variable.

### Changes in the energy cost of running during a 24-h treadmill exercise [^111uQfRa]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although fatigue generally increases the energy cost of running (Cr), the changes of Cr and associated variables during an ultramarathon are not known. This study aimed to determine the changes of metabolic and cardiovascular adjustments during an ultraendurance exercise.

Methods

Twelve healthy males ran 24 h on a motorized treadmill (24TR). Overall oxygen consumption (V˙O2 mL·min·kg), net energy cost (Cr J·kg·m), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were determined before, every 2 h, and after the 24TR at 8 km·h. Running speed and heart rate (HR) were continuously measured during the 24TR.

Results

V˙O2 increased (+7.6%, P < 0.001) during the 24TR, principally in the first 8 h of exercise. The RER mirrored changes in V˙O2, that is, decreased significantly until the eighth hour and remained constant thereafter. As a consequence of RER decrease, the increased Cr was markedly attenuated but was still significantly higher at the 8th and 12th hour compared with pre-24TR. Speed was constant over the first 6 h then significantly decreased during the 24TR. HR increased until the sixth hour (i.e. HR drift), then decreased until post-24TR. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (R = 0.75, P < 0.01) was observed between the velocity sustained during the 24TR (expressed in percentage of the velocity attained at V˙O2max: %VV˙O2max) and the pre- to postchanges in Cr.

Conclusions

The present study characterized accurately the changes of energy cost and substrate use during an extreme run, showing a plateau after 8 h of exercise. It is also concluded that the participants who maintained the highest %VV˙O2max were also those having most deteriorated their Cr over the 24TR, supporting the notion of a trade-off between running speed (relative to VV˙O2max) and Cr.

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^113YHtZp]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Therapeutic implications of physical activity (PA) and fitness indicate that low-fit individuals are approximately two to three times more likely to die during follow-up than their more fit counterparts. The absolute risk associated with each bout of exercise is relatively low and regular exercise, including high-volume endurance activity (> 1 h·d−1), reduces the long-term risk of acute cardiovascular events by up to 50%. Accordingly, a habitually sedentary lifestyle appears to be far riskier than a physically active one, and it is probably more important that individuals exercise regularly at a convenient time of day, regardless of the hour.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^112Ws7eh]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

New York City marathon — sex difference in first-place running velocity correlates with participation ratio, with a positive association between the ratio of men-to-women finishers and the sex difference in velocity (r = 0.58, r2 = 0.34, P < 0.001), a linear regression of y = 10.4 + 0.98x (n = 184 pairs), prediction that a ratio of 1 yields an 11.4% sex difference, and an averaged first-place sex difference of 16.9%; illustratively, a ratio of 6 means that for every female runner in a 10-yr age group, there were six male runners, and the dataset spans 31 yr.

### Youth running consensus statement: minimising risk of injury and illness in youth runners [^116VPdS5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the worldwide popularity of running as a sport for children, relatively little is known about its impact on injury and illness. Available studies have focused on adolescent athletes, but these findings may not be applicable to preadolescent and pubescent athletes. To date, there are no evidence or consensus-based guidelines identifying risk factors for injury and illness in youth runners, and current recommendations regarding suitable running distances for youth runners at different ages are opinion based. The International Committee Consensus Work Group convened to evaluate the current science, identify knowledge gaps, categorise risk factors for injury/illness and provide recommendations regarding training, nutrition and participation for youth runners.

### A 10% increase in step rate improves running kinematics and clinical outcomes in runners with patellofemoral pain at 4 weeks and 3 months [^116qeHq9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

One limitation of the present study is the lack of a control group, making it difficult to ascertain whether the observed findings are true intervention effects. However, participants in the present study had an average NRS pain score of 6.2 out of 10 at baseline and a minimum symptom duration of 3 months, which has been reported to be predictive of poor prognosis at long-term follow-up. Therefore, it is unlikely that participants would have experienced the magnitude of symptom improvement without a clinical intervention. Furthermore, the kinematic differences observed between baseline and the 4-week and 3-month time points were statistically significant, with large effect sizes above the standard error of measurement previously reported for these parameters. These differences were of a similar magnitude to those observed previously between injured and healthy runners (2.7°)and after gait retraining interventions (2.3°). Therefore, we believe that the differences observed represent true intervention effects and could be considered biomechanically important.

A second limitation is the small participant numbers, which makes the statistical interpretation of small differences difficult. We observed no significant kinematic changes between 4-week and 3-month follow-up. We acknowledge that the small sample size limited the statistical power to detect small differences between these time points. However, the magnitude of the differences in biomechanical outcomes between these 2 follow-up points was typically small (Table 2) and lower than the standard error of measurement previously reported for these parameters. Therefore, we believe that subtle differences between these time points are unlikely to be clinically important. However, we acknowledge that future randomized controlled trials with larger participant numbers are necessary to further validate our findings and confirm that kinematic changes are maintained over longer time periods.

It is important to note that 1 participant dropped out of the intervention after suffering a tibial stress fracture. This participant reported that the injury onset occurred after a sudden increase in training volume in preparation for a half-marathon. As we did not control participant progression of training volume, it is possible that the injury could be the result of training behaviors rather than a response to the intervention. As such, we recommend that future clinical interventions provide participants with specific advice on the safe progression of running volume to reduce the risk of further injuries.

### Physiological, perceptual, and performance responses to the 2-week block of high-versus low-intensity endurance training [^111AX4f1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Training Protocol

Both groups had five main sessions per week, which were supervised and performed individually at the same time of the day (± 2 h) during the morning or afternoon and at the same outdoor road/track, which was tight gravel (INT) or about 50/50 combination of gravel and asphalt (VOL). The INT group performed all the sessions as 6 × 3-min intervals, whereas the VOL group performed only low-intensity sessions below the first lactate threshold. If participants performed more than five sessions during the preparatory period, these sessions were also incorporated into the training period as low-intensity training with the same duration (INT) or with increased duration (VOL) to match the requirement of the volume increment. In case participants were accustomed to alternative endurance training modes such as cycling, these modes were incorporated as part of the additional sessions with similar proportion to the preparatory period.

Interval session

HIIT session was a 6 × 3-min interval with 2-min active recovery (walking). Intervals were performed at the maximal sustainable effort. Before the session, a 15-min warm-up, including three 30-s accelerations to the target speed, was performed. After the session, a 10-min cooldown was prescribed. Average running speed and HR were calculated separately for each interval and for the entire session, and a session RPE score was reported after each session.

Low-intensity sessions

The VOL group performed four similar basic sessions (85%–95% HR of the LT1) and one long-distance session (75%–90% HR of the LT1) in a week. The aim was to increase the duration of running sessions compared with preparatory period. The duration of these sessions was individually scaled based on the training during the preparatory period. The basic session was planned to be approximately 1.50× the average session duration during the preparatory period (1:22 ± 0:10 h:min), whereas the long-distance session was 1.66× the duration of the basic session (2:16 ± 0:16 h:min). Average running speed, average HR, and HR running speed index (HR-RS index) were calculated from all supervised sessions. In addition, session RPE was estimated after all sessions.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^112sUDaW]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Economy of motion in running, cycling, and swimming — individual variability and sex differences are noted, with running economy varying considerably between individuals (30%–40% in running and 20%–30% cycling) and improving with training for some athletes, yet running economy does not differ markedly between trained male and female runners. In recreational runners, females had a slightly lower gross oxygen cost at submaximal running velocities, and in swimming, females exhibit greater economy of movement than males, which may in part explain the narrowing of the sex difference in long‑distance pool events (> 400 m) and ultradistance open water swimming.

### Moving beyond weekly "Distance": optimizing quantification of training load in runners [^116qv4oS]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Quantifying total running distance is valuable, as it comprises some aspects of the mechanical/neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and perceptual/psychological loads that contribute to training stress and is partially predictive of distance-running success. However, running distance is only one aspect contributing to training stress.

Clinical Question

The purpose of this commentary is to highlight (1) problems with only using running distance to quantify running training and training stress, (2) the importance of alternative approaches to quantify and monitor training stress, (3) moderating factors (effect-measure modifiers) of training loads, and (4) the challenges of monitoring training stress to assess injury risks.

Key Results

Training stress is influenced by external (ie, application of mechanical load) and internal (ie, physiological/psychological effort) training load factors. In running, some commonly used external load factors include volume and pace, while physiological internal load factors include session rating of perceived exertion, heart rate, or blood lactate level. Running distance alone might vastly obscure the cumulative training stress on different training days and, ultimately, misrepresent overall training stress. With emerging and novel wearable technology that quantifies external load metrics beyond volume or pace, the future of training monitoring should have an ever-increasing emphasis on biomechanical external load metrics, coupled with internal (ie, physiological/psychological) load metrics.

Clinical Application

It may be difficult to change the running culture's obsession with weekly distance, but advanced and emerging methods to quantify running training discussed in this commentary will, with research confirmation, improve training monitoring and injury risk stratification.

### Ultramarathon is an outstanding model for the study of adaptive responses to extreme load and stress [^112MsVJY]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

While the industrialized world adopts a sedentary lifestyle, ultramarathon running races have become increasingly popular in the last few years, notably in the US, Europe, Japan, Korea, and South Africa. The ability to run long distances is also considered to have played a role in human evolution. This makes the issue of ultra-long distance physiology relevant. Ultramarathons are basically either performed on mostly flat roads or tracks, or run on varied terrain trails. They comprise races that are completed over the space of multiple days (for example, 6 days), with the winner being the one that covers the most distance within this set period of time or races that cover a specified distance during a single stage, which normally range from 50 km to 160.9 km or over several stages. The paper by Schütz et al. explores the physiological changes that occur in runners during this latter type of events, probably one of the most demanding physical exercise in humans, maybe only overpassed by polar expeditions (for example, Scott's party man-hauling their sleds across the Antarctic for 159 days in 1911/1912,) or other individual challenges such as the run around Europe in 2009/2010, that is, 27,012 km in 1 year (74 km/day), by the Frenchman Serge Girard. We recently reviewed the origin of muscle fatigue after prolonged exercises lasting from 30 minutes to several hours and found that the knee extensors isometric strength loss increased in a non-linear way with exercise duration, that is, there was a plateau after approximately 20 h of running. Recent findings from our group confirm this result for an even longer mountain ultramarathon (Tor des Geants, 330 km; unpublished results). These fatigue studies and other experiments conducted on inflammation, cardiovascular or renal consequences, endocrine/energetic aspects (see for example) help to understand acute consequences of an ultra-endurance exercise (generally shorter than 24 h, more rarely 2 or 6 days) but do allow examining recovery process, that is, tissue degeneration/regeneration over several days of extreme physical load.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^111BhRVC]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Determination of CS from raw training data

The conventional approach to determine CS and D′ requires a series of maximal efforts, either at constant intensity to task failure or as time trials. In the present study, we used raw training data to calculate CS and D′ and, therefore, did not have access to such information. Furthermore, we did not have access to physiological (e.g. heart rate) or psychobiological (e.g. rating of perceived exertion) data, which can be used as surrogate measures to evaluate whether a maximal effort has been performed. Instead we used the fastest pace recorded for six target distances, from 400 m to 5 km, during the weeks leading up to a marathon. This may impose a limitation on this study because using raw training data to calculate CS and D′ does not allow verification of maximal effort. We conducted some further analysis to develop an adjusted model in an effort to improve estimates of the fastest paces for runner, which form the basis of our model and estimates of CS and D′, in an effort to assess whether predictive trials were maximal. The adjusted model was developed with the assumption that when the fastest time for a target distance was recorded, the remaining of the activity should be considerably slower. The details of this adjustment are presented in the supplementary material accompanying this article (Supplemental Digital Content 2). In brief, as an example, if a runner ran their fastest 1 km over a 5-km session, but the remaining 4 km was not much slower, then it suggested that the fastest 1-km pace was not a maximal effort pace and, therefore, should be adjusted (i.e. increase pace). The adjusted model was complex, and the key results were similar to those obtained from the original analysis (see Appendix 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, Adjusted Model,) and, therefore, not included as part of the document. Further methodological considerations are discussed below. Nonetheless, the results presented herein suggest that raw training data have the potential to permit estimates of CS and D′ that are accurate and useful in practice. Further to its potential to assess endurance performance and inform pacing (see discussion below), CS may be seen as a tool to assess cardiorespiratory fitness because of its strong correlations with V˙O 2max, the time constant of V˙O 2 kinetics, the percentage of Type I muscle fibers, and muscle capillarity. Future studies may investigate whether raw training data can be used to assess improvement in fitness, by looking at the changes in CS and D′ with training.

Sex-specific risk during exertion — male versus female differences show that estimated death rates were five-fold higher in male athletes than in female athletes, the incidence of exertion-related SCD and AMI is lower in women than men, the risk of SCD during or immediately after exercise is 15-fold to 20-fold higher in men (vs a two-fold to five-fold higher male SCD rate in broader epidemiologic studies), and the rate of SCA during full and half marathon running is higher among men than women (0.90 vs 0.16 per 100, 000).

### Performance, return to competition, and reinjury after tommy John surgery in major league baseball pitchers: a review of 147 cases [^114BPYDw]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pitching performance metrics, durability, and reinjury after Tommy John surgery in professional baseball players have not been well described.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the likelihood of return to professional competition, reinjury rate, and change in performance after Tommy John surgery in Major League Baseball pitchers. The hypothesis was that performance metrics and durability will decline after surgery.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Publicly available records were accessed to generate a list of all Major League Baseball pitchers from 1999 to 2011 who had undergone ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction at any point in their careers; those with multiple reconstructive procedures were excluded. Return to active (≥ 1 game) or established (≥ 10 games) competition and/or placement on the disabled list was documented for each player. Among established players, pitching performance was compared pre- and postoperatively, as well as with age-matched control pitchers.

Results

Of 147 pitchers included, 80% returned to pitch in at least 1 Major League Baseball game. Only 67% of established pitchers returned to the same level of competition postoperatively, and 57% of established players returned to the disabled list because of injuries to the throwing arm. Finally, performance declined across several metrics after surgery compared with preinjury levels, such as earned run average, batting average against, walks plus hits per inning pitched, percentage of pitches thrown in the strike zone, innings pitched, percentage fastballs thrown, and average fastball velocity (P < .05 for all). However, these declines were not statistically different from similar declines found in age-matched controls who did not undergo Tommy John surgery.

Conclusion

Return to the disabled list after Tommy John surgery is common among professional pitchers (> 50%), and performance declines across several major metrics after surgery. Patients undergoing Tommy John surgery should be counseled appropriately regarding the likelihood of return to preinjury levels of competition and performance.

### Running 8000 M fast or slow: are there differences in energy cost and fat metabolism? [^112d3iwq]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare energy requirements and substrate use for running a given distance fast versus slow under field conditions.

Methods

Ten males and four females who were moderately endurance trained (32 ± 6 yr; 71 ± 11 kg; body mass index: 22.7 ± 2.3 kg x m(-2); VO2max: 62.0 ± 6.0 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1); individual anaerobic threshold [IAT]: 13.7 ± 1.4 km x h(-1)) performed an incremental running protocol to determine IAT. Subsequently, two 8000-m runs at 70 and 95% IAT were performed on separate days in randomized order on an indoor track. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured by means of a portable metabolic device (indirect calorimetry). A meaningful difference in EE was defined as > 10%.

Results

EE was significantly greater during the 95% IAT run than during the 70% IAT run (2650 ± 276 and 2554 ± 348 kJ, respectively). However, this difference was only 3.8 ± 4.8%. Including measurements up to 10 min postexercise, the difference rose to 5.1 ± 4.7% (95% IAT: 2830 ± 301 kJ; 70% IAT: 2692 ± 368 kJ). There was no significant difference between the absolute amounts of fat oxidized during the runs (70% IAT: 26 ± 5 g; 95% IAT: 20 ± 5 g). During the 95% IAT run, significantly more carbohydrates were metabolized than during the 70% IAT run (108 ± 14 and 90 ± 5 g, respectively). The difference in EE between the two runs increased from the first to the third part of the running distance (first: no significance; second: P < 0.01; third: P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Energy requirements for a commonly run distance in recreational endurance training differ significantly but not relevantly between slow and fast speeds. However, increasing total running distance might lead to larger differences.

### The promises and pitfalls of applying computational models to neurological and psychiatric disorders [^114Q9gyW]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

(ii) A new conceptualization

The original simple conceptualization of fitness (maximum distance covered at a given pace) captures some aspects of the athlete's ability but it only indirectly captures her race performance. In drawing together the biomechanical, biochemical and physiological levels in a mathematical model you find that a more useful conceptualization emerges, one that has much greater capacity to distinguish between runners. For example, her 'running economy' (amount of oxygen consumed per kg per min), may be more suitable for your purposes, offering both a predictive measure and one that you can focus on in improving her training.

(iii) Bridging the gaps

This new conceptualization, and the modelling process that generated it, provides a link across multiple levels of description of the act of running: the biomechanical, the neuromuscular, the biochemical and the physiological. All factors may play a part, both separately and through their interaction, in determining oxygen consumption per kg per min. Exploring its mathematically-defined relationships to changes at these many levels may offer new and powerful ways to understand, assess, and, ultimately, change running performance.

### Altered running economy directly translates to altered distance-running performance [^114FyivY]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our goal was to quantify if small (1%-3%) changes in running economy quantitatively affect distance-running performance. Based on the linear relationship between metabolic rate and running velocity and on earlier observations that added shoe mass increases metabolic rate by ~1% per 100 g per shoe, we hypothesized that adding 100 and 300 g per shoe would slow 3000-m time-trial performance by 1% and 3%, respectively.

Methods

Eighteen male sub-20-min 5-km runners completed treadmill testing, and three 3000-m time trials wearing control shoes and identical shoes with 100 and 300 g of discreetly added mass. We measured rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculated metabolic rates for the treadmill tests, and we recorded overall running time for the time trials.

Results

Adding mass to the shoes significantly increased metabolic rate at 3.5 m·s by 1.11% per 100 g per shoe (95% confidence interval = 0.88%-1.35%). While wearing the control shoes, participants ran the 3000-m time trial in 626.1 ± 55.6 s. Times averaged 0.65% ± 1.36% and 2.37% ± 2.09% slower for the +100-g and +300-g shoes, respectively (P < 0.001). On the basis of a linear fit of all the data, 3000-m time increased 0.78% per added 100 g per shoe (95% confidence interval = 0.52%-1.04%).

Conclusion

Adding shoe mass predictably degrades running economy and slows 3000-m time-trial performance proportionally. Our data demonstrate that laboratory-based running economy measurements can accurately predict changes in distance-running race performance due to shoe modifications.

### Why don't most runners get knee osteoarthritis? A case for per-unit-distance loads [^1122tVSC]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Peak knee joint contact forces ("loads") in running are much higher than they are in walking, where the peak load has been associated with the initiation and progression of knee osteoarthritis. However, runners do not have an especially high risk of osteoarthritis compared with nonrunners. This paradox suggests that running somehow blunts the effect of very high peak joint contact forces, perhaps to provide a load per unit distance (PUD) traveled that is relatively low.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare peak and PUD knee joint loads between human walking and running.

Methods

Fourteen healthy adults walked and ran at self-selected speeds. Ground reaction force and motion capture data were measured and combined with inverse dynamics and musculoskeletal modeling to estimate the peak knee joint loads, PUD knee joint loads, and the impulse of the knee joint contact force for each gait with a matched-pair (within-subject) design.

Results

The peak load was three times higher in running (8.02 vs 2.72 body weight, P < 0.001), but the PUD load did not differ between running and walking (0.80 vs 0.75 body weight per meter, P = 0.098). The impulse of the joint contact force was greater for running than for walking (1.30 vs 1.04 body weight per second, P < 0.001). The peak load increased with increasing running speed, whereas the PUD load decreased with increasing speed.

Conclusions

Compared with walking, the relatively short duration of ground contact and relatively long length of strides in running seem to blunt the effect of high peak joint loads, such that the PUD loads are no higher than that in walking. Waveform features other than or in addition to the peak value should be considered when studying joint loading and injuries.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^114kQRjP]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Critical speed (CS) represents the highest intensity at which a physiological steady state may be reached. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether estimations of CS obtained from raw training data can predict performance and pacing in marathons.

Methods

We investigated running activities logged into an online fitness platform by > 25,000 recreational athletes before big-city marathons. Each activity contained time, distance, and elevation every 100 m. We computed grade-adjusted pacing and the fastest pace recorded for a set of target distances (400, 800, 1000, 1500, 3000, and 5000 m). CS was determined as the slope of the distance-time relationship using all combinations of, at least, three target distances.

Results

The relationship between distance and time was linear, irrespective of the target distances used (pooled mean ± SD: R = 0.9999 ± 0.0001). The estimated values of CS from all models were not different (3.74 ± 0.08 m·s), and all models correlated with marathon performance (R = 0.672 ± 0.036, error = 8.01% ± 0.51%). CS from the model including 400, 800, and 5000 m best predicted performance (R = 0.695, error = 7.67%) and was used in further analysis. Runners completed the marathon at 84.8% ± 13.6% CS, with faster runners competing at speeds closer to CS (93.0% CS for 150 min marathon times vs 78.9% CS for 360 min marathon times). Runners who completed the first half of the marathon at > 94% of their CS, and particularly faster than CS, were more likely to slowdown by more than 25% in the second half of race.

Conclusion

This study suggests that estimations of CS from raw training data can successfully predict marathon performance and provide useful pacing information.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^114EL5YG]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

A linear regression between relative MS and MT was conducted to investigate how runners paced their marathon relative to their CS. Relative MS was determined as average speed during the marathon (i.e. MS) relative to CS (equation 3):

In addition, base speed (BS) was calculated as the average speed from the 2 km to the 16 km during the marathon, as we observed that during this early portion of the race most runners were able to sustain a relative stable pace. Relative BS was subsequently calculated as BS relative to CS (equation 4):

A linear regression was conducted to investigate the relationship between relative BS and relative MS. In addition, a linear regression was conducted between relative BS and frequency of runners that experienced a significant reduction in speed in the last section of the race, defined as a slowing down during the last 12.2 km of the marathon by more than 25% relative to their BS (i.e. slowdown > 1.25).

The athletes were categorized based on gender (male and female) and age, and all analyses were conducted for male and female runners and younger and older runners. For age, we selected an arbitrary threshold of 40 yr to distinguish between younger (< 40 yr old) and older (40+ yr old) runners, as this age resulted in approximately the same number of younger and older runners. The significance of the linear regressions was tested using F -tests, and we used one-tailed Welch's t -tests to assess the difference between groups (male vs female runners, younger vs older runners) for the variables above. We performed this analysis based on absolute MT, grouped in 10-min bins, and relative marathon performance (i.e. relative MS and relative BS), grouped in 2% bins. The SEE associated with CS and D′ was calculated and reported as coefficient of variation (CV%). All analyses were performed using Python. Results are presented as mean ± SD, unless otherwise stated. In all cases, a 99% confidence level (P < 0.01) was used as the threshold for significance.

### Physical preparation and return to sport of the football player with a tibia-fibula fracture: applying the 'control-chaos continuum' [^114oJXvE]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

High control: weeks 1–3 (20–23 weeks post-injury)

The high control phase aimed to establish a base for on-pitch preparation, and to progressively increase running volume (total distance). Running speeds were limited to 60%–65% of maximal speed to limit strain rate and magnitude of bone loading. Return to running sessions comprised of box-to-box runs; walking to the edge of the 6-yard box and back as active recovery (figure 3). This phase laid the foundation for running progression and built player confidence and trust in the rehabilitation process.

Quantitative evaluation

QNErequires the analysis of speed (divided into six progressively increasing speed categories) recorded in the last period of preinjury training versus the same parameters recorded in the postinjury period to make an RTP judgement.

For each of the six categories of speed listed, the recorded data should account for the time spent and distance covered at the indicated velocity. Recordings should be taken in similar training environments (ie, do not compare possession-based play with shuttle runs). The categories are presented below.

Walking (range 0– < 5.4 km/hour).
Jogging (range 5.5– < 10.8 km/hour).
Low speed running (range 10.9– < 14.4 km/hour).
Intermediate speed running (range 14.5– < 19.8 km/hour).
High-speed running (range 19.9– < 25.2 km/hour).
Maximum speed running (≥ 25.2 km/hour).

Qualitative evaluation

QLE is based on the analysis of metabolic power (MP) calculated with GPS technology. MP (expressed in W/kg −1) represents the product of speed and acceleration in determining the intensity of running.

The MP value can be calculated using the following formula:

where CE represents the energy cost of running at a constant speed (equal to 1 kcal/kg/km)and v is the athlete's instantaneous speed. Below is the division of MP into six progressively greater categories. MP is calculated by quantifying time spent in each MP category.

Low power (0– < 5 W.kg −1).
Intermediate power (5.1– < 10 W.kg −1).
High power (10.1– < 20 W.kg −1).
Higher power (20.1– < 25 W.kg −1).
Very high power (25.1– < 50 W.kg −1).
Maximum power (≥ 50 W.kg −1).

MP time values recorded in the last period of preinjury training are compared with the same parameters recorded postinjury to formulate the RTP judgement.

### Spontaneous pacing during overground hill running [^115whknM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate speed regulation during overground running on undulating terrain.

Methods

After an initial laboratory session to calculate physiological thresholds, eight experienced runners completed a spontaneously paced time trial over three laps of an outdoor course involving uphill, downhill, and level sections. A portable gas analyzer, global positioning system receiver, and activity monitor were used to collect physiological, speed, and stride frequency data.

Results

Participants ran 23% slower on uphills and 13.8% faster on downhills compared with level sections. Speeds on level sections were significantly different for 78.4 ± 7.0 s following an uphill and 23.6 ± 2.2 s following a downhill. Speed changes were primarily regulated by stride length, which was 20.5% shorter uphill and 16.2% longer downhill, whereas stride frequency was relatively stable. Oxygen consumption averaged 100.4% of runner's individual ventilatory thresholds on uphills, 78.9% on downhills, and 89.3% on level sections. Approximately 89% of group-level speed was predicted using a modified gradient factor. Individuals adopted distinct pacing strategies, both across laps and as a function of gradient.

Conclusions

Speed was best predicted using a weighted factor to account for prior and current gradients. Oxygen consumption (VO2) limited runner's speeds only on uphill sections and was maintained in line with individual ventilatory thresholds. Running speed showed larger individual variation on downhill sections, whereas speed on the level was systematically influenced by the preceding gradient. Runners who varied their pace more as a function of gradient showed a more consistent level of oxygen consumption. These results suggest that optimizing time on the level sections after hills offers the greatest potential to minimize overall time when running over undulating terrain.

### Running technique is an important component of running economy and performance [^11333wr7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

Participants performed an incremental running protocol, initially a discontinuous submaximal protocol that transitioned after vLTP into a continuous maximal protocol. Participants started at 8 km·h −1 (males) or 7 km·h −1 (females) with increments of 1 km·h −1, and the treadmill incline was 0%. The submaximal protocol consisted of 4 min of running at each speed, followed by 30 s rest during which time a capillary blood sample of ~30 μL was obtained from the fingertip for analysis of [La] b (YSI 2300; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). The submaximal protocol progressed until [La] b had risen by > 2 mmol·L −1 from the previous stage (or exceeded 4 mmol·L −1), when participants began a continuous treadmill test. In this continuous test, the treadmill speed increased by 1 km·h −1 every 2 min until volitional exhaustion. Respiratory gas data were recorded throughout the treadmill run, and motion capture data were recorded for 15 s starting ~30 s into each stage of submaximal running.

Data Analysis

Pulmonary gas exchange

Breath-by-breath V˙O 2 data were initially examined to exclude errant breaths (> 4 SD from the local mean) caused by coughing, swallowing, etc. Subsequently, the breath-by-breath data were converted to second-by-second data using linear interpolation. Oxygen consumption (V˙O 2), carbon dioxide production (V˙CO 2), ventilation rate (V˙ E), and RER were quantified for the final 60 s of each stage of submaximal running and for 30 s during the second minute of quiet standing. V˙O 2peak was determined as the highest 30 s moving average.

vLTP

vLTP was identified via a derivation of the modified Dmax method. Briefly, a fourth-order polynomial curve was fitted to the speed–lactate relationship. Lactate threshold was identified as the final stage preceding an increase in [La] b > 0.4 mmol·L −1 above the baseline level (lowest moving average of three values), and a straight line was drawn between the lactate threshold and the last 4-min stage of running (i.e. a rise of > 2 mmol·L −1 or exceeding 4 mmol·L −1). Finally, vLTP was defined as the greatest perpendicular distance between this straight line and the fourth-order polynomial to the nearest 0.5 km·h −1.

High-intensity interval training (HIT) and CRF — In healthy adults, HIT regimens have been shown to induce greater CRF increases than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) when total energy expended is similar; in a 6-week randomized study of 61 healthy adults, groups performed MICT (60 minutes, 4 days per week at 50% V̇O2R), vigorous training (40 minutes, 4 days per week at 75% V̇O2R), or near-maximal effort, with mean baseline CRF ≈10 METs and significant net peak/maximal V̇O2 increases of 3.4 ± 3.9 mL·kg−1·min−1 (9.4%), 4.8 ± 3.2 mL·kg−1·min−1 (13.7%), and 7.2 ± 4.3 mL·kg−1·min−1 (20.6%), respectively, versus 0.7 ± 3.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 (0.6%) in control.

### Study protocol of a 52-week prospective running INjury study in gothenburg (SPRING) [^113PrEaF]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Exposure

Exposure for H1–H4

The primary exposure is mACWR. mACWR is the ratio of AL and weighted chronic loads (WCLs). AL is calculated as the running distance (km) multiplied by the RPE for the present training session. Distance will be based on a self-reported number. RPE will be reported on a scale from 6 to 20.WCL is the weighted sum of each AL the previous 28 days. The weighting is exponential, as described by Williams et al, where the older training loads are given less weight than the more recent loads. The exponential time decay is given by 2/(N+1), where N is time difference in days from the present training day. The WCL is calculated in formula 1.

Thus, mACWR is calculated by:

Since the primary exposure is considered time-varying in nature, each runner has the possibility to transit between exposure states during the period of data gathering. The cut-off values to separate exposure states will be 0.8, 1.3 and 1.7.

Exposure for H5

For the explorative examination, we will use a 68% prediction limit for all continuous risk factors. Cut-off values will be ± 1 SD; all values inside of that range will be considered normal (similar level of measure), and all values outside of that range will be considered as outside of normal range.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^1172K7NQ]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Return to sport after sports-related concussion — a staged progression is outlined: symptom-limited activity with the objective of reintroduction of normal activities of daily living and that symptoms should not worsen with activity; light aerobic exercise with walking, stationary biking, and controlled activities that increase heart rate; sport-specific exercise such as running, skating, or other sport-specific aerobic exercise avoiding risk of head impact; noncontact training drills with sport-specific noncontact training drills that involve increased coordination and thinking and progressive introduction of resistance training; full-contact practice; and return to sport. RTS progressions should be individualized based on the injury, athlete's age, history, and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity and progressions may vary between athletes. Consider written clearance from a health care professional before RTS as directed by local laws and regulations.

### Time course of changes in endurance capacity: a 1-yr training study [^1174SL8z]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the magnitude and the time course of changes in endurance capacity during the first year of an aerobic endurance training program with constant HR prescription.

Methods

Eighteen previously untrained subjects (7 males and 11 females, 42 ± 5 yr, BMI of 24.3 ± 2.5 kg x m(-2), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) of 37.7 ± 4.6 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)) completed a 12-month jogging/walking program on 3 d x wk(-1) 45 min per session with a constant HR prescription of 60% HR reserve. Exhaustive treadmill tests were conducted before the intervention and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of training. In addition, submaximal tests on an indoor running track were performed every 4 wk.

Results

After 12 months, VO(2max) had increased by 0.36 ± 0.33 L x min(-1) (median [interquartile range]: 16% [9%-20%], P < 0.001). After 3, 6, and 9 months, 52%, 65%, and 79% of this increase were reached, respectively. Resting HR decreased by a total of 9 ± 6 min(-1) (P < 0.001). Of this change, 47% and 102% had occurred after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Submaximal exercise HR during the treadmill tests decreased by 11 ± 7 min(-1) (P < 0.001) on average. After 3 and 6 months of training, 93% and 101% of this change were observed, respectively. The running track tests revealed that submaximal exercise HR did not change significantly after the ninth week of training.

Conclusions

Beginners in recreational endurance exercise are advised to increase their training stimulus after 6 months of training to maintain training effectiveness because no further significant changes in endurance capacity were observed thereafter. When planning future endurance training studies in untrained subjects, it should be taken into account that submaximal exercise HR might reflect endurance changes during the first week only, whereas VO(2max) remains responsive after several months.

### Analysis of Hawaii ironman performances in elite triathletes from 1981 to 2007 [^114bJRtR]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the improvement in swimming (3.8 km), cycling (180 km), running (42.2 km), and overall performances at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon of elite males and females between 1981 and 2007.

Methods

Trends across years, gender differences in performance times in the three disciplines, and overall winning times of the top 10 males and females were analyzed.

Results

Overall performance time in the ironman decreased rapidly from 1981 but has remained stable since the late 1980s. From 1988 to 2007, linear regression analysis showed that change in swimming, cycling, running, and total performance for both males and females was less than 1.4% per decade, except for females' running time, which decreased by 3.8% per decade. Since 1988, the mean (SD) gender differences in time for swimming, cycling, running, and total event were 9.8% (2.9), 12.7% (2.0), 13.3% (3.1), and 12.6% (1.3), respectively.

Conclusions

After an initial phase of rapid improvement of performances during the 1980s, there was a relative plateau, but at least in running and cycling, there were small improvements. Over the last two decades, gender difference in swimming remained stable while it slightly increased in cycling and decreased in running. The gender difference in ironman total performance is unlikely to change in the future.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^1113AhHn]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Calculation of CS from raw training data

For each runner, the fastest time recorded at any time within the 16-wk period before the marathon was calculated for a range of target distances: 400, 800, 1000, 1500, 3000, and 5000 m. This range of target distances was selected because training programs may push runners to achieve fast times for these specific distances. Furthermore, athletes training for a marathon are likely to also participate in other races, such as 5000-m races, during their training, whereas the shorter distances are common in training programs with prescribed interval sessions or time trials. This range of distances is also similar to those used previously to determine CS in elite runners from performance data and from field studies.

Because the data were sampled at 100-m intervals, a rolling average of the grade-adjusted pacing was used to determine the fastest time recorded for each target distances and assumed to be T lim. For example, the fastest 1000-m performance was calculated as the rolling average of 10 consecutive values of the grade-adjusted pace that resulted in the shortest time. CS and D′ were then calculated for each athlete using the relationship between distance and T lim, where the slope of the line represents CS, and the y -intercept represents D′ (equation 2). For each athlete, 42 values of CS and D′ were calculated using all possible combinations that included, at least, three of the target distances: 400, 800, 1000, 1500, 3000, and 5000 m.

Statistical analysis

The ability of CS and D′ to predict marathon performance, defined as MT, was calculated using a linear regression. Specifically, we conducted 42 linear regressions, using all available values of CS and D′. However, for clarity, subsequent analyses were conducted only on the model using 400-, 800-, and 5000-m distances, which was selected as the best performing model (i.e. the model with the lowest SEE predicting MT). Briefly, to do this, we used each runner as the test runner and fit a linear regression model using the CS and D′ values of the remaining runners and their MT. Then, with the CS and D′ values of the test runner, we used the resulting linear regression model to predict the test runner's MT. This was repeated for all runners, and the percentage error between the actual and the predicted MT was used to compare the accuracy of predictions.

### Reliability of time to exhaustion analyzed with critical-power and log-log modeling [^11394yhc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The large variability of time to exhaustion between repeated tests at constant power output or speed gives an impression that these tests are unsuitable for monitoring athletic performance. We have addressed this issue using critical-power and log-log models of the speed-duration relationship to analyze treadmill runs.

Methods

Application of differential calculus to the models provided factors for converting variability in time to exhaustion into variability in equivalent time-trial time. We estimated values for the factors and variabilities from a reliability study. Eight male competitive runners performed a test consisting of three constant-speed runs to exhaustion lasting approximately 2, 4, and 8 min, with a 30-min rest between runs. A pair of such tests 5 d apart was repeated 7 and 14 wk later within a summer competitive season. We also used the models to predict times for fixed distances from each set of three runs. Repeated-measures analysis of log-transformed times provided estimates of variability expressed as coefficients of variation.

Results

Variabilities of time to exhaustion were 9.2, 13, and 16% (shortest to longest runs). Converted to their equivalents in time-trial time, the variabilities were 2.6, 1.7, and 1.0% via critical-power modeling, and 1.3, 1.7, and 2.2% via log-log modeling (90% likely limits x//1.2). The conversion factors varied typically by 28% (x//1.5) from runner to runner. Variabilities in times predicted for fixed distances were similar, but more uniform, for the log-log model.

Conclusion

Runs to exhaustion are inherently reliable, but conversion of changes in time to exhaustion at a single fixed speed into changes in equivalent time-trial time is model and individual specific, and therefore only approximate. Combining runs at several speeds with log-log modeling provides accurate conversion.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^112dCspy]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent shuttle run tests — Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery or Endurance tests, the 30–15 intermittent fitness test, and the aerobic multistage test — are described as options that generally prove capable of distinguishing between competitive levels in running-based intermittent sports, with performance links including Yo‑Yo IR1 correlations to total high‑intensity, very‑high‑intensity, and sprinting distance (r = 0.56 to 0.76) and Yo‑Yo IR2 linked with high‑intensity running performance in peak 5‑min periods (r = 0.72); significant correlations have also been observed between Yo‑Yo IR2 performance and skeletal muscle protein expression with parallel adaptations after high‑intensity training. For test selection, "this suggests choosing an intense intermittent test to evaluate the ability to perform high-intensity running in a condensed period including high demands on both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, whereas a more prolonged intermittent shuttle run test (e.g., the Yo-Yo IR1 or endurance tests) with a more distinct aerobic profile may be more relevant to evaluate the ability to sustain performance throughout a game and more closely linked with VO2max". For prescription, tests with fixed work‑bout duration such as the 30–15 "have been suggested to more closely resemble formal high-intensity running training formats and enable precise individual training prescription", and the 30–15 "employs a 40-m shuttle track compared with a shorter 20-m shuttle track in the Yo-Yo test packages", entailing more frequent turns and greater acceleration/deceleration time in the latter tests.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^116XmbHs]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Repeated sprint tests in intermittent sports — design and interpretation emphasize ecological task specificity, protocol parameters, and result handling. As more ecological valid options to test the ability to endure repeated maximal or near-maximal actions, these tests commonly consist of short ~2- to 10-s repeated all-out efforts interspersed by longer duration recovery (~10 to 60 s) and repeated a number of times (e.g., ~4 to 12 repetitions), with formats varying between straight-line, shuttle runs, and repeated change of direction tests and using active or passive recovery; test choice should be guided by the specific sport setting, with typical sprints in most intermittent sports occurring at < 5 s. Methodologically, too brief or too few repeated sprint efforts or too long interspacing recovery may be inadequate in inducing a degree of fatigue enabling a separation between athletes, and it is critical that athletes provide maximal efforts; the application of too many sprints may increase the susceptibility for pacing, so the initial repeated sprints should be conducted with a reference single sprint of the same duration. Interpretation is complicated by the strong interaction between the initial speed characteristics of a given athlete and the total or mean repeated sprint time obtained, irrespective of fatigue resistance, and, similarly, faster initial sprint performance increases the likelihood for an augmented drop in subsequent bouts; in this regard, total or mean repeated sprint time have been shown to be markedly more robust than fatigue decrement scores, and if fatigue decrement scores are to be adopted, the difference between the ideal repeated sprint performance and the actual total sprint performance has been suggested as the most reliable option, substituting for simplistic first-versus-last sprint comparisons that are associated with a large degree of variability.

### Exercising with reserve: exercise regulation by perceived exertion in relation to duration of exercise and knowledge of endpoint [^115wJhhD]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and performance during repetitive maximal effort 40 km time trials as well as after an intervention that aimed to decrease certainty about the remaining distance of the exercise bout. In addition, we examined the RPE during exercise bouts of markedly different duration.

Methods

Part 1: 12 well-trained, competitive-level cyclists completed five 40 km time trials. During the final time trial all feedback was withheld until the final kilometre. In addition, to cause confusion about the remaining distance, they were asked to report their RPE at random intervals from 18 km to 38 km. Part 2: 6 well-trained, recreation-level cyclists randomly completed a 5 km, 10 km, 40 km and 100 km time trial.

Results

Part 1: Mean RPE increased during the first four trials and decreased during the final trial. The rate of RPE progression increased in linearity during the first four trials and became more conservative in the final trial. These changes were directly related to performance. Part 2: Mean RPE for longer duration trials (40 km, 100 km) were lower during the first half of trial duration but matched those of shorter trials in the final 20%.

Conclusions

Increased familiarity of the exercise bout and certainty about its endpoint are associated with a more aggressive RPE strategy that produces a superior exercise performance. Certainty about the endpoint and the duration of exercise affect both the RPE strategy and performance.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^114iDsq8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Determination of CS and D′ from raw training data

The relationship between distance and duration was highly linear for all 42 combinations of target distances and T lim used (pooled average from all models and all participants: R 2 = 0.9999 ± 0.0001). The CS obtained from the 42 models was 3.74 ± 0.08 m·s −1, and the SEE associated with these estimates was 0.05 ± 0.02 m·s −1 (CV% = 1.3%). The corresponding value for D′ from the 42 models was 149 ± 24 m, and the SEE of these estimates was 28 ± 11 m (CV% = 19.44%).

The model using 400, 800, and 5000 m produced the lowest error to predict marathon performance and, therefore, was deemed as the best performing model. It resulted in a strong linear relationship between distance and T lim for all participants (R 2 = 0.999 ± 0.001), and the estimated mean values of CS and D′ for this model were 3.69 ± 0.57 m·s −1 and 136 ± 39 m, respectively. The corresponding CV% values associated with these estimations were 0.73% and 14.56%, respectively. For simplicity, all subsequent results refer to estimates of CS and D′ derived only from this best performing model.

The estimates of CS were ~16.4% greater for male runners compared with females (3.83 ± 0.54 vs 3.29 ± 0.47 m·s −1; t = 75.92, P < 0.01), whereas D′ estimates were ~7.8% lower for male runners compared with females (133 ± 37 vs 144 ± 41 m, respectively; t = −18.24, P < 0.01). With regard to age, estimates of CS for younger athletes were 8.8% higher than for older athletes (3.76 ± 0.59 vs 3.62 ± 0.54 m·s −1; t = 20.04, P < 0.01), whereas D′ was 1.6% greater in the younger compared with older age category (137 ± 38 m vs 135 ± 39 m; t = 4.57, P < 0.01).

### Bone turnover and metabolite responses to exercise in people with and without long-duration type 1 diabetes: a case-control study [^111ipGSv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide

Moderate-intensity exercise training has previously been demonstrated to alter resting P1NP concentration. Indeed, Adami et al found that P1NP increased after an exercise program of a month's duration in premenopausal women, which was associated with increased bone mineral density. In comparison, Maggio et al did not find a significant change in P1NP in children either with or without type 1 diabetes completing 9 months of two 90 min plyometric exercise sessions per week compared with non-exercising controls. This is despite the type 1 diabetes group having significantly lower resting concentration. In comparison, Elhabashy et al demonstrated that P1NP significantly increased by 40% after 3 months of three 60 min aerobic exercise per week in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. However, without a control group, it is unclear if this was a normal response. While both studies found increases in bone mineral density, differences in biochemical markers of bone turnover are likely due to differing populations and the frequency and type of exercise used. The acute P1NP response to exercise is less clear with Rantalainen et al, finding a non-significant increase in P1NP 24 hours, but not immediately, after a jumping exercise carried out to exhaustion. Hammond et al and Townsend et al found an immediate increase in P1NP post exercise in both fasted and fed states before a subsequent decline below baseline by an hour post 8×5 min running at 85% VO 2peak high-intensity interval running or running at 75% VO 2max until exhaustion. It is possible that our protocol was not strenuous enough to induce an increase in P1NP, or that we did not take measurements over a sufficient time period to detect such a rise. Nevertheless, Scott et al reported an acute increase in P1NP levels when healthy men ran at 55%, 65%, and 75% of VO 2max, but there was no effect of exercise intensity on P1NP response. It is possible the amount of mechanical strain, rather than exercise intensity, is key to inducing P1NP secretion. It would thus be interesting to repeat our study using a running protocol.

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^116HueGj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Exercise Program

The exercise programs consisted of a structured military mixed strength and endurance physical fitness training program, as well as occupational‐specific activities that were consistent for each participant. The fitness program incorporated strength‐based circuit training, run sessions (set distance middle distance runs, interval and farklet sessions), and swim sessions. Most sessions were 1 hour long. Occupational‐specific activities included graded endurance marches with graded load bearing (pack marching), obstacle courses, ropes courses, carrying heavy equipment/stretches, and combat drills. The full details of the exercise program are the property of the Army and cannot be documented in detail. The majority of the occupational‐specific activities were done as a group and were performed at the same pace within groups. The programs were set and run by qualified Army physical training instructors.

The exercise dose was controlled as were the frequency and type of exercise performed. The dose was controlled for as either the duration of exercise or the distance of an activity was kept constant between participants. Given the nature of the program and inherent individual variability, exercise intensity could not be completely controlled. However, all participants completed the same activities in a group environment with a physical training instructor giving set instructions to guide the level of intensity required (ie, number of repetitions) for circuits and level of intensity for farklet training (ie, 70% maximal speed). The dose and intensity of exercise gradually increased throughout both programs.

The intensity of each physical activity session was estimated by conversion to metabolic equivalents of task (METs) based on the 2011 Compendium of Physical Activity as a means to determine which activities in the program fell into the moderate‐ or high‐intensity category. Moderate‐intensity training was classified as physical training activities estimated to be between 4.3 and 6 METs, and high‐intensity activities were > 6 METs.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^112P8v6a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and fuel utilization — sex differences in endurance performance: Even when normalized to fat-free mass, sex differences in VO2max remain in the range of ~5%–10%. The fat oxidation advantage in females largely exists at low work rates (i.e., 41%–61% of VO2peak), whereas many elite athletic events are likely performed at a substantially higher VO2peak (≥ 85% VO2max) where fuel use is largely carbohydrate. Reported maxima show fat oxidation of ~7–8 kcal·min−1 versus carbohydrate oxidation at 85% of VO2peak of ~25 kcal·min−1, and even in ultramarathon events at lower VO2peak levels men outperform women at the elite level.

Study Design

Biomechanical cross-sectional study.

Objective

To investigate the hypothesis that the cumulative load at the knee during running increases as running speed decreases.

Background

The knee joint load per stride decreases as running speed decreases. However, by decreasing running speed, the number of strides per given distance is increased. Running a given distance at a slower speed may increase the cumulative load at the knee joint compared with running the same distance at a higher speed, hence increasing the risk of running-related injuries in the knee.

Methods

Kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected from 16 recreational runners, during steady-state running with a rearfoot strike pattern at 3 different speeds (mean ± SD): 8.02 ± 0.17 km/h, 11.79 ± 0.21 km/h, and 15.78 ± 0.22 km/h. The cumulative load (cumulative impulse) over a 1000-m distance was calculated at the knee joint on the basis of a standard 3-D inverse-dynamics approach.

Results

Based on a 1000-m running distance, the cumulative load at the knee was significantly higher at a slow running speed than at a high running speed (relative difference, 80%). The mean load per stride at the knee increased significantly across all biomechanical parameters, except impulse, following an increase in running speed.

Conclusion

Slow-speed running decreases knee joint loads per stride and increases the cumulative load at the knee joint for a given running distance compared to faster running. The primary reason for the increase in cumulative load at slower speeds is an increase in number of strides needed to cover the same distance.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112ngLeJ]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Physical activity and fitness outcome measures — Included measures comprise self-reported physical activity, preferences for physical activity and sedentary behaviors, electronic or mechanical monitoring of physical activity (e.g., via accelerometer, pedometer), minutes or percentage of time at different intensity levels of physical activity (e.g., vigorous, moderate, light, sedentary), direct observation and rating of physical activity (through in-person observation or recorded video), energy expenditure (e.g., via indirect calorimetry), cardiorespiratory fitness testing (treadmill exercise, endurance time, bicycle exercise ergometry, metabolic equivalents, distance runs/timed run, 20-meter shuttle test/Pacer, step-tests, resting heart rate), and sedentary time (e.g., screen time, TV time, computer time, video/DVD/movie time, video game time, phone time); studies measured these and other indicators of physical activity and did not limit outcomes because measurement varies widely across studies.

### Independent response modulation of visual cortical neurons by attentional and behavioral States [^115w9kWr]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

This equation was used for calculating the following two attentional modulation indices.

2) To assess how stable attentional modulation was within a block, a block was separated into halves such that each sparse noise stimulus had the same number of onsets. Spatial attention within the first and third blocks were assessed by using the equation (b). The mean responses in each half of the blocks were used as R in. To control for any time-dependent changes in sparse noise responses, the second blocks were also separated into halves, the first half was used as R out when calculating the indices for the two halves of the first blocks, and the second half was used for the two halves of the third blocks.

3) To assess how stable attentional modulation was between separate blocks within a session, we compared attentional modulation between the first and third blocks by using the equation (b). R in and R out were defined in the following way: R in for the first and third blocks were defined as the mean sparse noise responses during the second half of the first blocks and the first half of the third blocks, respectively; and to control for any time-dependent changes in visual responses, R out for the first and third blocks were defined as the mean sparse noise responses during the first and second half of the second blocks, respectively.

Running modulation index

A session was divided into running (running speed ≥ 1 cm/s) and stationary (running speed < 1 cm/s) epochs, and for each epoch the responses to all sparse noise stimuli within RFs were averaged after subtracting the median ΔF/F 0 signal during the baseline period. The ΔF/F 0 values around the peak (from 1 frame before the peak to 5 frames after the peak, corresponding to 0.5 s) were summed for running and stationary epochs separately to get R Run. and R Stat. respectively, and the running modulation index was calculated as follows:

The within-block and between-block reliability of running-dependent modulation was assessed by separating blocks in similar ways. The significance of running-dependent modulation was examined in the same way as attentional modulation.

### Running distance and biomechanical risk factors for plantar fasciitis: a 1-yr prospective 4HAIE cohort study [^112rJ2Wh]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

On the second day, participants carried out an overground running protocol at their self-selected speed. For runners, this was based on self-reported usual training running speed. Non-runners were asked to set the running speed at a pace that would allow them to run comfortably as far as possible. Subsequently, each participant ran at this pace for 2 min, and in the last 30 s, the speed of four unrecorded (by motion capture system) running trials was measured with photocells. The average of the four runs then indicated their self-selected preferred speed. Overground running consisted of eight successful trials on a 17-m-long runway at the participant's self-selected speed within ± 5% of the average speed from unrecorded trials. The running speed was always monitored by photo cells during the data collection. The starting position for running trials was always set at least 7 m from the force plate. A successful running trial was considered when participant landed on the force plate with the entire right foot (approximately in the middle of the force plate) and running speed fall within ± 5% of the average speed from previously determined self-selected running speed.

Anthropometric data (body height and mass) of all participants were measured by a stadiometer (In Body 370; BioSpace, Seoul, South Korea) and body composition analyzer (Inbody 770; BioSpace, Seoul, South Korea), respectively. Body composition parameters of fat and fat-free mass (lean mass) were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Hologic Discovery A, Waltham, MA).

Behavioral data analysis

Reaction time Reaction time was calculated as the duration from the digital output signal triggered at the onset of go stimulus to the first lick after the onset. We excluded the following trials from analysis: 1) trials in which the lick sensor was triggered within 200 ms before the onset of go stimulus because mice often kept hitting the spout with forepaws in most of such trials, and 2) trials in which reaction time was too short (cut-off under ~160 ms). The reaction times of Miss trials were set to 1.6 s when calculating the mean reaction time.

Performance

Task performance was quantified with the behavioral d-prime as described previously. Briefly, it is the difference between normal inverse cumulative distribution function of Hit rate and that of False alarm rate (FA rate).

When the Hit rate was 100% (i.e. no misses occurred), it was given as:

Pupil size and position

Movies from the eye cameras were processed with the Matlab VideoReader function. After cropping the region around the eye, the pupil was defined by k-means clustering and an ellipse was fitted on the resulting binary images by using a Matlab function fitellipse.m. The area, position, and angle of pupil were calculated from the fitted ellipses. The deviations of the pupil position relative to its median position during the sparse noise period were calculated as angles in degrees for both azimuth and elevation. Video frames in which mice were not staring at the monitor (e.g. eye closure and grooming events) were identified as those whose 2-D correlation coefficient with the average image was smaller than the median correlation coefficient by more than 5.5 standard deviation and corresponding two-photon imaging frames were excluded from analysis.

Running speed

Running speed was calculated by converting the rotary encoder signal and filtered over 500 ms by the Savitzky-Golay filtering.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^113H79RU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Resistance/strength training in chronic respiratory disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) — local muscle groups are trained by relatively heavy loads, and resistance training may assist with maintaining or improving bone mineral density, which has been shown to be abnormally low in about 50% of individuals with COPD; for adults, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions on 2 to 3 days each week with initial loads equivalent to either 60 to 70% of the one repetition maximum, progressing when an individual can perform the current workload for 1 or 2 repetitions over the desired number of 6 to 12 on 2 consecutive training sessions by modulating prescriptive variables such as increasing the resistance or weight, repetitions per set, number of sets, and/or decreasing rest; studies using loads equal to or exceeding 80% of one repetition maximum have reported improvements in submaximal exercise capacity, peak power via cycle ergometry, and peak walk speed measured over a 30-m track, whereas in some but not all studies training loads between 50 and 80% of one repetition maximum were sufficient to improve endurance exercise capacity and programs using more modest loads were ineffective; resistance exercise elicits a reduced cardiorespiratory response compared with endurance exercise, demanding a lower level of oxygen consumption and minute ventilation and evoking less dyspnea; in combination, constant-load/interval and strength training improves outcomes to a greater degree than either strategy alone without unduly increasing training time.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112jC966]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury rehabilitation — exercise initiation and dosing: Evidence supports initiating hamstring-strengthening exercises, including eccentrics, early in the rehabilitation process, guided by patient pain tolerance, with successful interventions included 6 to 12 repetitions, depending on the intensity of the exercise, with both load and ROM increased as tolerated; patients should perform the exercises 2 to 3 times per week. Evidence also supports progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and a running program involving acceleration and deceleration phases, with a progressive increase in speed and distance, throughout the rehabilitation process as tolerated, and the benefits of eccentric training, added to stretching, strengthening, stabilization, and progressive running programs, are improved RTP times and reduced reinjury rates, while potential harms include a potential to aggravate symptoms and load the activity that was causative.

### A neural circuit arbitrates between persistence and withdrawal in hungry drosophila [^111XJA43]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Behavioral analysis

Statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad 7, and Python 2.7 with Pyvttbl (0.5.2.2) and Scipy.stats (0.14) packages. All results of the statistical analysis can be found in Table S1. Outliers were removed from all calculations with ROUT (Graphpad, Q = 5%) analysis. Average speeds and run times, as described in the 'Spherical Treadmill behavioral assay' section above, were calculated for the indicated time windows (pre, stim, post). Baseline running speeds were analyzed before initial odor stimulation (see Table S1). Average run speeds show fly performance from odor onset until odor termination per trial or over all trials as indicated.

In Figures 1 B and 1C, wild-type CS data were analyzed under different time windows (before, during and after odor exposure) for run and turn speeds with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons as a post hoc test. To further inspect how run speeds over ten trials changed for the same dataset, the run speeds during the odor stimulation phase in the later trials were compared to the first trial in Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, after one-way ANOVA test (Figure 1 E). During the closed-loop analyses, average run times did not conform normality. Therefore, total run times were calculated for individual flies and used in subsequent statistical analysis. Total run times, and run speeds were compared with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple post hoc comparisons (Figures 1 M and 1N).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^116Ki66u]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Treadmill and cycle ergometer exercise testing — pulmonary rehabilitation responsiveness and minimal important difference (MID) metrics are reported as follows: incremental treadmill protocols show an improvement in peak aerobic capacity of 0.1 to 0.2 L/min (approximately 10–20% of baseline) and constant speed treadmill walking yields a greater than 80% increase from baseline endurance time, but the MID has not been well established for incremental or endurance treadmill tests. For incremental cycle ergometry, average changes include an 8- to 12-W increase in peak work load and a 10–20% improvement in peak aerobic capacity, with the MID suggested as a 4-W increase in peak work load. For endurance constant-load cycle tests, usually conducted at 70–85% of baseline peak work load or peak aerobic capacity, endurance time improves by more than 80% from baseline and the proposed MID is in the range of 100–105 seconds. Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation is commonly assessed using a walking protocol, and when assessing efficacy, endurance tests are more responsive, although the incremental test is an essential and necessary prelude to setting constant loads.

Endurance and open-water swimming — contextual exceptions and example performance show that men outperform women at the elite level in running events, women have outperformed men only in ultradistance open water swimming when water temperatures are cold (< 20°C) and distances are greater than 30 km, whereas in long-distance open water swimming less than 30 km the best men typically outperform the best women; for example, the first-placed man was 10.4% faster than the first-placed woman in the open water 10-km event at the 2022 World Championship in Budapest, Hungary (sea race).

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^111ziREq]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Methodological considerations

The determination of CS and D′ requires participants to perform a series of maximal efforts. When testing is conducted in a laboratory, it is possible to assess if participants have performed a maximal effort, for instance, by checking whether V˙O 2max has been attained during predictive tests. In the current study, however, CS and D′ have been determined using raw training data, and it was not possible to verify whether predictive tests represented a maximal effort. Although this is a potential limitation for using raw training data to calculate CS and D′, it is worth noting that (i) when performing maximal efforts, the relationship between distance and time becomes linear. The data reported herein also show a very strong linear relationship between distance and time for all participants. (ii) We used data from a 16-wk period before the race and only included runners with at least 24 activities logged during this period. It is plausible that some of the activities in the data set correspond to shorter races (e.g. 5 km) and training activities performed maximally, e.g. high-intensity interval training. (iii) It has been shown that unintended efforts over a single training session can be used to estimate critical power and W ′, and such estimations are similar to those obtained from field data do not have to perform predefined intentional efforts. However, Karsten et al. included race data, whereas it was not possible to differentiate training or race data in the current study. (iv) CS and D′ were determined using an adjusted model, with the assumption that if runs included in the analysis of CS and D′ would approximate a maximal effort, these would be likely to occur early in a training session. The results from the adjusted model (presented in the Supplemental Digital Content) were similar to those presented herein. Therefore, although a degree of caution is warranted until a direct validation of CS and D′ determined from raw training data is performed against laboratory-based estimations of these parameters, the results suggest that it would be possible to calculate CS and D′ from raw training data and such estimates can be useful to estimate marathon performance and inform pacing.

### Process-and product-oriented fundamental movement skills in early childhood as predictors of later health-related fitness [^112RdPvX]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness

CRF was assessed using the 20-m shuttle run test, as described by Léger and Lambert. This test is a recognized and reliable method for evaluating the CRF of children. It begins with a beep signal, prompting children to run 20 m until they hear the next beep, signaling the start of a new lap. The initial running speed was set at 8.5 km/h and increased by approximately 0.5 km/h every minute. The test result was determined by the total number of laps completed in sync with the beep signals.

Muscular fitness

In this study, MF was evaluated using curl-ups and push-ups. Curl-ups, which assess the endurance of abdominal muscles, are known to have acceptable measurement properties. Participants began the curl-ups lying down, with their heads, straight arms, and soles of the feet touching the mat and with knees bent at 100 degrees. Fingertips were placed at one edge of a marked 8-cm wide tape. During the exercise, participants started in a supine position and raised their upper bodies from the mat until their fingertips touched the opposite edge of the tape. This motion ensured engagement of their abdominal muscles, while their heads returned to the starting position on the mat after each repetition. The test involved performing as many correctly executed curl-ups as possible, synchronized with an audio tape, with the maximum score of 75 repetitions.

The push-up test, a reliable measure of upper-body muscle strength for children, was also used. In the push-up test, boys started with their weight on their toes and girls on their knees, both with straight arms positioned next to the shoulders and fingers pointing forward. The body remained straight, and the face was positioned downward. From this starting position, participants lowered themselves until their upper arms were horizontal and then pushed up to full arm extension, returning to the starting position to complete one push-up. The result was based on the number of correctly performed push-ups within 60 s.

### Using models to predict the future: what to do when the data run out? [^112yDrXN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Although clinical trials often provide "best evidence" comparing the effectiveness of alternative management strategies, such evidence can be limited in duration or in the results reported, causing clinicians and policy analysts to wonder "what if?" Models of the clinical prognosis-often spanning patients' lifetimes (the "long haul")-are perhaps weaker evidence, but can help answer questions about the management of individual patients and place that best evidence into the context of clinical reality.
