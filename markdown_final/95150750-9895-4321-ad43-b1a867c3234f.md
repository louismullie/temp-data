## Question

Management for suspected rejection after liver transplant 6 weeks post op

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management plan for suspected rejection 6 weeks after liver transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical suspicion and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, especially the necessity and timing of liver biopsy. Next, I will classify rejection histologically and by mechanism. After that, I need to tailor treatment by severity and phenotype, including infection prophylaxis and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I should plan monitoring, reassessment, and escalation strategies, and consider special scenarios like HCV recurrence and pregnancy, while double-checking that each step aligns with current AASLD/AST guidance and evidence strength [^116K2mpn] [^114U8rP8].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and competing diagnoses at 6 weeks post-transplant, because I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions about rejection when vascular, biliary, infectious, or drug-induced causes are common in this window. Early allograft dysfunction, hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, biliary strictures or leaks, CMV or HCV infection, and DILI can all mimic rejection, so I should verify these possibilities with targeted imaging and labs before labeling this as rejection [^112xHeNE] [^1132Wcrc] [^114N38DP] [^111tbAtp].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate diagnostic steps before biopsy. I should obtain a comprehensive liver panel, renal function, and a complete blood count, and I will now examine the need for Doppler ultrasound of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic veins, with MRCP or ERCP if cholestasis or biliary dilation is suspected, because missing a vascular or biliary complication would misdirect therapy and delay definitive management [^1132Wcrc] [^112YGY7R].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of noninvasive biomarkers before proceeding to biopsy. Peripheral blood biomarkers, including donor-derived cell-free DNA and immune function assays, are promising but not validated to diagnose or exclude TCMR, so I should not rely on them to make a treatment decision; they may inform immunologic risk, but histology remains the gold standard here [^116FhHet] [^117UPHVw] [^113gLgDq].

> I need to ensure I do not treat empirically without histologic confirmation. The AASLD/AST guideline is explicit that rejection can be reliably diagnosed only on liver histology, and a biopsy should be obtained before initiating antirejection therapy, with classification by Banff criteria; pretreatment blunts portal inflammation and endothelialitis, which can obscure the diagnosis and underestimate severity, so I should double-check that we biopsy first whenever feasible [^1152Lnkb] [^112154mz] [^1151kzh7].

> Next, I should review what the biopsy must include to avoid missing key phenotypes. I need to confirm that the pathology request specifies Banff grading for TCMR, evaluation for plasma cell–rich rejection, and C4d staining with assessment for endothelialitis and capillaritis to evaluate for AMR, along with donor-specific antibody testing when AMR is suspected, because missing AMR or PCRR will alter management and prognosis [^112eTDwB] [^1171E1V3] [^111xvWhu].

> Let me think about histologic classification and how it guides therapy. Mild TCMR with RAI less than 4 often responds to augmentation of maintenance immunosuppression, whereas moderate to severe TCMR with RAI 4 or higher warrants high-dose IV corticosteroids with a taper and optimization of baseline immunosuppression; I should double-check that I am aligning the Banff severity with the treatment intensity to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment [^112eTDwB] [^113cRb7y].

> I will now examine the treatment of mild early TCMR. Augmentation should prioritize optimizing tacrolimus to target troughs of about 7–10 ng/mL in the first month, switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus if applicable, and adding a second class such as mycophenolate or an mTOR inhibitor if monotherapy is insufficient; I should confirm that these adjustments are made with close monitoring of drug levels and renal function [^1155pmSi] [^112XQpB5] [^112eTDwB].

> For moderate to severe TCMR, I should confirm the steroid protocol. High-dose IV methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg daily for 1–3 days followed by a prednisone taper starting around 40–80 mg daily with 10–20 mg decrements is standard, with concurrent infection prophylaxis during high-dose steroids; I need to ensure CMV prophylaxis is resumed or extended if anti-lymphocyte therapy is used, and I should verify that lymphocyte-depleting agents are generally avoided for routine rejection unless refractory [^113cRb7y] [^113AXnvn] [^114ib8Vi].

> But wait, what if the rejection is antibody-mediated rather than T cell–mediated. If AMR is suspected by clinical context, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positive DSA with supportive histology and C4d staining, I should treat with high-dose corticosteroids plus augmentation of immunosuppression, and if there is no improvement, escalate to plasmapheresis and IVIG with or without anti-CD20 therapy; I should double-check that DSA testing is reserved for severe or steroid-resistant rejection or unexplained dysfunction to avoid overdiagnosis [^1171E1V3] [^116foP9z] [^111xvWhu].

> Let me consider plasma cell–rich rejection, which can masquerade as de novo AIH. I should confirm that PCRR is treated with corticosteroids and augmentation of existing immunosuppression, and I need to ensure that the pathology team is aware of the clinical suspicion to appropriately interpret the plasma cell–rich pattern and central perivenulitis on biopsy [^114okYDW] [^112ovVtn].

> I should double-check maintenance immunosuppression targets after treating rejection. Tacrolimus troughs are generally maintained at 7–10 ng/mL in the first month, 4–8 ng/mL in months 2–12, and around 4 ng/mL thereafter, with adjustments based on rejection history, renal function, and adverse effects; if CNI minimization is needed, adding mycophenolate or an mTOR inhibitor can preserve efficacy while reducing nephrotoxicity [^1155pmSi] [^115F5inw].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment to ensure response. Liver tests should be checked frequently, typically every 1–3 days during active treatment, then weekly as stability returns; if there is inadequate biochemical response within about 5–7 days after completing steroids, I should verify the diagnosis with repeat biopsy to assess for ongoing TCMR, evolving ductopenic rejection, or an alternative diagnosis, and I should remember that pretreatment can attenuate portal inflammation and endothelialitis, making bile duct injury a clue to partially treated rejection [^116K2mpn] [^1151kzh7].

> Hold on, I should verify infection prophylaxis and drug–drug interaction risks during intensified immunosuppression. CMV prophylaxis is indicated for high-risk serostatus and should be resumed or extended when anti-lymphocyte therapy is used, and I need to check for interactions between antimicrobials and CNIs or mTOR inhibitors to avoid supratherapeutic immunosuppression or toxicity [^113AXnvn] [^114N38DP].

> I need to ensure I have a clear escalation pathway for steroid-resistant rejection. If there is no histologic or biochemical improvement after an adequate steroid course, options include a second steroid pulse, addition of mycophenolate or an mTOR inhibitor if not already used, and in refractory TCMR, lymphocyte-depleting therapy such as antithymocyte globulin may be considered despite infection risks; for refractory AMR, plasmapheresis, IVIG, and anti-CD20 therapy are reasonable next steps [^116TBYaw] [^111RKYuY].

> Let me reconsider special contexts that can confound the picture at 6 weeks. HCV recurrence can mimic rejection and vice versa, so if the recipient is HCV-positive, I should confirm histology and consider early antiviral therapy for significant recurrent disease; conversely, interferon-based regimens historically increased rejection risk, reinforcing the need for biopsy-directed diagnosis and careful immunosuppression management in that era, though current DAA regimens have improved safety profiles [^111PeaeR] [^115UoSN2].

> I should confirm that pregnancy, if applicable, does not alter rejection management principles. Allograft dysfunction during pregnancy warrants appropriate investigation, including liver biopsy when indicated, and rejection is treated similarly to nonpregnant patients, with tacrolimus monotherapy generally preferred and levels monitored frequently due to pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy [^113pxR3P] [^117FYLcq].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal planning once rejection is controlled. Immunosuppression should be reviewed at least every 6 months to balance efficacy and toxicity, and complete withdrawal is not routinely recommended outside of highly selected, closely monitored recipients; protocol biopsies are not recommended for stable patients, but any new biochemical instability should prompt timely biopsy and targeted evaluation [^111bfxW8] [^1169nNrk] [^112ndwk2].

For suspected rejection 6 weeks after liver transplant, **confirm with biopsy before treatment** [^1152Lnkb] and classify severity using Banff criteria [^112eTDwB]. Mild rejection is managed by **optimizing tacrolimus and adding mycophenolate** [^notfound]; moderate-to-severe rejection requires **high-dose IV corticosteroids with a taper** [^113cRb7y] and augmentation of maintenance immunosuppression [^116K2mpn]. If rejection is steroid-resistant, escalate to antithymocyte globulin or plasmapheresis/IVIG [^116TBYaw] [^111RKYuY]; for chronic ductopenic rejection, consider retransplantation [^1151ENNg]. Throughout, monitor for infections and drug interactions, and adjust immunosuppression to balance efficacy and toxicity [^114N38DP] [^111mmAPT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a thorough **history and physical examination** to identify symptoms and signs of rejection, such as fever, malaise, abdominal pain, jaundice, and altered mental status [^112xHeNE]. Laboratory tests should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), bilirubin, INR, and a complete blood count [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging studies should begin with **Doppler ultrasound** to assess hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein patency and to exclude vascular complications [^1132Wcrc]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or if biliary complications are suspected, proceed to MRI or CT [^112YGY7R].

---

### Histopathological confirmation

Histopathological confirmation requires a **liver biopsy**, as rejection can only be reliably diagnosed histologically [^1152Lnkb]; classify severity using Banff criteria [^112eTDwB]. Mild rejection is defined by a rejection activity index (RAI) < 4, moderate by RAI 4–6, and severe by RAI > 6 [^notfound].

---

## Immunosuppressive management

### Mild acute cellular rejection (ACR)

- **Optimize tacrolimus**: Target trough levels 7–10 ng/mL in the first month, 4–8 ng/mL thereafter [^1155pmSi].

- **Add mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)**: 1–1.5 g twice daily if not already included [^notfound].

- **Monitor response**: Adjust immunosuppression based on clinical and laboratory response [^116HPhtB].

---

### Moderate-to-severe ACR

- **High-dose intravenous corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg IV daily for 1–3 days, followed by a prednisone taper (40–80 mg daily, taper by 10–20 mg decrements) [^116K2mpn].

- **Augment maintenance immunosuppression**: Optimize tacrolimus, add MMF or mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus or everolimus) if needed [^113cRb7y].

- **Monitor for infections**: Provide prophylaxis against CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and fungal infections during high-dose immunosuppression [^113AXnvn].

---

### Steroid-resistant rejection

For steroid-resistant rejection, **antithymocyte globulin (ATG)** is indicated for refractory T-cell mediated rejection [^116TBYaw]. Alternatively, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used, with or without rituximab, particularly for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) [^116foP9z].

---

## Management of chronic rejection

Chronic rejection, or chronic ductopenic rejection, requires **early immunosuppression augmentation** — switching cyclosporine to tacrolimus and adding MMF or an mTOR inhibitor [^1151ENNg]. For progressive chronic rejection despite optimal immunosuppression, consider retransplantation [^1151ENNg].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **frequent liver function tests** and immunosuppressive drug level monitoring to guide dosing adjustments [^116HPhtB]. Regular clinical assessments should evaluate for signs of rejection, infection, and drug toxicity [^114N38DP]. Patient education should emphasize adherence to immunosuppressive regimens and recognition of rejection symptoms [^113ySmym].

---

## Complications and side effects

Complications and side effects include an **increased infection risk** — particularly CMV, bacterial, and fungal infections — during intensified immunosuppression [^114N38DP]. Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are associated with calcineurin inhibitors; monitor renal function and neurologic status [^115F5inw]. Metabolic complications — hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes — require ongoing management [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally favorable, as most rejection episodes resolve with appropriate immunosuppression, and **graft survival remains high** [^116K2mpn]. However, recurrent or chronic rejection increases the risk of graft loss and may necessitate retransplantation [^1151ENNg].

## Management of suspected rejection 6 weeks post-liver transplant

| **Severity** | **Treatment** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Optimize tacrolimus; add MMF | Frequent LFTs; drug levels |
| Moderate-severe | High-dose IV steroids; taper; augment immunosuppression | Frequent LFTs; infection prophylaxis |
| Steroid-resistant | ATG; plasmapheresis; IVIG | Frequent LFTs; infection prophylaxis |
| Chronic | Switch to tacrolimus; add MMF or mTOR inhibitor | Frequent LFTs; consider retransplantation |

---

Management of suspected rejection 6 weeks after liver transplant centers on **histologic confirmation** and **severity-based immunosuppression**, with close monitoring for infections and complications. Most cases resolve with optimized therapy, but refractory rejection may require advanced interventions or retransplantation [^116K2mpn].

AASLD and AST practice guideline — Immunosuppression management and rejection diagnosis after liver transplantation includes the following recommendations. Immunosuppressive drugs for LT recipients should be prescribed and monitored only by those with knowledge and expertise in that area. The choice of agents will depend on many factors, and no one regimen can be recommended for any patient (grade 2, level A). Every patient's immunosuppressive regimen should be reviewed at least every 6 months and modified as required with the goal of minimizing long-term toxicities (grade 1, level B). Rejection can be reliably diagnosed only on the basis of liver histology; a biopsy sample should be taken before treatment initiation and classified according to the Banff criteria (grade 1, level A). Although the long-term withdrawal of all immunosuppression can be achieved in a small number of patients, this should be undertaken only with select recipients and under close supervision (grade 2, level C).

Adult liver transplant long-term management — Recommendation 8 states that rejection can be reliably diagnosed only on the basis of liver histology; a biopsy sample should be taken before treatment initiation and classified according to the Banff criteria (grade 1, level A). Late rejection is defined as rejection that has its onset more than 90 days after transplantation, and traditionally, 2 forms have been recognized: cellular rejection (also known as acute cellular rejection and late-onset rejection) and ductopenic rejection (also known as vanishing bile duct syndrome). Both forms of rejection are, until the late stages, asymptomatic, diagnosis is made through the investigation of abnormal liver tests, and the diagnosis can be confirmed only on the basis of histology.

AASLD AST practice guideline — T-cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) after adult liver transplantation is characterized and managed as follows: Acute TCMR occurs in 10%-30% of recipients, usually within the first three months, whereas late TCMR is defined as occurring six months after transplantation, with some defining it as 3–12 months post-LT. Initial treatment of mild acute TCMR (rejection activity index < 4) or late TCMR includes augmentation of existing immunosuppression, and mild acute TCMR may resolve without additional immunosuppression. Patients on cyclosporine (CSA) should be switched to TAC if there are no contraindications, and an additional class of immunosuppression, such as an antimetabolite or mTOR inhibitor, may be added to a CNI-based regimen. Initial treatment of moderate or severe acute or late TCMR includes high dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg IV daily for 1–3 days) with a subsequent taper (e.g., prednisone 40–80 mg daily, decreased by 10–20 mg decrements until tapered off). Infection prophylaxis should be administered concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids. Approximately 60%-90% of recipients with acute TCMR respond to high-dose corticosteroids, though response may be lower for late TCMR, and late TCMR has been associated with lower graft survival and development of ductopenic rejection in those with poor response. In cases of suboptimal response, repeat liver biopsy may be necessary and close clinician–pathologist collaboration is essential.

AASLD/AST practice guideline — post-transplant monitoring and diagnostic evaluation indicates that the frequency of monitoring with liver tests should be individualized by the transplant center according to the time from liver transplant (LT), the complications from LT, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause (grade 1, level A). Depending on the pattern of liver tests, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and sonography may be appropriate (grade 1, level A). Liver histology should be obtained when parenchymal injury is suspected as the cause of abnormal liver tests (grade 1, level A). Bilomas and biliary cast syndrome should be managed in a center with expertise in LT medicine, radiology, and biliary endoscopy (grade 1, level A). Hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis is most readily assessed initially by Doppler ultrasound, but angiography is usually required to confirm the diagnosis and plan therapy (grade 1, level B). Rejection can be reliably diagnosed only on the basis of liver histology; a biopsy sample should be taken before treatment initiation and classified according to the Banff criteria (grade 1, level A).

Late rejection after adult liver transplant — definition, diagnosis, risk factors, and management: Late rejection is defined as rejection that has its onset more than 90 days after transplantation, with two recognized forms: cellular rejection and ductopenic rejection. Both forms are, until the late stages, asymptomatic, the diagnosis is made through abnormal liver tests and can be confirmed only on the basis of histology, and the Banff criteria have been adopted to define the nature and severity. Risk factors include reduction of immunosuppression, pre-LT autoimmune liver disease, and concurrent administration of interferon (for HCV treatment). In mild cases of cellular rejection, an increase in maintenance levels of immunosuppression may be sufficient; in histologically moderate or severe cases, the treatment should be a short course of increased immunosuppression (eg, methyl prednisolone at 500 mg/day or prednisolone at 200 mg/day for 3 days) followed by an increase in the baseline immunosuppression. A full response (defined as a return to normal liver tests) is seen in only approximately half of patients, with approximately 25% developing a further episode of cellular rejection and 25% developing ductopenic rejection.

Adult liver transplantation — acute antibody-mediated rejection diagnosis and initial management are specified as follows: In adult liver transplant recipients, acute antibody-mediated rejection should be suspected in a recipient with unexplained graft dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hypocomplementemia, and donor-specific antibody testing and liver biopsy should be obtained with C4d staining to assess for signature histologic features (Strong, Level 3). Initial treatment of acute antibody-mediated rejection in adult liver transplant recipients should include high dose corticosteroids, augmentation of existing immunosuppression with or without addition of an immunosuppressant from a different class (Strong, Level 3).

(Weak, Level 3)". They further state that "In adult liver transplant recipients, the performance of serial measurement of donor-specific antibodies can be individualized in the setting of verified or suspected antibody-mediated rejection that is being treated or monitored. (Weak, Level 4)".

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — post–liver transplant hepatitis C virus (HCV) outcomes — The risk of decompensation after onset of cirrhosis is 15% to 30% within the first year, and mortality is 40% to 55% within 6 to 12 months of the decompensating event; patient survival and graft survival are reduced in HCV-infected recipients with a 5-year patient survival rate of approximately 70%. HCV-infected recipients have higher rates of graft loss when the allograft is from an older donor, and there is a higher risk of cirrhosis when HCV-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients develop acute rejection requiring treatment or comorbid CMV hepatitis. The impact of immunosuppressives on HCV progression is poorly understood, with some data suggesting anti-lymphocyte agents promote HCV-associated liver injury, and post-LT diabetes, insulin resistance, and steatosis have been associated with a higher risk of rapid progression to advanced fibrosis.

Mortality after liver transplantation (LT) — The greatest proportion of deaths or retransplants occur soon after transplantation, with infection and intraoperative and perioperative causes accounting for nearly 60% of deaths and graft losses in the first posttransplant year. After the first year, deaths due to acute infections decline, while malignancies and cardiovascular causes account for a greater proportion of deaths; recurrence of the pretransplant condition, especially hepatitis C virus (HCV) or autoimmune liver disease, is an important cause of graft loss with longer posttransplant survival. Acute or chronic allograft rejection is uncommon throughout the first 10 years after transplantation.

### Antibody-mediated rejection of the liver allograft: an update and a clinico-pathological perspective [^115hAvjP]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibody-mediated rejection after liver transplantation is an under-recognised cause of allograft injury. While definitions of acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection have increased clinical awareness, timely identification and management of antibody-mediated rejection remain difficult because of complexities in diagnosis and histopathology, lack of treatment protocols, and unclear long-term outcomes. While recent cohort studies assessing the importance of donor-specific antibodies have aided in its diagnosis, literature on the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection in liver transplantation remain limited to case reports and small series. Further increasing the awareness and timely recognition of antibody-mediated rejection post-liver transplantation is crucial in order to stimulate future research and the development of protocols for its diagnosis and treatment. This review will summarise recent advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection in liver transplantation, as well as some of the histopathologic features (on liver biopsy tissue) of acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection.

Adult liver transplantation — induction immunosuppressive therapy utilization and agents are described as follows: Most liver transplantation (LT) programs use parenteral corticosteroids in the immediate post-operative phase. Induction immunosuppressive therapy, defined as potent immunosuppression given immediately prior to liver transplantation, is currently used in 27% of all LT recipients to minimize episodes of rejection within the first three months of LT and may also allow for minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and corticosteroid use to decrease their adverse effects. Induction options consist of lymphocyte-depleting agents (antithymocyte globulin, anti-lymphocyte globulin, and alemtuzumab) and non-lymphocyte-depleting agents or interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL2-RA) (basiliximab and daclizumab). Both anti-lymphocyte globulin and daclizumab are no longer commercially available, and alemtuzumab has been associated with a higher risk for infection and malignancy, while recent data on basiliximab and anti-thymocyte globulin did not demonstrate this risk.

AASLD–AST guideline recommendation grading — recommendations were assigned a strength "based on the level of evidence, risk-benefit ratio and patient preferences". The guideline states that "Recommendations were graded as strong when supporting evidence was robust and consistent to allow the adoption of the recommendations by clinicians as standard of care", and "Recommendations were graded as weak when the evidence was weaker, inconsistent or conditional and alternative approaches were available, to allow clinicians to be flexible in their decision-making". Agreement or disagreement on each guideline statement was voted upon by each member of the writing group using the Alchemer survey platform.

Liver tests after liver transplantation (LT) — monitoring and evaluation are guided by individualized schedules and targeted diagnostics. The frequency of monitoring with liver tests should be individualized by the transplant center according to the time from LT, the complications from LT, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause (grade 1, level A). When abnormal liver tests are recognized in a healthy, asymptomatic LT recipient, it is reasonable to repeat the tests in 1 to 2 weeks, and investigations should include a thorough history and examination, appropriate laboratory tests, and Doppler ultrasound of the liver. Depending on the pattern of liver tests, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and sonography may be appropriate (grade 1, level A), and appropriate biliary imaging includes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and/or ultrasound. Liver histology should be obtained when parenchymal injury is suspected as the cause of abnormal liver tests (grade 1, level A), and it should not be assumed without appropriate histological confirmation that abnormal liver tests represent immunemediated damage.

Adult liver transplantation — maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus: In the absence of contraindications, tacrolimus monotherapy should be considered as maintenance immunosuppression in patients at low risk for rejection (e.g., non-immune mediated liver disease), as it has similar graft survival when compared to combination therapy (Strong, Level 3). Combination therapy with tacrolimus and an antimetabolite or a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor should be considered for adult liver transplant recipients who require reduced exposure to tacrolimus due to adverse effects (e.g., renal dysfunction) (Strong, Level 3). Once daily extended-release formulations of tacrolimus should be used similarly as twice daily immediate-release tacrolimus, as they are equally effective for the prevention of rejection and maintenance of allograft survival (Strong, Level 3). TAC monotherapy is feasible after three months post-LT in patients at low risk for rejection, and TAC is associated with long-term complications, including renal dysfunction, increased risk of malignancy and diabetes.

AASLD/AST practice guideline — immunosuppression management after liver transplant states that immunosuppressive drugs for LT recipients should be prescribed and monitored only by those with knowledge and expertise in that area, and the choice of agents will depend on many factors, and no one regimen can be recommended for any patient (grade 2, level A). Every patient's immunosuppressive regimen should be reviewed at least every 6 months and modified as required with the goal of minimizing long-term toxicities (grade 1, level B). Although the long-term withdrawal of all immunosuppression can be achieved in a small number of patients, this should be undertaken only with select recipients and under close supervision (grade 2, level C).

Adult liver transplantation — induction immunosuppression agents: Anti-thymocyte globulin has uncertain benefit at minimizing acute rejection at one year post-liver transplantation (LT) based on six RCT, and alemtuzumab results are less favorable, with the one randomized study terminated early due to increased deaths; these results do not support their use in LT recipients. Basiliximab, the only commercially available IL2-RA, in a Cochrane analysis of adults undergoing LT was found to reduce all-cause mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93) and graft failure (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.70) versus corticosteroids alone, although this evidence is based on two small RCT at high risk of bias.

Adult liver transplantation — Cytomegalovirus (CMV) management recommendations specify that high-risk recipients (CMV-seronegative recipients of CMV-seropositive donor organs) should receive prophylaxis with ganciclovir or valganciclovir for a minimum of 3 months after transplantation (grade 1, level B). The treatment of LT recipients with CMV should be maintained until viremia and all symptoms have resolved (grade 2, level B). Prophylaxis against CMV should be resumed whenever LT recipients receive anti-lymphocyte therapy for the treatment of rejection and should be continued for 1 to 3 months after the treatment of rejection (grade 2, level B). The treatment of a CMV infection should consist of consideration of immunosuppression reduction and high-dose intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir with a minimum of 2 weeks of treatment, and treatment should be continued to complete the resolution of all symptoms and viremia (grade 1, level A). Resistant virus should be suspected in patients with a history of prolonged ganciclovir or valganciclovir exposure who have a persistent or progressive infection despite treatment with high-dose intravenous ganciclovir; in such instances, genotypic assays should be performed, and consideration should be given to the initiation of foscarnet with or in substitution for ganciclovir (grade 1, level B).

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — posttransplant antiviral therapy for HCV — Posttransplant antiviral therapy is generally reserved for those showing evidence of progressive disease manifested by moderate to severe necroinflammation or mild to moderate fibrosis, and the initiation of antiviral therapy is recommended when significant histological disease is present. The primary goal of post-LT antiviral therapy is the achievement of sustained viral clearance because this outcome is associated with fibrosis stabilization or regression and improved graft survival. In patients receiving peginterferon and ribavirin, the pooled estimated rate of acute graft rejection is 5% and is generally reversible with immunosuppressive adjustment, and cholestatic fibrosing hepatitis has been described during antiviral therapy that responds to discontinuation of interferon and amplification of immunosuppression in most cases.

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — recommendations for recurrent HCV after LT — Liver biopsy is useful in monitoring disease severity and progression and in distinguishing recurrent HCV disease from other causes of liver enzyme elevations (grade 1, level C). Prophylactic antiviral therapy has no current role in the management of HCV disease (grade 1, level A). Moderate acute rejection should be treated with increased maintenance immunosuppression and corticosteroid boluses, whereas lymphocyte-depleting drugs should be avoided (grade 1, level B). Antiviral therapy is indicated for significant histological disease: grade 3 or higher inflammatory activity and/or stage 2 or higher fibrosis (on a scale of 4) or cholestatic hepatitis; peginterferon and ribavirin are the current drugs of choice; the risks and benefits of triple therapy with protease inhibitors are to be determined; and the goal of antiviral therapy is the achievement of a sustained virological response, and this confers a survival benefit (grade 1, class B). Retransplantation for recurrent HCV disease should be considered selectively (grade 2, level B).

Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in liver transplant (LT) recipients — Prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus (CMV) should be resumed whenever LT recipients receive anti-lymphocyte therapy for the treatment of rejection and should be continued for 1 to 3 months after the treatment of rejection (grade 2, level B). CMV remains the most significant opportunistic pathogen affecting LT recipients and produces diverse clinical manifestations and significant morbidity and mortality; the most common clinical syndromes include viremia, bone marrow suppression, and involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Risk factors for CMV include a CMV-seropositive donor organ (especially in the absence of prior immunity, ie, a CMV-seronegative recipient), augmented immunosuppression (especially with the use of anti-lymphocyte antibodies or high-dose mycophenolate), allograft rejection, and coinfection with other immunomodulating viruses (eg, human herpesviruses 6 and 7), bacteria, or fungi.

Adult liver transplant (LT) immunosuppression — determinants and monitoring are outlined as follows: The choice of immunosuppression depends on indication for transplantation with potential effects on disease recurrence, comorbidities, drug side effects (calcineurin inhibitors [CNIs] may cause renal impairment), likelihood of pregnancy (mycophenolate and mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors such as sirolimus are potential teratogens), history of severe or recurrent rejection, prior experience with immunosuppressive agents, and history of or risk for cancers or infections. There is no reliable marker for determining the effective level of immunosuppression; dosing is guided by clinical, laboratory, and histological response, and CNI dosing is guided by drug levels with target levels after 3 months of 5 to 10 ng/mL for tacrolimus and 100 to 150 ng/mL for cyclosporine (whole blood trough levels), with a target whole blood trough level for sirolimus of 5 ng/mL; the need for therapeutic drug monitoring for mycophenolate is uncertain. Most LT recipients need lifelong immunosuppression to maintain graft function, though a very small number develop operational tolerance and do not require long-term immunosuppression.

Histologic features include diffuse lymphohistiocytic or polymorphous infiltrate in the portal or perivenular areas, bile duct inflammation and damage with absence of or rare small bile duct loss, subendothelial inflammation or endotheliitis of veins, and fibrosis is uncommon. For Mild (RAI < 4), proposed treatment is to augment existing immunosuppression, including change from cyclosporine to tacrolimus if applicable, and consider adding a second class of immunosuppressant (antimetabolite or mTOR inhibitor). For Moderate or severe (RAI > 4), proposed therapy includes high dose methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg IV) followed by steroid taper and augmenting existing immunosuppression, including change from cyclosporine to tacrolimus if applicable.

AASLD–AST adult liver transplantation — chronic ductopenic rejection management recommendations state that in adult liver transplant recipients, chronic ductopenic rejection should be treated early (when there is < 50% bile duct loss or ductopenia on liver biopsy) with augmentation of existing immunosuppression, in order to maximize treatment response and reversibility (Strong, Level 4); adult recipients with chronic ductopenic rejection who are taking cyclosporine should be switched to tacrolimus, if there are no contraindications (Strong, Level 3); mycophenolate mofetil or a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may be added to adult recipients with chronic ductopenic rejection who are on tacrolimus monotherapy (Weak, Level 4); and recipients with progressive chronic ductopenic rejection despite adjustments in immunosuppressive therapy should be considered for retransplantation (Strong, Level 3).

### Detection of HCV antigens in liver graft: relevance to the management of recurrent post-liver transplant hepatitis C [^116dJFv1]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the immunohistochemical detection of liver hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens (HCV-Ag) could support the histologic diagnosis and influence the clinical management of post-liver transplantation (LT) liver disease. A total of 215 liver specimens from 152 HCV-positive patients with post-LT liver disease were studied. Histologic coding was: hepatitis (126), rejection (34), undefined (24; coexisting rejection grade I and hepatitis), or other (31). The percentage of HCV-Ag infected hepatocytes were evaluated, on frozen sections, by an immunoperoxidase technique. HCV-Ag were detectable early in 57% of cases within 30 days post-LT, 92% of cases between 31 and 180 days, and 74% of cases after more than 180 days. Overall, HCV-Ag were detected more frequently in histologic hepatitis as compared to rejection (P < 0.0001) with a higher percentage of positive hepatocytes (P < 0.00001). In 16 patients with a high number of HCV-Ag-positive hepatocytes (65%; range 40–90%) a clinical diagnosis of recurrent hepatitis (RHC) was made despite inconclusive histopathologic diagnosis. Multivariate analysis identified the percentage of HCV-Ag-positive hepatocytes and the time post-LT as independent predictors for RHC (P = 0.008 and P = 0.041, respectively) and the number of HCV-Ag-positive hepatocytes ≥ 50% as the only independent predictor for nonresponse (P < 0.001) in 26 patients treated with alpha-interferon plus ribavirin. In conclusion, HCV reinfection occurs early post-LT, reaching its peak within 6 months. Immunohistochemical detection of post-LT HCV reinfection support the diagnosis of hepatitis when the histologic features are not conclusive. A high number of infected cells, independently from the genotype, represents a negative predictive factor of response to antiviral treatment.

Adult liver transplant — management of suspected antiviral resistance states that resistant virus should be suspected in patients with a history of prolonged ganciclovir or valganciclovir exposure who have a persistent or progressive infection despite treatment with high-dose intravenous ganciclovir (grade 1, level A). In such instances, genotypic assays should be performed, and consideration should be given to the initiation of foscarnet with or in substitution for ganciclovir (grade 1, level B). Options for antiviral treatment include intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily adjusted for renal impairment) and oral valganciclovir (900 mg twice daily adjusted for renal impairment); for those with more severe disease or gastrointestinal involvement, intravenous ganciclovir is preferable. A minimum of 2 weeks of treatment is recommended for those with rapid resolution of symptoms, but treatment should be continued until there is complete resolution of both symptoms and viremia. Whenever possible, a reduction in immunosuppression should be combined with antiviral therapy. Note that valganciclovir is not approved for use in LT, and ganciclovir resistance is uncommon in solid organ transplant recipients.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^111tbAtp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Liver biopsy in suspected DILI — In general, persistence of biochemical abnormalities lowers the threshold for liver biopsy, whereas most DILI cases show a dramatic decline in liver biochemistries after the presumed causative agent is stopped. Some experts consider a less than 50% decline in the peak ALT value 30 days after stopping the suspected agent as reducing the likelihood of a DILI diagnosis, while others place the cut-off time for significant fall in ALT at 60 days. For cholestatic injury, the lack of a significant drop in AP or bilirubin (> 50% drop in peak ULN or drop to < twice ULN) at 180 days is considered significant, and considering a biopsy at 60 days for unresolved acute hepatocellular and 180 days for cholestatic DILI is reasonable. Conversely, if liver biochemistries are trending down, albeit slowly, then delaying liver biopsy is justified. A biopsy is recommended when AIH remains on the differential and certainly if immunosuppressive drugs are continued; if chronic injury including a vanishing bile duct syndrome is suspected, a liver biopsy is indicated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes; and occasionally a liver biopsy may be necessary when continued use or contemplated rechallenge with a suspected medication is clinically necessary. Biopsy may also be warranted in those who have received a previous liver transplant to exclude competing pathologies such as rejection.

### Hepatitis C therapy before and after liver transplantation [^116MH8Yo]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

1. Pretransplant therapy, using a low-accelerating-dose regimen, is an option for patients with mildly decompensated liver disease and low laboratory Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores. Achievement of an on-treatment virologic response is the goal of therapy. Preliminary data suggest that up to two-thirds of patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA-negative on treatment will be hepatitis C virus infection-free post-transplantation. 2. Effective prophylactic therapies are not available. Hepatitis C antibody therapy has been ineffective in preventing hepatitis C virus infection in studies to date. 3. Preemptive antiviral therapy started within weeks of transplantation is limited by tolerability, particularly in patients with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores pre-transplantation. Rates of sustained virologic response vary from 8% to 39%. Histological benefits in virologic nonresponders have been demonstrated. 4. Posttransplant antiviral therapy in those with evidence of recurrent disease is the mainstay of management. A combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the treatment of choice, and sustained virologic response is achieved with 48 weeks of treatment in approximately 30% of treated patients. Attainment of early loss of hepatitis C virus RNA is highly predictive of sustained virologic response. Histologic improvements are seen in responders. Survival is prolonged among those achieving a sustained virologic response. 5. Posttransplant antiviral therapy is limited by poor tolerability and the frequent need for dose reductions and/or discontinuation. Immunologic complications, including acute rejection, chronic rejection, and autoimmune-like hepatitis, occur in association with therapy, albeit at low rates. 6. Hepatitis C virus-infected liver transplant recipients represent an important patient population in need of new therapeutics options to prevent patient and graft losses due to recurrent hepatitis C virus disease.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^1154Wt33]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Protocol liver biopsy after liver transplantation (LT) — current use, findings, and impact are summarized as follows: Few LT centers currently perform protocol liver biopsies in patients with normal liver chemistries, although liver biopsies are safe and can detect subclinical graft injuries, and the direct impact of protocol liver biopsies on long-term graft survival remains unproven. In a multicenter study of recipients with normal liver tests more than three years out from LT (n = 190), portal inflammation, fibrosis, and lobular inflammation were detected in 144 (75.8%), 119 (62.6%) and 115 (60.5%) liver biopsies, respectively. In another study of LT patients (n = 211), 32% had minimal histological inflammation, 57% showed significant histological inflammation and 23% advanced fibrosis (> F2) on surveillance biopsies, which were not predicted by lab parameters; immunosuppression was modified in 79% of patients and there were no biopsy-related complications. In a retrospective series of 213 protocol liver biopsies in 110 recipients, there were nine late-onset acute rejections, three isolated perivenular inflammation, one plasma cell-rich rejection (PCR), and one early chronic ductopenic rejection (CDR); adjustment in immunosuppressive therapy led to improvement in the modified hepatic activity index (HAI) score grading in 10/14 cases (71.4%). Despite these data, the role of protocol liver biopsy in the post-HCV era is not well-defined, and emerging biomarkers and non-invasive tools may provide a more attractive means for monitoring and maintaining allograft health.

### From immunosuppression to tolerance [^113Pvv7p]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The past three decades have seen liver transplantation becoming a major therapeutic approach in the management of end-stage liver diseases. This is due to the dramatic improvement in survival after liver transplantation as a consequence of the improvement of surgical and anaesthetic techniques, of post-transplant medico-surgical management and of prevention of disease recurrence and other post-transplant complications. Improved use of post-transplant immunosuppression to prevent acute and chronic rejection is a major factor in these improved results. The liver has been shown to be more tolerogenic than other organs, and matching of donor and recipients is mainly limited to ABO blood group compatibility. However, long-term immunosuppression is required to avoid severe acute and chronic rejection and graft loss. With the current immunosuppression protocols, the risk of acute rejection requiring additional therapy is 10–40% and the risk of chronic rejection is below 5%. However, the development of histological lesions in the graft in long-term survivors suggest atypical forms of graft rejection may develop as a consequence of under-immunosuppression. The backbone of immunosuppression remains calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) mostly in association with steroids in the short-term and mycophenolate mofetil or mTOR inhibitors (everolimus). The occurrence of post-transplant complications related to the immunosuppressive therapy has led to the development of new protocols aimed at protecting renal function and preventing the development of de novo cancer and of dysmetabolic syndrome. However, there is no new class of immunosuppressive drugs in the pipeline able to replace current protocols in the near future. The aim of a full immune tolerance of the graft is rarely achieved since only 20% of selected patients can be weaned successfully off immunosuppression. In the future, immunosuppression will probably be more case oriented aiming to protect the graft from rejection and at reducing the risk of disease recurrence and complications related to immunosuppressive therapy. Such approaches will include strategies aiming to promote stable long-term immunological tolerance of the liver graft.

### Histologic features of allograft livers in patients treated for rejection before biopsy [^1151kzh7]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy is essential for management in liver transplant patients with clinical features suspicious for acute cellular rejection (ACR). As more patients are transplanted for noninfectious indications, it has become increasingly common for them to receive treatment for presumed ACR before biopsy. The effect of pretreatment on the classic histologic triad of ACR's mixed portal inflammation, endothelialitis, and bile duct damage is not well described. Here we report a retrospective study of 70 liver transplant biopsies performed on 53 patients for suspected ACR between 2018 and 2021. Thirty-seven biopsies had a clinical diagnosis of ACR after biopsy. Pretreatment with steroids, antithymocyte globulin, or other increased immunosuppression was given before biopsy in 17 of 37 cases; 20 not-pretreated cases acted as controls. A representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide from each biopsy was reviewed independently in a blinded fashion by 3 hepatic pathologists, graded according to the Banff system, assigned a Rejection Activity Index (RAI), and assessed for other histologic features. We found that pretreated biopsies had significantly less portal inflammation (P < .001), less endothelialitis (P < .001), lower RAI (P < .001), and less prominent eosinophils (P = .048) compared to not-pretreated biopsies. There was no significant difference for the other examined variables, including bile duct inflammation/damage (P = .32). Our findings suggest that portal inflammation and endothelialitis become less prominent with pretreatment, whereas bile duct inflammation/damage may take longer to resolve. When evaluating biopsies for suspected ACR, the finding of bile duct inflammation/damage should raise the possibility of partially treated ACR, even in the absence of endothelialitis and portal inflammation.

### International consensus recommendations for anesthetic and intensive care management of lung transplantation. An EACTAIC, SCA, ISHLT, ESOT, ESTS, and AST approved document [^115mXgQt]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Vascular complications after lung transplant — Strength: strong consensus: Pulmonary vascular anastomotic complications should be entertained in post-lung transplant patients with unexplained hypoxemia, particularly if it occurs in concert with pulmonary hypertension. Strength: strong consensus: CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiography can be used to diagnose pulmonary vascular anastomotic complications, bronchoscopy should be diagnostic in the setting of torsion, and in the operating room direct assessment of the pressure gradient across the left atrial anastomosis can be performed. Strength: strong consensus: Significant pulmonary vascular anastomotic stenosis should be corrected surgically if discovered intra-operatively or immediately post operatively. Strength: strong consensus: Late diagnosed (> 2 weeks post-operative) pulmonary vascular anastomotic stenosis should be addressed with angioplasty and stenting if anatomically feasible, whereas in patients diagnosed within 2 weeks of surgery clinicians must weigh the relative risks of surgical intervention vs endovascular intervention on a fresh anastomosis. Strength: strong consensus: Diagnosis of torsion requires a high index of suspicion and emergent surgical exploration and correction if suspected due to the risk for rapid progression to irreversible graft infarction. Strength: strong consensus: An undiagnosed venous anastomotic thrombosis may result in infarction and gangrene of the pulmonary allograft leading to sepsis and possible death, and urgent transplantectomy is then indicated.

### Targeted individual prophylaxis offers superior risk stratification for cytomegalovirus reactivation after liver transplantation [^111WojtW]. Liver Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can reactivate following liver transplantation. Management of patients currently considered low risk based on pretransplant serology remains contentious, with universal prophylaxis and preemptive strategies suffering from significant deficiencies. We hypothesized that a CMV-specific T cell assay performed early after transplant as part of a preemptive strategy could better stratify "low-risk" (recipient seropositive) patients. We conducted a prospective, blinded, observational study in 75 adult recipients. QuantiFERON-cytomegalovirus was performed both before and at multiple times after transplant. Low-risk patients (n = 58) were monitored as per unit protocol and treatment was commenced if CMV > 1000 copies/mL (DNAemia). Twenty patients needed antiviral treatment for other reasons and were censored (mainly for rejection or herpes simplex virus infection); 19/38 (50%) of the remaining low-risk patients developed DNAemia at mean 34.6 days after transplant. A week 2 result of < 0.1 IU/mL was significantly associated with risk of subsequent DNAemia (hazard ratio [HR], 6.9; P = 0.002). The positive predictive value of 80% suggests these patients are inappropriately labeled low risk and are actually at high likelihood of CMV reactivation. A secondary cutoff of < 0.2 IU/mL was associated with moderate risk (HR, 2.8; P = 0.01). In conclusion, a protocol based on a single early CMV-specific T cell based assay would offer improved risk stratification and individualization of patient management after transplant. This could offer improved drug and service utilization and potentially result in significant improvements over both currently used protocols to manage supposedly low-risk patients.

### Preoperative and intraoperative predictors of postoperative morbidity, poor graft function, and early rejection in 190 patients undergoing liver transplantation… [^114XLibp]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

The preoperative physiological score predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality for noncardiac surgical patients. 36 The primary predefined composite end point was either in-hospital death or prolonged postoperative hospitalization associated with morbidity. Postoperative hospitalization was defined as the number of days from the day of operation to hospital discharge. A 14-day cutoff was selected a priori for several reasons. At our hospital the care map for liver transplantation targets discharge of the patient from the hospital before the 14th postoperative day, with most patients being discharged within 13 days of surgery. In fact, the 25th percentile for postoperative length of stay was 9 days in this cohort; hence, a 14-day cutoff represented a marked prolongation in the length of stay, not a trivial prolongation of 1 or 2 days that could be due to "soft factors" such as physician preference or lack of transportation.

More important, by limiting this definition to patients with coexisting morbidity, these criteria excluded any patient with a prolonged hospitalization who was free of morbidity yet still in the hospital for other reasons, eg, waiting for transportation or placement. The following 3 secondary outcomes were recorded: primary graft nonfunction, defined as acute graft dysfunction necessitating retransplantation; poor early graft function defined previously9 as a prothrombin time greater than 16 seconds on postoperative day 2 and a peak postoperative alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level greater than 2000 U/L; and early histologic evidence of rejection. In this large prospective study, we observed relatively high incidences of prolonged hospitalization associated with morbidity, suboptimal graft function, and early rejection after orthotopic liver transplantation.

Patients with prolonged hospitalization had evidence of multiple-system organ dysfunction, with higher incidences of pulmonary, renal, and infectious complications. There were several predictors of death or prolonged hospitalization associated with morbidity. In contrast, we found few predictors of other important outcomes, such as primary graft nonfunction, poor early graft function, and early rejection. In addition, increasing recipient age and increasing days of preoperative hospitalization were associated with adverse outcome. Four variables that may reflect a greater degree of surgical trauma and intensity of resuscitation also predicted adverse outcome in the univariate analyses.

### The voice of the patient… [^113ySmym]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

transplanted organs are recovered from deceased donors, but a substantial contribution of kidneys, and to a lesser extent, partial liver organs come from living donors. Organ transplantation requires pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management before and after receipt. Post-transplant management typically addresses four main objectives: prevention of organ rejection by the recipient's immune system, treatment of the underlying medical condition, treatment. rejection include induction immunosuppression with intensive combination regimens, maintenance immunosuppression with less intensive combination regimens, and additional medications for treatment of acute organ rejection. Other treatments include medications to prevent and treat viral, bacterial, fungal and other opportunistic infections; medications for treating the underlying medical. 4 Adherence to treatment regimens is important for health outcomes of patients who have received organ transplants.

Treatment regimens are often life-long, and are critical for the long-term health of the patients and transplanted organs. For many, adherence to treatment is a significant challenge due to the complexity of treatment regimens, side effects of treatments, and numerous other factors. managing complex treatment regimens. While some participants expressed satisfaction with the effectiveness of their current regimen, others shared their difficulties with side effects and the burden of frequent monitoring, testing, and clinic visits. Participants discussed their hopes for improved treatment options throughout the meeting.
- Adherence to treatment regimens is a significant challenge for organ transplant recipients. Participants described treatment regimens as complex and strict; often requiring numerous daily medications, frequent monitoring of the health of the transplanted organ, and consistent visits to healthcare providers.

Adherence is also affected by the burden of treatment side effects. The patient input generated through this Patient-Focused Drug Development meeting and the public. described their experience as an "intense struggle. " Participants stated that options for patients who experience organ rejection and lose their graft are limited; with one participant summarizing the outcomes as "either you die or get another organ. "
- Infection – Participants described being more susceptible to various infections, flu, colds, and with slow recovery, and more frequent and more severe occurrences. One participant said that sicknesses which would normally last only for a day or two instead last for a week and occasionally require hospitalization.

### Unexpected hepatitis B virus infection after liver transplantation… [^116jCdUY]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to testing for HBV DNA at 4–6 weeks after transplantation, clinicians caring for liver transplant recipients should consider testing for HBV DNA 1 year after transplantation or at any time if signs and symptoms of viral hepatitis develop, even if previous tests were negative. All suspected unexpected cases of donor‐derived hepatitis B in the United States are reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for review by the Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee. Suspected cases are referred to CDC to investigate whether donor-derived disease transmission occurred and identify interventions to prevent transmission and improve outcomes. An alternative hypothesis is that HCV coinfection suppressed HBV replication in certain donors, resulting in occult HBV infection. In 20% of HBV/HCV coinfections, patients can test negative for all HBV serum markers. Subsequent immunosuppression or treatment for HCV infection among liver recipients might lead to reactivation of HBV infection after transplantation.

The observed interval between transplantation and diagnosis of HBV infection in these cases is similar to the prolonged interval between transplantation and reactivation of hepatitis B infection among recipients of a liver from a donor who was total anti-HBc seropositive. In the United States, liver transplants from HCV-seropositive donors increased from 308 in 2014 to 644 in 2018, and liver transplants from HCV RNA-positive donors increased from 236 in 2015 to 418 in 2018. Additional testing for HBV DNA 1 year after transplantation should be considered for liver transplant recipients, especially if the donor had risk factors for hepatitis B, including injection drug use or positive HCV serology. Recipients with signs or symptoms of liver injury after transplantation should be tested for viral hepatitis, even if previous hepatitis B or hepatitis C testing was negative.

More broadly, providers caring for recipients of organs from donors who recently injected drugs or are HCV-seropositive should maintain awareness of infectious complications of drug use and monitor recipients accordingly.
