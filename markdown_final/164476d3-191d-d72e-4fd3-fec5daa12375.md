For uri

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about URI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the user truly means URI (upper respiratory infection) or UTI (urinary tract infection). Then, I should verify the epidemiology and etiologies of URI. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies and thresholds for testing. After that, I need to examine treatment options, including symptomatic care, when to consider antibiotics, and special populations. Finally, I should consider prevention, complications, and stewardship, and close with a concise, practical summary anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating URI with UTI. URI stands for upper respiratory infection, commonly known as the common cold, whereas UTI refers to urinary tract infection; these are distinct entities with different pathophysiology, diagnostics, and management, so I should not mix them up.

> I will now examine the epidemiology and etiologies to frame pretest probability. URIs are extremely common, with adults averaging two to three colds per year and children experiencing even more, and they are caused by a wide array of respiratory viruses, most frequently rhinoviruses, though coronaviruses, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and metapneumovirus also contribute; importantly, influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 can mimic cold symptoms but are distinct pathogens with different risks and management implications, so I should keep those in mind when symptoms are atypical or severe.

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach. Typical URI symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and sometimes low-grade fever; symptoms usually peak within 2–3 days and resolve within a week, though cough can persist longer. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, and routine testing is not indicated for uncomplicated cases; however, I need to check for red flags or alternative diagnoses when symptoms are severe, prolonged, or atypical, and consider testing for influenza, COVID-19, or streptococcal pharyngitis when clinically suspected, especially in high-risk patients or during outbreaks.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm that most URIs are viral and self-limited, so antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated colds; management is supportive with analgesics, antipyretics, hydration, and rest, and I should counsel on expected course to set expectations and reduce unnecessary reconsultation. If symptoms persist beyond about 10 days, worsen after initial improvement, or are accompanied by focal signs such as ear pain, sinus tenderness, or purulent sputum, I should reconsider complications or alternative diagnoses and evaluate accordingly [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios where my threshold changes. In older adults, immunocompromised patients, or those with chronic lung disease, I should have a lower threshold to evaluate for complications such as pneumonia, sinusitis, or otitis media. In children, I need to assess for otitis media, asthma exacerbations, or early bronchiolitis, and in patients with COVID-19 or influenza risk factors, targeted testing and antivirals may be appropriate if initiated early. I should double-check that my management aligns with current public health guidance and local epidemiology before ordering tests or prescribing antivirals [^notfound].

> I should confirm prevention strategies next. Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of URI prevention, and I need to emphasize frequent handwashing, especially after contact with sick individuals or high-touch surfaces. In healthcare settings, standard precautions and respiratory hygiene reduce transmission. For influenza, annual vaccination is recommended for eligible patients, and during outbreaks, masking and social distancing can mitigate spread; I need to tailor these messages to the patient's risk profile and community transmission levels [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the user actually meant UTI rather than URI? If that is the case, I should pivot to UTI management principles: distinguish uncomplicated from complicated disease, use first-line agents such as nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole when local resistance is under 20%, or fosfomycin for uncomplicated cystitis, avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to resistance and adverse effects, and align durations with guideline-concordant short courses whenever feasible. For recurrent UTI, I should consider nonantibiotic strategies first and reserve prophylaxis for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making, with ongoing stewardship and reassessment of benefit [^1132XuuX] [^114AqSwd] [^115HJY1S].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: URI is a viral upper respiratory infection managed with supportive care, no routine antibiotics, and selective testing when indicated. I should reinforce expected course, return precautions, and prevention through hand hygiene and vaccination where applicable, while keeping a watchful eye for complications or alternative diagnoses that would change management.

URI (upper respiratory infection) is a **viral illness** [^notfound] characterized by nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, and low-grade fever, typically resolving within 7–10 days. Management is **supportive** [^notfound] — rest, hydration, analgesics, and antipyretics — with antibiotics not indicated unless bacterial co-infection is suspected. Complications include sinusitis, otitis media, and bronchitis; red flags (high fever, dyspnea, chest pain, altered mental status) warrant further evaluation. Prevention relies on hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.

---

## Clinical presentation

URIs typically present with the following **symptoms**:

- **Nasal congestion**: Stuffiness or blockage of the nasal passages.
- **Rhinorrhea**: Runny nose with clear or mucous discharge.
- **Cough**: Dry or productive, often worse at night.
- **Sore throat**: Scratchy or painful throat, often mild.
- **Sneezing**: Frequent sneezing episodes.
- **Low-grade fever**: Temperature < 38.5°C (101.3°F), more common in children.
- **Fatigue and malaise**: General feeling of tiredness and discomfort.

Symptoms usually peak within 2–3 days and resolve within 7–10 days, though a cough may persist for up to 2–3 weeks.

---

## Etiology

URIs are **primarily caused by viruses**, including:

| **Virus family** | **Common examples** |
|-|-|
| Rhinoviruses | Most common cause of the common cold |
| Coronaviruses | Including seasonal coronaviruses |
| Parainfluenza viruses | Associated with croup and bronchiolitis |
| Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) | Common in infants and young children |
| Influenza viruses | Cause influenza, more severe than the common cold |
| Adenoviruses | Associated with pharyngitis and conjunctivitis |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis of URI is **primarily clinical**, based on history and physical examination. Routine laboratory testing is not indicated for uncomplicated cases. However, diagnostic testing may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Influenza testing**: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during influenza season or outbreaks.
- **COVID-19 testing**: PCR or antigen testing when COVID-19 is suspected or during outbreaks.
- **Streptococcal testing**: Rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) or throat culture if streptococcal pharyngitis is suspected.

---

## Management

Management of URI is **supportive and symptomatic**:

- **Rest and hydration**: Adequate rest and fluid intake to maintain hydration.
- **Analgesics and antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever, headache, and body aches.
- **Nasal decongestants**: Short-term use of topical decongestants (e.g. oxymetazoline) or oral antihistamines for nasal congestion.
- **Cough management**: Dextromethorphan or guaifenesin for cough suppression and expectoration.
- **Humidified air**: Humidifiers or steam inhalation to relieve nasal congestion and cough.

Antibiotics are **not indicated** unless bacterial co-infection is suspected (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, or bacterial pneumonia).

---

## Complications

Although most URIs resolve spontaneously, **complications can occur**, particularly in vulnerable populations:

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: Persistent nasal congestion, facial pain, and purulent discharge.
- **Acute otitis media**: Ear pain, tympanic membrane inflammation, and effusion.
- **Bronchitis**: Persistent cough with bronchial inflammation.
- **Pneumonia**: More severe lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in immunocompromised or elderly patients.
- **Exacerbation of chronic conditions**: Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart failure exacerbations.

---

## Prevention

Prevention of URIs focuses on **hygiene and avoidance of exposure**:

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers.
- **Respiratory hygiene**: Covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
- **Avoidance of close contact**: Limiting exposure to individuals with respiratory infections.
- **Vaccination**: Annual influenza vaccination and adherence to COVID-19 vaccination schedules.

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek **medical attention** if they experience:

- **High fever**: Temperature ≥ 38.5°C (101.3°F) lasting more than 3 days.
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
- **Chest pain**: Persistent or severe chest pain.
- **Altered mental status**: Confusion, lethargy, or unconsciousness.
- **Persistent symptoms**: Symptoms lasting longer than 10 days without improvement.
- **Severe ear pain**: Suggestive of otitis media.
- **Immunocompromised status**: Increased risk of complications.

---

URI is a common viral illness with a **self-limited course**; management is supportive, and antibiotics are reserved for suspected bacterial co-infections. Prevention through hygiene and vaccination reduces incidence and complications.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Urinary tract infections: microbial pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and new treatment strategies [^116tjdf4]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, recurrent infections that can be mild to life-threatening. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, together with our increasing understanding of the detrimental effects conferred by broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the health of the beneficial microbiota of the host, has underscored the weaknesses in our current treatment paradigm for UTIs. In this Review, we discuss how recent microbiological, structural, genetic and immunological studies have expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during UTI pathogenesis. These basic scientific findings have the potential to shift the strategy for UTI treatment away from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting conserved aspects of bacterial replication towards pathogen-specific antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that target core determinants of bacterial virulence at the host-pathogen interface.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^113efeWL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens highlight the need for alternative therapies. In this review we examine current management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^113Sj4KX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of bacterial infection, affecting at least 150 million people annually worldwide based on epidemiological estimates over 2 decades ago, with recent estimates as high as 400 million. Half of women will have at least one UTI during their lifetime and of these ~ 30% will develop recurrent UTI (defined as symptomatic culture-proven UTI at least twice in 6 months or three times in a year). Recurrent UTI is associated with the development of intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which may serve as the nidus for subsequent infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent UTI is associated with repetitive and extended antibiotic use and poses significant therapeutic and public health issues owing to alarming increases in antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has been unable to keep up with the concerning rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Current vaccine trials for UTI have had limited impact. Here, we review the putative role of bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a therapeutic for UTI, highlight patient and microbiological factors that might impact successful treatment, and suggest reporting standards for future work to help to advance the field.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^1174T2WE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^115wCJ11]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1116o5L4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113AFvAL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

### Urinary tract infection pathogenesis: host factors [^113tCV6p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Clinically, host factors in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) may be considered as modifiable (eg, behaviors associated with increased risk of UTI, anatomic and functional problems of the urinary tract) and thus potentially amenable to a change in patient behavior or treatment approach, or as intrinsic and nonmodifiable host factors that neither the patient nor the clinician can influence (eg, gender and genetic influences associated with UTI). Although considering nonmodifiable host factors may be discouraging to patients and clinicians at present, some genetic associations have the potential for future predictive value and may interface with future treatments.

### Urinary tract infections [^112J2vFX]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common bacterial infection in children and is considered a public health threat given the mounting rates of antibiotic-resistance among uropathogens. This article highlights recent encouraging developments in UTI research. Further work is necessary to translate the discoveries into accessible, cost-effective technologies that will aid clinicians in real-time decision-making.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in older adults [^1171Mf6J]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116fXk2s]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116uTTsD]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^113AAffU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^111osZb9]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with severe and persistent symptoms, microbiological examination of urine can help the GP to identify the micro-organisms causing the infection. In Nordic countries, many GPs have direct access to point of care testing such as urine phase contrast microscopy, culture, and direct susceptibility testing to identify patients who need antibiotic treatment. In the study by Gágyor and colleagues, only a third of patients with uncomplicated UTI needed antibiotics during the four weeks of follow-up, so a strategy of delayed prescription for patients with light to moderate symptoms might also be a feasible strategy. We need trials of delayed prescriptions for UTI. Delayed prescribing has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections by 50–70%.(this is same sentence repeated in adifferent way!)

Discussion

Of the eight CPGs identified for the assessment and treatment of recurrent UTI, our multidisciplinary review team could only recommend two as being of sufficiently high quality for use without adjustment. Another three were also considered to be of high quality, but these could only be recommended with modifications. This illustrates the need to improve CPG development on this topic. In line with previous evaluations, the scope and purpose and clarity of presentation domains had the highest scores, while the stakeholder involvement and applicability domains had the lowest scores.

The domains requiring further attention from CPG developers are discussed below.

Domain 2: Stakeholder involvement

It is important that the CPG development group includes professionals from all relevant groups, clearly defines CPG users, and seeks the views and thoughts of the target population. This could be achieved throughout a discussion meeting with patients, including patients in the development group or as external referents. Ideally, these patients should be trained to perform these tasks. Five CPGs in this review did consider patients' views during their development, but none reported those views. Simply providing the patients views and thoughts in a supplement helps with this issue. Further improvement for example could be to add "patient recommended" under the levels of evidence.

Domain 3: Rigour of development

Developmental rigour, including adequate assessment of the level of evidence of recommendations, probably influences the content of a CPG the most. We found various methods for reporting the evidence levels and grading recommendations among the included CPGs, which had the potential to hinder the user's ability to compare recommendations. GRADE provides a rigorous and explicit framework for rating the quality of evidence and strength of a recommendation, and its use could help to improve the quality of a CPG. Moreover, it is widely adopted and could be used as a standard for developing CPGs.

Consistent with a previous AGREE review, updating procedures were poorly reported, underlining the need for this to change. There has been little research into the time frame for updating CPGs, but intervals between 1 and 5 years have been suggested. Given that studies regarding prevention and diagnostics for recurrent UTI are far less common than those for studies regarding other pathology (e.g. malignancy), we decided that 5 years is an acceptable time frame. On that basis, six of the eight included CPGs may be considered up to date. Updating a whole guideline is an intensive and time-consuming process. Topics and recommendations often differ in the terms of the need for updating; therefore, partial updating seems like a logical solution.

Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

Key points
- Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
- You can get a cold any time of year.
- Colds usually last less than a week. Overview A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more. Complications Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include: Mild to moderate:

- Middle ear infections
- Sinus infections.

Potentially severe:

- Asthma attacks
- Bronchiolitis
- Bronchitis
- Pneumonia
- Worsening of chronic medical conditions Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems. Causes and spread Causes More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and human metapneumovirus.

SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin. You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116vZ2qd]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115mVcrU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For the primary outcome, the incidence rate in each group was the total number of UTI episodes divided by the total follow-up (exposure) time, reported with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a resampling procedure (bootstrap). The absolute difference between groups was calculated and reported with a 90% bootstrap confidence interval. Non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper limit of the confidence interval was below one UTI episode/year. We estimated relative treatment differences using a negative binomial model with follow-up time included as an exposure variable, recruiting centre as a random effect, and baseline stratification factors (menopausal status and prior UTI frequency) as fixed effects. This model yielded an estimate of the incidence rate ratio, presented with a 95% confidence interval.

Sensitivity analyses excluded days when participants took therapeutic antibiotics for UTI from the follow-up time. We analysed a binary indicator of at least one UTI episode using a mixed effects logistic regression model adjusted for centre and baseline stratification factors. Analyses were primarily conducted in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants observed for at least six months, because these participants were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence. Prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted in intention-to-treat and per protocol populations (participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with preventive treatment; switching between treatment strategies was considered adherent). We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis in a strict per protocol population that included only those participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with initially randomised treatment.

Symptomatically diagnosed UTI incidence in the post-treatment period and microbiologically confirmed UTIs were analysed as for the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and included all participants with data available. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance were compared by χ² or Fisher's exact tests. These analyses are considered exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. We made no adjustments for multiple testing. Domain scores of the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for drug treatment were compared between groups using a two sample t test and an analysis of covariance model adjusted for baseline stratification factors. To account for switching between treatment strategies, adverse events were reported according to treatment received at the time with data summarised by numbers of participants receiving each intervention. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 16. Independent trial steering and data monitoring committees had oversight throughout the trial. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN70219762).

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; P = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^114VaKCN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10⁵ CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^112m772W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review, we evaluated five randomized controlled trials (of 1309 patients) comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Although study protocols and reported outcomes were heterogeneous, two smaller studies that were at high and unclear risk of bias found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics, while three studies with low risk of bias supported antibiotic therapy over NSAIDs in terms of symptom resolution. Furthermore, two studies at low risk of bias found higher risks of pyelonephritis in patients who received NSAIDs versus antibiotics; the third study with low risk of bias also found a higher risk of pyelonephritis in patients receiving NSAIDs, but the confidence interval for the risk difference included zero. In sum, these findings support the use of antibiotics as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTI for both symptom resolution and prevention of pyelonephritis.

Despite the superiority of antibiotic therapy, 39–58% of participants in the NSAID groups achieved symptom resolution by day 3 or 4. For comparison, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials demonstrated clinical success (symptom improvement or resolution by first follow-up visit) in 25–54% of participants in the placebo arms. One possible explanation for why many UTI symptoms resolved without antibiotic therapy is that not all women included in the studies may have had true UTIs. Inclusion in most studies was based on symptoms alone — a commonly accepted approach for uncomplicated UTIsthat is consistent with several clinical practice guidelines from countries where the trials were conducted. – However, clinical symptoms only correctly diagnose UTIs half of the time. Thus, it is possible that a large number of participants may not have had a UTI or been at risk of worsening infection. Indeed, in the four studies that collected urine specimens for culture at the time of inclusion, only 64–86% of patients in either study arm had positive cultures. Women often suffer from urinary symptoms for a host of reasons (e.g. incontinence, medication side effects) that are misdiagnosed as a UTI. Barriers to obtaining timely urine testing often promote alternatives to testing, such as "as needed" antibiotic prescriptions or prescriptions by phone.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10² colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### Molecular determinants of disease severity in urinary tract infection [^112d5sKS]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2021). High credibility.

The most common and lethal bacterial pathogens have co-evolved with the host. Pathogens are the aggressors, and the host immune system is responsible for the defence. However, immune responses can also become destructive, and excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and painful infections of the urinary bladder (acute cystitis) can become debilitating in susceptible patients. Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is the use of bacterial molecules that reprogramme the innate immune system, accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response and avoid severe disease. The power of innate immunity as an arbitrator of health and disease is also highly relevant for emerging pathogens, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1176LkpS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — conditional treatment and acute self-treatment: Conditional treatment uses a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or follow-up without treatment, with antibiotics started only if symptoms progress or do not resolve, and has not been studied in women older than 65 years or with rUTI; in women younger than 65 years, resolution without antibiotics occurred in 20% to 47%, but one study reported pyelonephritis in the placebo group at 2% to 2.6%. In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114swyqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which agent is the most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (November 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered all trials where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 10 studies, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between the treatments under study with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. When cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, there were better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and fewer recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group. There was only one other statistically significant difference when comparing outpatient versus inpatient treatment. Gestational age at birth was greater in women from the outpatient group (38.86 versus 37.21), while birthweight was on average greater in the inpatient group (3120 versus 2659).

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Does prompt treatment of urinary tract infection in preschool children prevent renal scarring: mixed retrospective and prospective audits [^113pWyvc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic

Recent childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) guidelines presume that few kidney defects can be prevented, and strive to minimise renal tract imaging.
All published childhood UTI guidelines advise prompt treatment, but none provide target times.

What this study adds

Treating children's urinary tract infections in ≤ 3 days, more than halves the risk of them acquiring kidney scars.
GPs can halve the kidney scarring rates in young children by active management using a direct-access service.
This reduction in scarring rates could not have been detected if the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines had been implemented locally.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115xMvaN]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.

Methods

In this randomised, open-label, superiority trial, we enrolled participants from 51 UK National Health Service organisations. These participants were community-dwelling (as opposed to hospital inpatient) users of CISC with recurrent UTIs. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis once daily (prophylaxis group) or no prophylaxis (control group) for 12 months by use of an internet-based system with permuted blocks of variable length. Trial and laboratory staff who assessed outcomes were masked to allocation but participants were aware of their treatment group. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months. Participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Change in antimicrobial resistance of urinary and faecal bacteria was monitored as a secondary outcome. The AnTIC trial is registered at ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, number 2013-002556-32.

Findings

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1.3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1.1–1.6) in the prophylaxis group and 2.6 (2.3–2.9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0.52 (0.44–0.61; p < 0.0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation (nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control group with at least one isolate; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p = 0.002).

Interpretation

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112tRjeX]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy has, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to try to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. Only when cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, were there better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and less recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group, but the sample size is insufficient to ensure that differences found in the effect of the drugs were real.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific treatment regimen for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of outcomes measured. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to try to detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

RESULTS

What Is the Definition of cUTI?

cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D).
Children with cUTI have one or more of: localized risk: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple recurrent UTI, generalized risk: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal) and severe clinical presentations: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease.
We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course, variably including severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants, but due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children with pyelonephritis, children with known anatomical or functional abnormalities, extensive parenchymal involvement, septicemia, nosocomial acquisition, renal impairment and recent antibiotics. The limited number of pediatric studies addressing cUTI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1a, and 1b,), have used various definitions, from comprehensive to brief to single complication.– Regarding the cUTI definition in existing guidelines for childhood UTI management, the updated National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline for childhood UTIand recent Canadianand Swissguidelines used varying combinations of severe presentation, renal issues and failure to improve in their definitions, while the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrologyuses severe presentation as the only criterion.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^114eitib]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care.

Participants 309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main outcome measures Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114u2fnH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — states that diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50 000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. This Clinical Practice Guideline was retired May 2021.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1164EvA5]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — antibiotic choice for acute cystitis should incorporate patient and pathogen factors, with specific options and caveats: Antibiotic choice should take into account specific patient factors (allergies, renal function), complicating factors, and uropathogen sensitivity. For acute cystitis in women with rUTI, nitrofurantoin is a key first-line agent; fosfomycin is effective; clinician may need to request sensitivity testing; TMP-SMX can also be used if resistance is less than 20% in the community; and fluoroquinolones are not first-line treatment of acute cystitis without complicating factors.
