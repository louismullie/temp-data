## Question

Pectasol Modified Citrus Pectin and cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for PectaSol (modified citrus pectin) in cancer, with emphasis on prostate cancer, mechanism, safety, and practical guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what PectaSol is and its proposed mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence in prostate cancer, including PSA kinetics and durability. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and preclinical data. After that, I need to assess safety and tolerability. I should also consider limitations and the overall strength of evidence. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical guidance and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I double-check key claims against the cited trials and reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the product and mechanism. PectaSol is a modified citrus pectin formulated to be low molecular weight and low esterification, which enhances oral absorption and enables systemic distribution; its principal proposed anticancer mechanism is competitive inhibition of galectin-3, a β-galactoside–binding lectin implicated in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune suppression, with MCP binding to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3 to block its activity [^113DFo23] [^1175RkQ1] [^1111FP2D].

> Now, I should review the clinical evidence in prostate cancer. Wait, let me verify the pivotal signal. A phase II pilot in 13 men with biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy reported that 7 of 10 evaluable patients experienced a significant increase in PSA doubling time after 12 months of MCP, suggesting slower biochemical progression; however, this was a very small, uncontrolled study, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting it [^111tBFDG]. Hold on, I should verify the larger prospective series. A multicenter phase II trial in nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer used PectaSol-C 4.8 g three times daily for 6 months, with an extension to 12 months if there was no progression; interim and primary analyses suggested high rates of PSA stabilization or improvement in doubling time and low toxicity, with long-term results reportedly showing an 85% long-term response rate, though these remain abstract-level data and should be confirmed in peer-reviewed publication [^1147szj6] [^116FtaeM] [^116uoDRP]. I should double-check the dosing and regimen; yes, 4.8 g three times daily away from meals is consistent across the trial descriptions and registry entry [^1111FP2D].

> Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and preclinical data. Let me consider whether galectin-3 is a credible target in cancer. Multiple reviews and translational studies link galectin-3 to proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy, supporting the biological rationale for MCP's competitive inhibition strategy [^113qSQ3t]. I should confirm preclinical anticancer signals. In vitro and in vivo studies of MCP and related pectin derivatives show reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in breast, colon, prostate, and bladder models, with effects often coinciding with decreased galectin-3 activity or downstream signaling changes, which strengthens the translational hypothesis even if clinical confirmation remains limited [^1139nyXn] [^113LhJPD] [^114UEeb1].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully. Across the prostate trials, no grade 3–4 toxicities were reported, and adverse effects were generally mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence, with frequencies comparable to placebo in the cardiovascular RCT, which reassures me about short-term tolerability at the studied doses [^1147szj6] [^116FtaeM] [^113pH4pp]. But wait, what about special populations and interactions? I should confirm that no major drug–drug interaction signals have been reported; none are highlighted in the cited oncology literature, though standard caution about supplements with chemotherapy is prudent until better interaction data exist.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review limitations and evidence quality. The prostate data are from small, nonrandomized phase II studies without control arms, so selection bias, regression to the mean, and placebo effects cannot be excluded; durability and survival endpoints remain unproven, and the long-term 85% response figure is from conference abstracts rather than peer-reviewed publication, which tempers certainty [^111tBFDG] [^1147szj6] [^116FtaeM] [^116uoDRP]. I should also confirm that no phase III randomized trial has been completed; indeed, none are cited here, which is a critical gap for practice-changing endorsement.

> Let me translate this into practical clinical guidance. For patients with nonmetastatic biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer who are declining or deferring androgen deprivation and are interested in low-toxicity options, a monitored trial of PectaSol-C at 4.8 g three times daily away from meals for 6 months, with reassessment of PSA kinetics and imaging if clinically indicated, is reasonable within a shared decision-making framework, provided we set expectations that benefits are uncertain and evidence is preliminary [^1111FP2D] [^1147szj6] [^116FtaeM]. I should confirm that patients understand this is adjunctive and not a substitute for standard surveillance or therapy, and that any use should be coordinated with the treating oncologist or urologist.

> I will now examine broader oncologic contexts. Evidence in other solid tumors is limited to preclinical models and case series, so routine use outside prostate cancer is not supported; however, the galectin-3 rationale may justify hypothesis-generating studies in cancers with high galectin-3 expression or in settings of chemo- or immunotherapy resistance, ideally within clinical trials [^113qSQ3t] [^1139nyXn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were randomized data in bladder or breast, but I should correct that: the positive signals are preclinical, not randomized clinical trials, so clinical extrapolation remains premature [^1139nyXn] [^113LhJPD].

> But wait, what about regulatory and quality considerations? As a dietary supplement, PectaSol is not FDA-approved for cancer treatment, and product quality can vary across manufacturers; if used, I should ensure patients obtain the same formulation studied in trials and document lot information when possible to support comparability and safety tracking [^1111FP2D]. I need to ensure we also screen for potential allergens; citrus seed contamination in some pectin products can pose cross-reactivity risk for patients with cashew or pistachio allergy, so allergy history should be reviewed before initiation [^114PmYhS].

> Final synthesis: I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the totality of evidence. The biological rationale for galectin-3 inhibition is compelling, preclinical data are encouraging, and small prospective studies in biochemically relapsed prostate cancer suggest favorable PSA kinetics and good tolerability; however, the absence of randomized, controlled data and peer-reviewed confirmation of long-term outcomes means that PectaSol should not be considered standard of care and should be positioned as an investigational adjunct within shared decision-making and, when feasible, clinical trial participation [^113qSQ3t] [^1139nyXn] [^111tBFDG] [^1147szj6] [^116FtaeM] [^116uoDRP].

---

Modified citrus pectin (MCP, PectaSol) shows **modest evidence** for slowing PSA rise and may modestly improve PSA doubling time in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^111tBFDG], but **no robust evidence** supports survival, metastasis reduction, or cure [^116FtaeM]. It is generally well tolerated, with mild GI effects, and is not a substitute for standard care. Use should be **discussed with oncology** and considered adjunctive only, ideally in trials [^116uoDRP].

## Clinical evidence in cancer

### Prostate cancer

- **Phase II trial**: 13 men with biochemical recurrence after local therapy took MCP (14.4 g/day) for 12 months; 70% had increased PSA doubling time (PSADT), suggesting slower progression [^111tBFDG].

- **ASCO 2017 interim**: 34 patients; 62% had PSA stabilization/decrease at 6 months, and 79% had improved PSADT [^1147szj6].

- **ASCO 2019 primary**: 53 patients; 20% had grade 1 toxicity, and 62% had PSA stabilization/decrease at 6 months [^116FtaeM].

- **ASCO 2023 long-term**: 59 patients; 85% had long-term PSA stabilization or PSADT improvement after 18 months, with no grade 3/4 toxicity [^116uoDRP].

---

### Other cancers

Evidence in other cancers is **limited to preclinical or very early clinical data**, with no definitive human outcomes:

- **Breast cancer**: Preclinical models show reduced growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis via galectin-3 inhibition [^1111FP2D].

- **Colon cancer**: Animal data suggest reduced metastasis with MCP [^1111FP2D].

- **Multiple myeloma**: GCS-100 (a pectin derivative) induced apoptosis in vitro, but human data are lacking [^114UEeb1].

---

## Mechanisms of action

MCP's anticancer effects are **thought to be mediated** through several mechanisms:

- **Galectin-3 inhibition**: MCP binds galectin-3, reducing cell adhesion, aggregation, and metastasis [^1111FP2D].

- **Immune modulation**: May enhance T-cell mediated immunity by blocking galectin-3–mediated T-cell suppression [^1175RkQ1].

- **Metabolic effects**: May lower insulin/IGF-1 signaling, potentially slowing tumor growth [^115EnG7w].

---

## Safety and tolerability

MCP is **generally well tolerated**; mild gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea, bloating, gas) are most common and usually self-limited. No significant organ toxicity or serious adverse events have been reported in clinical studies to date [^113pH4pp].

---

## Limitations and gaps in evidence

- **Small studies**: Trials are small, uncontrolled, and often industry-sponsored; larger RCTs are needed [^116uoDRP].

- **Surrogate endpoints**: PSA kinetics are used, but survival and metastasis data are lacking [^116FtaeM].

- **Standardization**: Product variability and lack of standardized dosing complicate interpretation [^112Wh98U].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert opinions

No major oncology guideline **recommends MCP** as standard care. Experts advise it only as an adjunct within clinical trials or with close oncologist supervision, given limited evidence.

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing work includes larger RCTs to assess survival and metastasis, studies of MCP with radiation or immunotherapy, and efforts to define optimal dosing and duration.

---

## Practical considerations for patients

- **Consultation**: Discuss with the oncology team before starting MCP.

- **Adjunctive use**: Use only alongside standard care, not as a replacement.

- **Monitoring**: Track PSA and symptoms during use.

- **Quality**: Choose reputable brands with third-party testing.

---

Modified citrus pectin (PectaSol) has **modest evidence** for slowing PSA rise in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, but **no proven impact on survival or metastasis**. It is generally safe and may be considered adjunctive in select patients, ideally within clinical trials.

### Modified citrus pectin (MCP) increases the prostate-specific antigen doubling time in men with prostate cancer: a phase II pilot study [^111tBFDG]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

This trial investigated the tolerability and effect of modified citrus pectin (Pecta-Sol) in 13 men with prostate cancer and biochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after localized treatment, that is, radical prostatectomy, radiation, or cryosurgery. A total of 13 men were evaluated for tolerability and 10 for efficacy. Changes in the prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) of the 10 men were the primary end point in the study. We found that the PSADT increased (P-value < 0.05) in seven (70%) of 10 men after taking MCP for 12 months compared to before taking MCP. This study suggests that MCP may lengthen the PSADT in men with recurrent prostate cancer.

### How do tumours outside the gastrointestinal tract respond to dietary fibre supplementation? [^115EnG7w]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances in treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The role of the gut microbiota in human health and disease, particularly in relation to cancer incidence and treatment response, has gained increasing attention. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary fibre, including prebiotics, can modulate the gut microbiota and influence antitumour effects. In this review, we provide an overview of how dietary fibre impacts the gut–tumour axis through immune and non-immune mechanisms. Preclinical evidence shows that β-glucan or inulin effectively suppress extraintestinal tumour growth via immunomodulation. Other fibres such as resistant starch, modified citrus pectin and rye bran may confer antitumour effects through metabolic regulation, production of metabolites or downregulation of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 axis. Additionally, we highlight the potential for dietary fibre to modify the response to immunotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as shown by inulin increasing the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which have been associated with enhanced immunotherapy outcomes, particularly in melanoma-bearing mice. Furthermore, certain types of dietary fibre, such as psyllium, partially hydrolysed guar gum, hydrolysed rice bran and inulin plus fructooligosaccharide, have been shown to mitigate gastrointestinal toxicities in patients with cancer undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Despite the proven benefits, it is noteworthy that most adults do not consume enough dietary fibre, underscoring the importance of promoting dietary fibre supplementation in patients with cancer to optimise their treatment responses.

### Challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of nutraceuticals in cardiovascular diseases [^116WSP2k]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Food supplements that provide putative physiologic benefits, broadly termed "nutraceuticals", have long intertwined with the history of medicine. Many of the most used cardiovascular drugs today, including aspirin, digoxin, and statins, were identified from dietary food sources that were historically used as natural treatments for a broad number of aliments. The market for nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals is huge, with over $120 billion USD in global sales in 2019. Although the health benefits of nutraceuticals are widely touted by enthusiasts, hard data from rigorously conducted trials supporting improvement in clinically relevant outcomes are scarce.

Pectins are abundant and complex components of the primary plant cell wall and are well known as dietary fiber. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) is a complex water-soluble polysaccharide derived from citrus fruits, specifically the pulp and peel. Emerging evidence suggests that MCP has antineoplastic potential and is now being investigated for therapeutic benefit in a variety of cancers. Although MCP likely has pleotropic mechanisms of actions, its key physiologic impact appears to be in targeting and inhibiting the galectin-3 (Gal-3) binding pathway. Gal-3 is a member of the β-galactoside binding lectin family, which is expressed in cardiac (and other) cells and has emerged as a potential regulator of physiological and pathological processes including inflammation and fibrosis. Gal-3 has demonstrated prognostic value in predicting incident heart failure (HF) and recurrent HF. Therefore, MCP-mediated inhibition of Gal-3 represents a possible strategy for both HF prevention and for treatment of established HF.

### Galectin-3 inhibition with modified citrus pectin in hypertension [^113UgA3N]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is an important public health concern, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 5 for both men and women at 40 years of age. HF development is often a clinically inconspicuous process, characterized by progressive cardiac remodeling that is not diagnosed until late in the disease course. Accordingly, most available therapies are implemented during the symptomatic phase of HF when extensive remodeling has already occurred with limited benefit, garnering considerable interest in treatment strategies that target individuals prior to the symptom onset. Indeed, in a prevention trial of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, treatment with enalapril was associated with a reduction in mortality that was sustained over 12 years.

Cardiac fibrosis, a pathologic phenomenon caused by numerous conditions including hypertension, ischemia, and aging, contributes to the pathophysiology of HF. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a beta-galactoside–binding lectin that plays an important role in regulating inflammation and fibrosis. Gal-3 is known to be up-regulated in a number of human fibrotic diseases, including liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and most recently, cardiac fibrosis. We and others have previously shown that elevated circulating Gal-3 levels are associated with incident HF events and mortality in the community. Most recently, we found that longitudinal changes in Gal-3 were highly predictive of HF independent of baseline Gal-3 levels. Among individuals with existing HF, Gal-3 has been approved as a prognostic biomarker of HF and the measurement of Gal-3, alone or in a multimarker strategy, may provide additional risk stratification.

Modified citrus pectin (MCP), a soluble dietary fiber found in citrus fruit, is a direct Gal-3 inhibitor that binds to the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal-3. In an animal model of acute kidney injury, MCP was shown to decrease Gal-3 expression and renal fibrosis. Although MCP has been tested in human clinical trials of solid tumors and lead intoxication, its role in attenuating cardiovascular disease has not been previously investigated. In this context, we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of MCP in patients with hypertension and elevated Gal-3 levels to test our hypothesis that direct inhibition of Gal-3 may reduce subclinical cardiac fibrosis as assessed by biomarkers of collagen metabolism, echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, and vascular stiffness.

Dietary fibre and systemic antitumour effects

Dietary fibres can either manipulate the microbiota or cause tumour suppression via other mechanisms. The anticancer effects of dietary fibre have been widely investigated in CRC, including the local tumour suppressive effects of SCFAs. High dietary fibre consumption, especially cereal fibre and whole grains, was associated with a lower risk of CRC in a systematic review.O'Keele et al showed significant beneficial changes after a 2-week dietary shift from a high-fat, low-fibre Western-style diet to a high-fibre, low-fat African-style diet. This transition led to decreased levels of proliferative and inflammatory biomarkers and an increase in faecal butyrate levels. Additionally, there was an increase in butyrate-producing gut bacteria, including Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium symbiosum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

However, there have also been reports of systemic antitumour effects of dietary fibre on extraintestinal tumours in rodents and humans (tables 1 and 2). Both immune and non-immune mediated mechanisms have been described. In some instances, metabolites from bacterial fermentation of dietary fibre mediate tumour-suppressive activity. For example, β-glucan from S. cerevisiae yeast has been shown to decrease tumour growth of prostatic adenocarcinomaand reduce metastatic melanoma in the lungs, associated with activation of monocytes, in mice. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) can also inhibit tumour growth, angiogenesis and spontaneous metastasis in a preclinical immunocompromised breast cancer model. Additionally, Taper et al found that inulin and pectin can suppress breast and liver tumour growth.

Randomized trial of Gal-3 inhibitor MCP versus placebo

A total of 68 participants met enrollment criteria and were randomized to the Gal-3 inhibitor MCP versus matching placebo treatment for a total duration of 6 months. Of randomized participants, 52 completed the final study visit: 22 in the MCP treatment group and 30 in the placebo group (Figure 1). Treatment groups were similar in age and sex (mean age 57 ± 8 years, 50% women for the MCP group; mean age 54 ± 8 years, 53% women for the placebo group), though the placebo group appeared to be heavier (body mass index 33.5 ± 6.5 kg/m² for the placebo group, 30.0 ± 5.9 kg/m² for the MCP group). Most common side effects included diarrhea (6 [27%] individuals in the MCP treatment group vs. 7 [23%] individuals in the placebo group), constipation (3 [14%] individuals in the MCP treatment group vs. 8 [27%] individuals in the placebo group), and flatulence (6 [27%] individuals in the MCP treatment group vs. 6 [20%] individuals in the placebo group). Less common side effects included nausea (1 individual in the MCP treatment group) and asthma flare (1 individual in the placebo group).

Non-immune-mediated mechanisms of extraintestinal tumour suppression by dietary fibre

Dietary fibres can impact tumours through non-immune mechanisms. Resistant starch (Hi Maize 260) has been shown to modulate the control of pancreatic cancer xenografts through regulating miRNA, affecting not only inflammatory responses but also cell migration, metastasis and synthesis of carbohydrates, glucose metabolism disorder, and ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways. In our study, a combination of psyllium and resistant starch (Hi Maize 260) delayed bladder tumour growth after irradiation and this was positively correlated to caecal isoferulic acid levels. Citrus pectin can be modified in the laboratory to improve gastrointestinal absorption (MCP).MCP decreased bladder cancer xenograft growth by reducing galectin-3 levels and inactivating the Akt signalling pathway in an immunocompromised mouse model, lowered incidence of prostate cancer lung metastases in ratsand increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in patients with prostate cancer. Notably, galectin-3 levels have been found to correlate with cancer aggressiveness and metastasis, and it is also expressed in endometrial cancer. These findings underscore the potential of dietary fibre, such as MCP, in the treatment of various extraintestinal cancers.

A preclinical study showed that consumption of rye bran and soy protein led to a decreased take rate of subcutaneous prostate tumours and a reduction in PSA secretion in nude mice, while rye and whole grain-rich diets impacted on biomarkers in low-grade prostate cancerpotentially involved in slowing disease progression (see table 2). Furthermore, a randomised controlled study confirmed that patients with prostate cancer who consumed rye whole grain and bran had significantly lower levels of plasma insulin and PSA compared with those who consumed refined wheat products with added cellulose. It is known that activation of the insulin-STAT-5 pathway can promote hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Therefore, the reduced insulin secretion by dietary fibre may lower IGF-1 levels, potentially leading to antitumour effects.

There is very limited direct evidence linking gut bacterial metabolites produced from dietary fibre to tumour suppression, with most of these findings limited to SCFAs or in vitro studies. Wei et al showed that compared with low-fibre diet, an unspecified high-fibre diet increased tumour and plasma butyrate levels and suppressed the tumour growth of subcutaneous lymphoma xenografts in mice. An indirect association was observed with dietary barley leaf supplementation, which increased gut microbiota-derived inosine levels, while Magel et al found that the bacterial metabolite inosine can promote the immunotherapy response against intestinal, bladder and melanoma cancer in mice.

Methods

Study sample

We included individuals 21 to 70 years of age with physician-diagnosed hypertension, who were on stable therapy for at least 3 months, and who had elevated Gal-3 levels. Elevated Gal-3 was defined as ≥ 50th sex-specific percentile (≥ 13.1 ng/ml in men, ≥ 14.3 ng/ml in women) as derived from normative values among participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Participants were screened from October 2013 to March 2018. Of this screening sample (n = 275), we excluded participants with nonelevated Gal-3 (n = 186), with renal dysfunction defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 ml/min/1.73 m² (n = 3), with aldosterone antagonist use (n = 1), with abnormal laboratory values (i.e. hyperkalemia, anemia) (n = 1), and who withdrew participation after initial screening (n = 16). The remaining participants (n = 68) were eligible for randomization and subsequent follow-up as outlined subsequently. The study was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University Medical Center. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards.

Study procedures and ascertainment of outcomes

We randomly assigned 68 participants in double-blind fashion to receive either active MCP or matching placebo at a dose of 4.8 g thrice daily for 6 months in a 1:1 ratio. MCP and matching placebo were provided by EcoNugenics (Pectasol-C, Santa Rosa, California) (Figure 1). Randomization was done separately for men and women and was performed in blocks of 4 to assure balanced sex representation and group sizes. Investigators and participants were blinded to study assignment.

### The effects of different dietary fiber pectin structures on the gastrointestinal immune barrier: impact via gut microbiota and direct effects on immune cells [^1175RkQ1]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Interaction of pectin with pattern recognition receptors

Innate immune cells can recognize dietary fibers through interaction with extracellular PRRs. PRRs function as sensors that recognize molecular patterns from microbes, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PRRs are expressed by innate immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and epithelial cells. Molecules derived from damaged cells are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PRRs play an important role in initiating innate immune responses. In recent years, many studies have reported that PRRs interact with dietary fibers –. Pectins are known to affect immune responses through interactions with the PRRs galectins and Toll-like receptors.

Pectin has been reported to bind to Galectin-3. Galectin-3 is expressed extracellularly or intracellularly by different cell types and plays a role in health and disease. Extracellular Galectin-3 is known to interact with carbohydrates, but intracellular Galectin-3 is considered to bind to intracellular proteins. The effects of pectins on Galectin-3 are suggested to initially occur via extracellular Galectin-3. However, as pectin and Galectin-3 can be endocytosed by macrophages, pectins may also affect intracellular pathways by binding to Galectin-3. The binding of pectins to Galectin-3 is established through the interaction between the lectin domain of Galectin-3 and galactose residues or arabinan side chains of RG-I and RG-II pectins. By binding to Galectin-3, pectins can stimulate immunity against cancer cells. Cancer cells express Galectin-3, limiting T-cell mediated immunity against cancer cells. Galectin-3 binds to T-cells, leading to inhibition of T cell responses or apoptosis. By binding to Galectin-3, pectins block the inhibition of T-cell mediated immunity against cancer cells and can therefore be used in anticancer therapy. In addition to cancer cells, Galectin-3 is expressed on immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, DCs, neutrophils and epithelial cells. These immune cells use Galectin-3 as a PRR to induce innate immune responses against pathogens. Pectins might enhance these responses by binding to Galectin-3. Thus, RG-I and RG-II pectins with galactose or arabinan structures can bind to Galectin-3, and pectins might exert anti-metastatic or anti-pathogenic effects through this interaction –.

### Pleiotropic regulatory mechanisms and targeted therapeutic prospects of galectin-3 in aging-related diseases [^117QcAjb]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aging is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), atherosclerosis (AS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), osteoarthritis (OA) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a unique β-galactoside-binding lectin, has emerged as a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of AD and other age-related disorders by modulating key mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While emphasizing neurological disorders (AD, PD), this review also examines Gal-3's role in systemic age-related conditions (T2DM, AS, OA, AMD) that frequently co-occur with or influence neurodegeneration. This review summarizes current knowledge on the expression patterns, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of Gal-3 in aging-related diseases. Elevated Gal-3 levels have been detected in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, where it contributes to multiple pathological processes, including microglia-driven neuroinflammation, Aβ plaque deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, Gal-3 upregulation is observed across various age-related diseases and correlates with disease progression, underscoring its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Preclinical studies demonstrate that Gal-3-targeted interventions-including small-molecule inhibitors (e.g. TD-139), natural compounds (e.g., modified citrus pectin), and other pharmacological agents-exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects by binding to Gal-3 and modulating its activity in animal models, offering promising avenues for multi-disease treatment. However, the dual roles and complex regulatory networks of Gal-3 present challenges for clinical translation, requiring context-specific therapeutic approaches tailored to distinct disease mechanisms. Future research should focus on elucidating tissue-specific mechanisms and optimizing combination therapies to enable precise targeting of aging-related pathologies.

### Galectin-3 inhibition with modified citrus pectin in hypertension [^112cWYYT]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

We investigated the effect of galectin-3 (Gal-3) inhibition with modified citrus pectin on markers of collagen metabolism in a proof-of-concept randomized placebo-controlled trial of participants with elevated Gal-3 levels and hypertension. Although higher Gal-3 levels were associated with female sex, diabetes, and reduced glomerular filtration rate in cross-sectional analyses, treatment with modified citrus pectin did not change collagen markers. The effect of Gal-3 inhibition among individuals with heart failure warrants further investigation.

### A novel carbohydrate-based therapeutic GCS-100 overcomes bortezomib resistance and enhances dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells [^114UEeb1]. Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Human multiple myeloma is a presently incurable hematologic malignancy, and novel biologically based therapies are urgently needed. GCS-100 is a polysaccharide derived from citrus pectin in clinical development for the treatment of cancer. Here we show that GCS-100 induces apoptosis in various multiple myeloma cell lines, including those resistant to dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin. Examination of purified patient multiple myeloma cells showed similar results. Specifically, GCS-100 decreases viability of bortezomib/PS-341-resistant multiple myeloma patient cells. Importantly, GCS-100 inhibits multiple myeloma cell growth induced by adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells; overcome the growth advantage conferred by antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, heat shock protein-27, and nuclear factor-kappaB; and blocks vascular endothelial growth factor-induced migration of multiple myeloma cells. GCS-100-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 followed by proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme. Combined with dexamethasone, GCS-100 induces additive anti-multiple myeloma cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial apoptotic signaling via release of cytochrome c and Smac followed by activation of caspase-3. Moreover, GCS-100 + dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells is accompanied by a marked inhibition of an antiapoptotic protein Galectin-3, without significant alteration in Bcl-2 expression. Collectively, these findings provide the framework for clinical evaluation of GCS-100, either alone or in combination with dexamethasone, to inhibit tumor growth, overcome drug resistance, and improve outcome for patients with this universally fatal hematologic malignancy.

Conclusions

In summary, we present the results of the first proof-of-concept interventional trial of Gal-3 inhibition for the attenuation of cardiac fibrosis in human subjects. We demonstrate higher baseline Gal-3 levels in women compared with men and further validate previous associations of Gal-3 with clinical risk factors including diabetes and reduced eGFR. Gal-3 inhibition via MCP did not influence surrogate measures of cardiac fibrosis, including collagen turnover markers, echocardiographic measures, and vascular function in human subjects at risk for HF. Whether Gal-3 inhibition among individuals with existing HF may meaningfully attenuate cardiac fibrosis and, ultimately, clinical cardiovascular events remains to be studied.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In the first proof-of-concept interventional trial of Gal-3 inhibition in human subjects with hypertension, Gal-3 inhibition with MCP did not influence collagen markers, echocardiographic measures, or vascular function. However, we showed that baseline Gal-3 levels were higher in women compared with men and confirmed previous associations of Gal-3 with diabetes and reduced eGFR.

### Galectin-3 in septic acute kidney injury: a translational study [^113DFo23]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Cecal ligation and puncture model

CLP was performed with a predetermined 25% ligated length of cecum. Following ligation, the cecum was punctured twice using a 20-gauge needle inferior to the ileocecal valve. The abdomen was then closed and 20 ml/kg of prewarmed saline was administered subcutaneously as fluid resuscitation. Rats were returned to their cages and allowed food and water ad libitum.

Animal experimental protocol

The animal study included three groups (Fig. 1). All rat groups underwent CLP. Two intervention groups were administered low molecular weight modified citrus pectin (P-MCP) (PectaSol-C ®, EcoNugenics, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) in drinking water for seven days prior to CLP. P-MCP is a dietary supplement comprised of low molecular weight pectin, which directly inhibits Gal-3 by binding to the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal-3. The pectin is derived from the pith of citrus peels, after which it is enzymatically treated to yield pectin fibers with a molecular weight less than 15 kDa and less than 5% esterification. The effect of P-MCP has been validated in multiple animal models of AKI.

Fig. 1
CLP experimental strategy. All rats underwent CLP. Control group (n = 18) received normal drinking water, while two intervention groups received a Gal-3 inhibitor, PMCP, at 400 mg/kg/d and 1200 mg/kg/d 7 d prior to CLP. Following CLP, blood was drawn at baseline, 2, 8, and 24 h post-CLP for serum biochemical measurements

The first intervention group (n = 18) received P-MCP at 400 mg/kg/day, while the second intervention group (n = 18) received P-MCP at 1200 mg/kg/day. The control group (n = 18) was not provided with P-MCP prior to CLP and received water ad libitum. P-MCP was not provided to any group following the CLP procedure.

Echocardiography

Participants underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography including 2-dimensional pulsed wave and tissue Doppler echocardiography using Vivid 7 and Vivid IQ ultrasonography systems (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at baseline and final examinations. Standard measurements included cardiac dimensions, LV ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and diastolic function assessment as previously described. LV mass was calculated as follows: 0.8 × (1.04 × [(LV end-diastolic dimension + LV posterior wall thickness + LV septal wall thickness)³ − (LV end-diastolic dimension)³]) + 0.6. Speckle tracking–based analyses of LV global longitudinal strain were performed offline with excellent reproducibility as previously described (2D Cardiac Performance Analysis v1.1, TomTec Imaging Systems; Unterschleißheim, Germany). Primary measures obtained included global longitudinal strain of the apical 2- and 4-chamber views. Echocardiography images were analyzed by observers blinded to participant treatment randomization, and measurements were made in triplicate and averaged whenever possible. The interobserver within-subject coefficients of variation for longitudinal strain measures ranged from 3.0% to 4.0%.

### Cancer chemoprevention: lessons learned and future directions [^111aYxxo]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Diet modification

Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, specifically diets rich in citrus fruits, dark green vegetables, and cruciferous vegetables, reduce risk of cancer. Recent data document success in diet modification using extensive prepared materials, staff effort, intensive intervention with the targeted population over a 1-year or 4-year period. Diet can be modified in medically well-served and medically underserved populations. The entire diet can be modified to enhance fruit and vegetable intake. Dietary interventions utilising motivational interviewing performed by minimally trained lay members of a community can successfully disseminate cancer protective diets to large populations at minimal cost.

A prospective, 4-year diet modification trial failed to reduce adenoma recurrence. Similarly, an intervention with fibre also failed to reduce colorectal adenoma recurrence The former trial was criticised because the serum biomarker of diet modification, serum carotenoids, did not change in the treated group while the dose and type of fibre used was criticised in the later trial. The ongoing WHEL project tests the question of dietary modulation impact upon cancer preventive and treatment efficacy in a population of women with early-stage breast cancer. The tools and procedures necessary to effect a dietary change in a large population (thousands) are available at reasonable cost. While attempts to modify human carcinogenesis with diet modification to date have been disappointing, the effects of these interventions may require much longer term follow-up (beyond 4 years). Alternatively, intervention prior to the appearance of a late carcinogenesis neoplastic event, such as a dysplastic lesion, in individuals with low-penetrance, high-frequency genetic haplotypes predictive for increased risk of an epithelial cancer may be required to demonstrate cancer preventive efficacy. Given the low toxicity, low cost, and relative ease of implementation, diet modification should be considered as a preferred preventive intervention in the healthy but a higher than normal risk population.

Clinical variables and collagen biomarkers

Medical history, physical examination, and fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline examination prior to randomization and again at final examination after 6 months of medication treatment. Blood serum was separated, aliquoted, and stored at –80°C for further processing. Serum levels of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) (EIA MicroVue CICP, Quidel Corporation, San Diego, California), N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) (RIA, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland), N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CITP) (RIA, Orion Diagnostica), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 (alphaLISA, PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts) were measured at a core laboratory. Assay performance characteristics are summarized in Supplemental Table 1. Measures of renal function (i.e. eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatine ratio) were obtained from fasting blood and urine samples at baseline and final examinations.

Arterial tonometry methods

Supine measurements of arterial stiffness were noninvasively assessed using applanation tonometry or volumetric displacement of the brachial artery using a cuff-based system (SphygmoCor XCEL or SphygmoCor CvMS, AtCor Medical, Naperville, Illinois) at baseline and final examinations. Central aortic pressure was derived using a generalized transfer function applied to pressure tracings. Pulsed wave analysis included ascertainment of augmentation pressure (AP) (mm Hg) defined as the pressure the reflected wave contributes to systolic blood pressure, augmentation index (AIx) defined as ratio of AP to pulse pressure, and AIx normalized to a heart rate of 75 beats/min. Carotid-femoral pulsed wave velocity (PWV) (m/s) was obtained using electrocardiography-gated pulse waveforms or cuff measurements. Pressure tracing and waveform quality control metrics were applied including pre-specified operator index or variability metrics. Intraobserver reproducibility measurements were performed on 16 randomly selected subjects, who underwent 2 separate pulsed wave analysis measurements on the same day. The intraclass correlation coefficient for reported outcome variables was excellent and ranged between 93% and 94%.

Effect of Gal-3 inhibition on collagen markers

In the primary trial analyses, levels of the collagen metabolism marker PIIINP increased by 0.15 log-transformed units (p = 0.02) after 6 months of treatment with MCP compared with no significant change in the placebo group (p = 0.47) (Table 2, Figure 3). There was a borderline statistically significant between-group difference in the change in PIIINP levels (p = 0.05). There were no other differences comparing baseline with post-treatment collagen biomarkers (PICP, CITP, and MMP-1) after 6 months of treatment regardless of treatment assignment (Table 2).

Effect of Gal-3 inhibition on secondary endpoints

In secondary analyses, changes in Gal-3, renal function, as quantified by eGFR, creatinine, and urine albumin-to-creatine ratio, and vascular stiffness, as quantified by AP, AIx, and PWV, did not meet statistical significance in either treatment group (Table 2). Although measures of vascular stiffness in the MCP treatment group were lower at the end of the trial compared with unchanged or worse measures in the placebo arm, none of these differences were statistically significant. Echocardiographic parameters of cardiac structure and function are summarized in Table 2. LV mass index was lower after 6 months of MCP therapy (difference = –5.47 g/m², SE = 2.19 g/m²; p = 0.02), with no change in the placebo group. Similarly, mitral inflow deceleration time increased by 21 ms (difference = 21.38 ms, SE = 8.71 ms; p = 0.02) in the MCP group without significant change in the placebo group. Between-group differences, however, were not significant. Other measures of diastolic function, including mitral E/e′ ratio, as well as cardiac mechanics as measured by global longitudinal strain did not change in either treatment group.

### Prebiotic selection influencing inflammatory bowel disease treatment outcomes: a review of the preclinical and clinical evidence [^1131EwLj]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

A small explorative study evaluated the effects of XOS on the faecal microbiota of five UC remission patients. Using an in vitro culture medium supplemented with 0.8 g/L of XOS, the study used a fermentation chamber seeded with samples from patients with UC and healthy patient faecal samples to simulate GI conditions. The results indicated a significant increase in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera when exposed to XOS. These genera, well-regarded for their beneficial properties such as butyrate production and immune modulation, underscore the potential capability of XOS in modulating the gut microbiota. Crucially, other clinical studies offer differing perspectives on the benefits of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera in active IBD phases. Despite this, the benefits of XOS are limited by insufficient evidence in clinical IBD studies.

Pectin

Pectin is a complex polysaccharide abundantly present primarily in the pith of citrus fruits, with lesser amounts found in a variety of other fruits and vegetables. The structure of pectin consists of α−1,4-linked D-galacturonic acid residues, varying in esterification levels depending on the plant species, thereby influencing its effects on fermentation, SCFA production and immune modulation. Two key preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficacy of pectin in animal models of colitis. For instance, a 17-day study evaluating the side chain content of pectin (5% of orange of citrus pectin w/w of diet) on colitis-induced mice found that a high side chain content pectin (orange pectin) ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis. These findings support the structure specificity of pectin as an anti-colitis agent, as low side chain content (citrus pectin) did not modulate disease outcomes in the study. Similarly, in a 21-day study using DSS-induced colitis in mice, orange pectin (200 mg/kg of bodyweight/day) led to a reduction in disease activity, protection against TNBS-induced colonic length reduction and tissue damage.

Statistical analysis

Baseline clinical characteristics are presented by study group assignment as mean ± SD or percentages. Non-normally distributed variables including biomarkers were natural log-transformed due to right-skewed distributions. Galectin-3 values were standardized.

In cross-sectional analyses, we examined the association of Gal-3 with clinical characteristics, arterial stiffness, and renal function among all participants who attended the screening visit (n = 275). We applied a log-normal generalized linear model for continuous outcomes and a logistic model for dichotomous outcomes. We adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and eGFR for cross-sectional analyses and further adjusted for heart rate in analyses of arterial tonometry measures.

A total of 52 individuals had complete biomarker data at baseline and 6-month follow-up and were included in primary analyses. We examined changes in log-transformed collagen metabolism biomarkers (PICP, PIIINP, CITP, MMP-1, and CITP:MMP-1 ratio) between baseline and final examination in both MCP and placebo treatment groups using paired Student's t -tests. The change from baseline was compared between MCP and placebo groups using unpaired Student's t -tests. In secondary analyses, we used paired Student's t -tests to examine changes in Gal-3, renal function, vascular stiffness, and echocardiographic measures of strain, elastance, and diastolic function in both treatment groups. Group differences were also assessed using unpaired t tests.

For primary analyses comparing between-group differences of collagen biomarkers between MCP and placebo treatment groups, we used a Bonferroni-corrected p value threshold of p = 0.0125 (0.05/4 collagen biomarkers). All other analyses were exploratory and considered statistically significant at a 2-sided p value < 0.05. Data analyses were completed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina), R version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and RStudio version 1.2.5001 (RStudio, Boston, Massachusetts).

### Cholesterol-lowering properties of different pectin types in mildly hyper-cholesterolemic men and women [^115WGoR6]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Viscous fibers typically reduce total cholesterol (TC) by 3–7% in humans. The cholesterol-lowering properties of the viscous fiber pectin may depend on its physico-chemical properties (viscosity, molecular weight (MW) and degree of esterification (DE)), but these are not typically described in publications, nor required by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with respect to its generic pectin cholesterol-lowering claim.

Subjects/Methods

Here, different sources and types of well-characterized pectin were evaluated in humans. Cross-over studies were completed in mildly hyper-cholesterolemic persons receiving either 15 g/day pectin or cellulose with food for 4 weeks.

Results

Relative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering was as follows: citrus pectin DE-70 = apple pectin DE-70 (7–10% reduction versus control) > apple pectin DE-35 = citrus pectin DE-35 > OPF (orange pulp fiber) DE-70 and low-MW pectin DE-70 > citrus DE-0. In a subsequent 3-week trial with 6 g/day pectin, citrus DE-70 and high MW pectin DE-70 reduced LDL-C 6–7% versus control (without changes in TC). In both studies, high DE and high MW were important for cholesterol lowering. Source may also be important as citrus and apple DE-70 pectin were more effective than OPF DE-70 pectin. Pectin did not affect inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) nor plasma homocysteine.

Conclusions

Pectin source and type (DE and MW) affect cholesterol lowering. The EFSA pectin cholesterol-lowering claim should require a minimum level of characterization, including DE and MW.

### Galectin-3 is a sensor-regulator of toll-like receptor pathways in synovial fibroblasts [^112HdGtY]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding lectin that plays an important role in the modulation of immune responses. It has been shown to aggravate joint inflammation and destruction in experimental arthritis. We investigated the role of galectin-3 in TLR-induced cell activation in human synovial fibroblasts (SF) in order to better understand the mechanism(s) of the proinflammatory function of galectin-3 in arthritis. Galectin-3 expression in SF obtained from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients was inhibited by siRNA mediated gene-knockdown. Galectin-3 was also inhibited with modified citrus pectin (MCP), a polysaccharide galectin-3 ligand. Galectin-3 knockdown inhibited TLR-2, -3 and -4-induced IL-6 secretion, but not TLR-2, -3 and -4-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-3 or CC chemokine ligand-5 secretion. When the SF were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator that bypasses the membranal receptors, galectin-3 knockdown no longer influenced IL-6 secretion. MCP reduced IL-6 levels in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that galectin-3 is a positive sensor-regulator of TLR-induced IL-6 secretion in human synovial fibroblasts, thus adding new insights into the mechanisms by which galectin-3 augments synovial inflammation. These findings corroborate the potential role of glycan inhibitors of galectin-3 as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis.

### The kidney, bone marrow, and heart connection in acute kidney injury: role of galecin-3 [^1168Wjzz]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Prud'homme et al.report that experimental acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice induces remote cardiac injury through the upregulation of a novel mediator galectin-3 (Gal-3). The major findings are that acute (up to 72 h) ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI in mice stimulated an increase in Gal-3 expression in tubular inflammatory cells in the kidney and in cardiac tissues, with an increase in circulating levels of Gal-3. Along this line, ischemia/reperfusion also stimulated macrophage infiltration (CD68 + cells) and an increase in plasma proinflammatory cytokines. With Gal-3 disruption (Gal-3 knockout [KO]), ischemia/reperfusion in KO mice abrogated the inflammatory response supported by decreases in cardiac CD68 + cells and cytokines levels. Long-term (1-month) ischemia/reperfusion upregulated Gal-3 expression and induced cardiac injury and dysfunction with myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, decrease of fractional shortening, and an increase of left ventricular diastolic diameter. Gal-3 blockade with Gal-3 KO or pharmaceutical inhibition by modified citrus pectin significantly attenuated these abnormal myocardial events. The modified citrus pectin effect was confirmed in a second long-term (up to 2 months) model of kidney injury induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, in which the obstruction increased Gal-3, inflammation, and fibrosis, and reduced fractional shortening. This second model was a rigorous test of the hypothesis of Prudhomme et al.that the kidney communicates with the heart via Gal-3.

### The effects of different dietary fiber pectin structures on the gastrointestinal immune barrier: impact via gut microbiota and direct effects on immune cells [^112Wh98U]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Diet-derived microbial metabolites.

Intestinal microbiota can secrete diet-derived metabolites, which can potentially activate the immune system through Ahr, GPRs or GPBAR1. Ahr Aryl hydrogen receptor, BCFA branched chain fatty acid, GPBAR1 G protein–coupled bile acid receptor 1, GPR G-protein-coupled receptor, SCFA short-chain fatty acids, TMA trimethylamine, TMAO trimethylamine N-oxide.

The soluble dietary fiber pectin is an important dietary fiber with known modulatory effects on the gastrointestinal immune barrier. Pectins have been isolated from the primary and secondary cell walls of many fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits, apples, sugar beets, and potatoes. They mainly consist of linear 1,4-D-galacturonan (homogalacturonan) segments and branched rhamnogalacturonan segments. Pectins can have many different structural characteristics contributing to their functional properties, including the degree of methyl-esterification, molecular weight or neutral side chain structures. Several studies involving animal models and human subjects have shown that pectins protect the intestinal barrier from damage –. These effects may be exerted by direct interactions with the gastrointestinal immune barrier, as some types of pectins are known to interact with immune receptors. Furthermore, pectins may protect the intestinal barrier indirectly by stimulating the growth and diversity of microbiota communities as pectins are known to stimulate microbial communities. These effects are strongly dependent on the chemical structure of pectins –. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the impact of specific structural features of pectins on their health benefits to consumers. The main aim of this review article was to overview the current knowledge of the modulatory properties of specific chemical structures of pectins and their beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal immune barrier; for example, for a dietary fiber that might be instrumental in preventing many Western diseases. We will focus on pectin structures that influence the immune system by direct effects on immune cells or by indirectly interacting with the immune system by modulating intestinal microbial communities and the metabolites they produce. This article may provide insight into the structural features responsible for intestinal health benefits. Ultimately, this might lead to tailoring of pectin formulation or products that might contribute to prevention or delay of human disease development.

### Galectin-3 in septic acute kidney injury: a translational study [^116Beqe8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a pleiotropic glycan-binding protein shown to be involved in sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its role has never been elucidated in sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI). We aimed to explore Gal-3's role and its potential utility as a therapeutic target in S-AKI.

Methods

In 57 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis, serum Gal-3 was examined as a predictor of ICU mortality and development of AKI. In a rat model of S-AKI induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), 7-day mortality and serum Gal-3, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and creatinine were examined at 2, 8, and 24 hours (h) post-CLP. Two experimental groups received the Gal-3 inhibitor modified citrus pectin (P-MCP) at 400 mg/kg/day and 1200 mg/kg/day, while the control group received water only (n = 18 in each group).

Results

Among 57 patients, 27 developed AKI and 8 died in the ICU. Serum Gal-3 was an independent predictor of AKI (OR = 1.2 [95% CI 1.1–1.4], p = 0.01) and ICU mortality (OR = 1.4 [95% CI 1.1–2.2], p = 0.04) before and after controlling for age, AKI, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score. In the CLP rat experiment, serum Gal-3 peaked earlier than IL-6. Serum Gal-3 was significantly lower in both P-MCP groups compared to control at 2 h post-CLP (400 mg: p = 0.003; 1200 mg: p = 0.002), and IL-6 was significantly lower in both P-MCP groups at all time points with a maximum difference at 24 h post-CLP (400 mg: p = 0.015; 1200 mg: p = 0.02). In the Gal-3 inhibitor groups, 7-day mortality was significantly reduced from 61% in the control group to 28% (400 mg P-MCP: p = 0.03) and 22% (1200 mg P-MCP: p = 0.001). Rates of AKI per RIFLE criteria were significantly reduced from 89% in the control group to 44% in both P-MCP groups (400 mg: p = 0.007; 1200 mg: p = 0.007).

Conclusions

This translational study demonstrates the importance of Gal-3 in the pathogenesis of S-AKI, and its potential utility as a therapeutic target.

### The effects of different dietary fiber pectin structures on the gastrointestinal immune barrier: impact via gut microbiota and direct effects on immune cells [^115bahd2]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Structural characteristics of pectin molecules.

A pectin molecule can contain different structural characteristics, including homogalacturonan, xylogalacturonan, apiogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I, and rhamnogalacturonan II.

In addition to homogalacturonan regions, pectins can contain other structural regions, such as xylogalacturonan, apiogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) or rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Fig. 2). Xylogalacturonan regions are homogalacturonan structures substituted with xylose molecules. Apiogalacturonan regions are homogalacturonan structures with attached monosaccharide or disaccharide apioduranosyl. RG-I regions are based on disaccharide backbone structures of alternating galacturonic acid and rhamnose residues. The rhamnose residues in RG-I can be branched with neutral side chains consisting of galactose or arabinose. The GalA residues of RG-I are mostly non-methyl esterified. RG-II regions contain a different backbone than RG-I regions and consist of only galacturonic acid residues. RG-II molecules have complex pectin structures that may comprise up to 12 different branched sugar residues. These sugar molecules can be linked by 21 different glycosidic linkages, making RG-II molecules very complex. Pectins containing regions with such a high number of neutral side chains have been isolated from many fruits and vegetables, including apples, sugar beets, apricots, carrots, cabbage, onions or pears.

### Lycopene inhibits DNA synthesis in primary prostate epithelial cells in vitro and its administration is associated with a reduced prostate-specific antigen velocity in a phase II clinical study [^112sJnth]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Interest in lycopene has focused primarily on its use in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer (CaP); there are few clinical trials involving men with established disease. In addition, most data examining its mechanism of action have been obtained from experiments using immortal cell lines. We report the inhibitory effect(s) of lycopene in primary prostate epithelial cell (PEC) cultures, and the results of a pilot phase II clinical study investigating whole-tomato lycopene supplementation on the behavior of established CaP, demonstrating a significant and maintained effect on prostate-specific antigen velocity over 1 year. These data reinforce the justification for a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

### The impact of galectin-3 inhibition on aldosterone-induced cardiac and renal injuries [^115DE851]. JACC: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated whether galectin (Gal)-3 inhibition could block aldosterone-induced cardiac and renal fibrosis and improve cardiorenal dysfunction.

Background

Aldosterone is involved in cardiac and renal fibrosis that is associated with the development of cardiorenal injury. However, the mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. Gal-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, is increased in heart failure and kidney injury.

Methods

Rats were treated with aldosterone-salt combined with spironolactone (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) or modified citrus pectin (a Gal-3 inhibitor), for 3 weeks. Wild-type and Gal-3 knockout mice were treated with aldosterone for 3 weeks. Hemodynamic, cardiac, and renal parameters were analyzed.

Results

Hypertensive aldosterone-salt-treated rats presented cardiac and renal hypertrophy (at morphometric, cellular, and molecular levels) and dysfunction. Cardiac and renal expressions of Gal-3 as well as levels of molecular markers attesting fibrosis were also augmented by aldosterone-salt treatment. Spironolactone or modified citrus pectin treatment reversed all of these effects. In wild-type mice, aldosterone did not alter blood pressure levels but increased cardiac and renal Gal-3 expression, fibrosis, and renal epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Gal-3 knockout mice were resistant to aldosterone effects.

Conclusions

In experimental hyperaldosteronism, the increase in Gal-3 expression was associated with cardiac and renal fibrosis and dysfunction but was prevented by pharmacological inhibition (modified citrus pectin) or genetic disruption of Gal-3. These data suggest a key role for Gal-3 in cardiorenal remodeling and dysfunction induced by aldosterone. Gal-3 could be used as a new biotarget for specific pharmacological interventions.

### Galectin-3 inhibition prevents adipose tissue remodelling in obesity [^112sJzY7]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Extracellular matrix remodelling of the adipose tissue has a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is increased in obesity and mediates inflammation and fibrosis in the cardiovascular system. However, the effects of Gal-3 on adipose tissue remodelling associated with obesity remain unclear. Male Wistar rats were fed either a high-fat diet (33.5% fat) or a standard diet (3.5% fat) for 6 weeks. Half of the animals of each group were treated with the pharmacological inhibitor of Gal-3, modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100mgkg⁻¹ per day) in the drinking water. In adipose tissue, obese animals presented an increase in Gal-3 levels that were accompanied by an increase in pericellular collagen. Obese rats exhibited higher adipose tissue inflammation, as well as enhanced differentiation degree of the adipocytes. Treatment with MCP prevented all the above effects. In mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Gal-3 (10⁻⁸ m) treatment increased fibrosis, inflammatory and differentiation markers. In conclusion, Gal-3 emerges as a potential therapeutic target in adipose tissue remodelling associated with obesity and could have an important role in the development of metabolic alterations associated with obesity.

### Galectin-3 blockade inhibits cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in experimental hyperaldosteronism and hypertension [^117P3Z8A]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertensive cardiac remodeling is accompanied by molecular inflammation and fibrosis, 2 mechanisms that finally affect cardiac function. At cardiac level, aldosterone promotes inflammation and fibrosis, although the precise mechanisms are still unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding lectin, is associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the cardiovascular system. We herein investigated whether Gal-3 inhibition could block aldosterone-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and its potential role in cardiac damage associated with hypertension. Aldosterone-salt-treated rats presented hypertension, cardiac inflammation, and fibrosis that were prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of Gal-3 with modified citrus pectin. Cardiac inflammation and fibrosis presented in spontaneously hypertensive rats were prevented by modified citrus pectin treatment, whereas Gal-3 blockade did not modify blood pressure levels. In the absence of blood pressure modifications, Gal-3 knockout mice were resistant to aldosterone-induced cardiac inflammation. In human cardiac fibroblasts, aldosterone increased Gal-3 expression via its mineralocorticoid receptor. Gal-3 and aldosterone enhanced proinflammatory and profibrotic markers, as well as metalloproteinase activities in human cardiac fibroblasts, effects that were not observed in Gal-3-silenced cells treated with aldosterone. In experimental hyperaldosteronism, the increase in Gal-3 expression was associated with cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, alterations that were prevented by Gal-3 blockade independently of blood pressure levels. These data suggest that Gal-3 could be a new molecular mechanism linking cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in situations with high-aldosterone levels, such as hypertension.

### Galectin-3 mediates aldosterone-induced vascular fibrosis [^112mkF74]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Aldosterone (Aldo) is involved in arterial stiffness and heart failure, but the mechanisms have remained unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding lectin, plays an important role in inflammation, fibrosis, and heart failure. We investigated here whether Gal-3 is involved in Aldo-induced vascular fibrosis.

Methods and Results

In rat vascular smooth muscle cells Gal-3 overexpression enhanced specifically collagen type I synthesis. Moreover Gal-3 inhibition by modified citrus pectin or small interfering RNA blocked Aldo-induced collagen type I synthesis. Rats were treated with Aldo-salt combined with spironolactone or modified citrus pectin for 3 weeks. Hypertensive Aldo-treated rats presented vascular hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and increased aortic Gal-3 expression. Spironolactone or modified citrus pectin treatment reversed all the above effects. Wild-type and Gal-3 knock-out mice were treated with Aldo for 6 hours or 3 weeks. Aldo increased aortic Gal-3 expression, inflammation, and collagen type I in wild-type mice at both the short- and the long-term, whereas no changes occurred in Gal-3 knock-out mice.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that Gal-3 is required for inflammatory and fibrotic responses to Aldo in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a key role for Gal-3 in vascular fibrosis.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^113tiuXh]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Juicing, cleanses, and detox — claims and nutrient considerations note that fruit and vegetable juices can be a convenient way to consume beneficial, bioactive food components in vegetables and fruit and, in moderation, can be a worthwhile component of healthful dietary patterns, but juices contain less fiber, lower levels of some other beneficial nutrients, and more naturally occurring sugar than the whole fruits and vegetables they are made from and thus are not the best way to obtain nutrients from plant-based foods. Known as juice cleanses or juice detoxification, this kind of diet is promoted as a way to remove "toxins", but that claim is not supported by scientific evidence, and toxins that enter our body through the foods and beverages we consume are continually eliminated by the kidneys and liver, regardless of whether a person is consuming liquid or solid foods.

### Synergistic pectin deconstruction is a prerequisite for mutualistic interactions between honeybee gut bacteria [^11378vKA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The catalytic efficiency of pectate lyases can be affected by the level of methylation of the homogalacturonan backbone. To test whether homogalacturonan demethylation was essential for fulfilling PL functions in Gilliamella, one representative strain carrying the CGC-1 (strain W8127 of G. apicola) was cultured on two homogalacturonan substrates characterized by varied levels of methylation: citrus pectin with a high level of methylation (PC, > 55% methyl esterified) or de-methylated polygalacturonic acid (PGA, < 5% methyl esterified). The results showed that both the bacterial yield and growth rate of W8127 were substantially decreased on the heavily methylated PC substrate (Fig. 1D and E, Student's t -test, p < 0.001). We further validated whether the growth reduction was attributed to the impeded activity of PL1 on PC deconstruction. The PL1 enzyme of W8127 was heterologously expressed and purified (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B) to measure enzyme activities on PC and PGA substrates (Supplementary Fig. 2E–H). The enzymatic assay showed that the initial reaction rate and specific cleavage activity of PL1 were both significantly decreased on the PC substrate compared to PGA (Fig. 1F, Student's t -test, p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 2C and D), which explains the impeded growth of W8127 on PC. Strikingly, despite the necessary involvement of methylesterase in pectate lysis, no methylesterase was identified in any of the 189 examined Gilliamella genomes, in congruence with a previous study(Supplementary Fig. 1B). Therefore, complete homogalacturonan degradation cannot be performed by Gilliamella alone.

### Summary of presentations from the 46th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2010): focus on supportive care issues related to lung cancer [^1126ChZh]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with advanced cancer, particularly of the lung, frequently experience deteriorating physical health. Supportive care measures help ensure optimal quality of life during difficult psychologic and social situations. Research in the area of supportive care in patients with cancer should be made a priority.

Methods

This review summarizes the findings from selected supportive care studies presented at the recently concluded 46 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Discussion

Topics discussed include the use of a single dose of fosaprepitant for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, statins to lower the incidence of venous thromboembolic events, fentanyl pectin nasal spray for cancer-related pain, and a closer look at the utilization of complementary and alternative medicine in patients with cancer.

### Galectin-3 participates in cardiovascular remodeling associated with obesity [^117CtDFG]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and arterial stiffness are some of the alterations through which obesity affects the cardiovascular system. Fibrosis and inflammation are important mechanisms underlying cardiovascular remodeling, although the precise promoters involved in these processes are still unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces inflammation and fibrosis in the cardiovascular system. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in cardiac damage in morbidly obese patients, and we have evaluated the protective effect of the Gal-3 inhibition in the occurrence of cardiovascular fibrosis and inflammation in an experimental model of obesity. Morbid obesity is associated with alterations in cardiac remodeling, mainly left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Obesity and hypertension are the main determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy. Insulin resistance, left ventricular hypertrophy, and circulating levels of C-reactive protein and Gal-3 are associated with a worsening of diastolic function in morbidly obese patients. Obesity upregulates Gal-3 production in the cardiovascular system in a normotensive animal model of diet-induced obesity by feeding for 6 weeks a high-fat diet (33.5% fat). Gal-3 inhibition with modified citrus pectin (100 mg/kg per day) reduced cardiovascular levels of Gal-3, total collagen, collagen I, transforming and connective growth factors, osteopontin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the heart and aorta of obese animals without changes in body weight or blood pressure. In morbidly obese patients, Gal-3 levels are associated with diastolic dysfunction. In obese animals, Gal-3 blockade decreases cardiovascular fibrosis and inflammation. These data suggest that Gal-3 could be a novel therapeutic target in cardiac fibrosis and inflammation associated with obesity.

### Apple pectin for the reduction of niacin-induced flushing [^115aDQgg]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin, or vitamin B3, when used in high doses can significantly improve the levels of all major lipoproteins. Despite these benefits, the use of niacin is greatly limited secondary to benign yet bothersome cutaneous flushing primarily involving the face and upper extremities. Pretreatment with aspirin or other prostaglandin inhibitors has demonstrated significant reductions in niacin-induced flushing (NIF), but other treatment options are needed. Clinical and anecdotal evidence suggests the ingestion of pectin-containing fruits (eg, apple) mitigates NIF; however, clinical trials evaluating this are nonexistent.

Objective

That pretreatment with encapsulated apple pectin would limit the incidence, severity, time of initiation, and duration of NIF.

Methods

We enrolled 100 niacin-naïve subjects (n = 25 per group) and preteated them in a double-blind manner with apple pectin, apple pectin + aspirin, aspirin, or placebo, followed by a one-time 1000 mg dose of niacin extended-release (niacin ER). Subjects then assessed major flushing parameters hourly for the next 6 hours with a validated visual analog scale.

Results

Apple pectin and aspirin each significantly lowered the duration of NIF and produced nonsignificant but positive improvements in all other major flushing parameters compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Apple pectin may potentially be an alternative to aspirin for the prevention of NIF. Larger trials are needed to further evaluate the benefit of pectin on NIF.

### Cancer chemoprevention: lessons learned and future directions [^113FSnx1]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The concept of delaying or preventing epithelial transformation remains a viable and attainable goal for the future. Drug-based strategies for chemoprevention of the future may predominantly rely upon targeted therapies with tolerable but defined toxicities for treatment of individuals diagnosed with intraepithelial neoplasias. Foods, diet manipulation strategies, or nutraceuticals may be more appropriate to delay or prevent carcinogenesis progression in healthy populations with genetic or epidemiologic evidence of risk for future transformation.

### Optimizing bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy: consensus recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116yNafe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Bowel preparation adjuncts beyond simethicone — heterogeneity and patient experience: A meta-analysis of adjuncts included 77 studies and reported heterogeneity was very high (I² = 85%). Chewing gum improved patient satisfaction in one randomized controlled trial (97.4% vs 90.7% among those assigned to not chew gum, P = 0.015). Another meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials, each with no more than 150 patients per arm and using diverse interventions including orange juice with PEG, citric acid diluent, chewing gum every 2 hours, menthol candy drops, and citrus peel tablets, reported heterogeneity for the quality of bowel preparation was quite high (I² = 81%), and concluded the data are not sufficient to support any recommendation for an adjunct to improve bowel preparation aside from simethicone; adjuncts may be reasonable additions to improve patient experience but data are insufficient to recommend any one specific adjunct. The 2023 ASA practice guidelines for preoperative fasting for healthy patients undergoing elective procedures make a conditional suggestion based on very low-quality evidence to not delay elective procedures requiring general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or procedural sedation in healthy adults who are chewing gum.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^113hZwTp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

UGTs glucuronidate bilirubin, estrogens, and exogenous compounds, including dietary carcinogens and prescribed medications. The effects of UGT genotypes on the endogenous concentrations of these compounds, incidences of associated cancers, and responses to select drugs have been reported. An et al. examined the impact of 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 3 SNPs in the UGT1A1 gene, on the daily warfarin dosage. One UGT1A1 SNP (rs887829) exhibited significant association with warfarin use with T -allele carriers requiring higher doses than for individuals with the CC genotype (6.3 compared with 5.2 mg/d, respectively). In a study of 1600 colorectal cancer patients and 2500 unaffected siblings, the variation in 4 UGT genes (UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT2B4, and UGT2B15) modified risk of colorectal cancer either independently of interactively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. Variants in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene (UGT1A1*28, rs8175347), which result in 5, 7, or 8 repeats instead of 6 thymine-adenine repeats, were associated with decreased UGT1A1 transcription and higher serum bilirubin with increased numbers of thymine-adenine repeats. Several dietary phytochemicals, including flavonoids, have been shown to induce UGT1A1 activity, with Lampe and coworkers reporting that the impact of the UGT1A1*28 genotype on bilirubin metabolism was modified by increased intakes of cruciferous vegetables, citrus fruit, and soy. Although intuitively, because of the role of UGT1A1 in flavonoid glucuronidation, the UGT1A1*28 variant is also likely to be an important modulator of flavonoid metabolism, its impact is currently unknown but worthy of investigation.

### Chemoprevention: an essential approach to controlling cancer [^113VqmD9]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2002). Medium credibility.

Mortality that results from the common forms of cancer is still unacceptably high. Despite immense advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in bringing potent new drugs to the clinic and in treating several relatively rare forms of cancer, overall mortality statistics are unlikely to change in a fundamental way until there has been a re-orientation of emphasis in cancer research that will direct greater resources towards prevention of new disease, rather than treatment of end-stage disease.

### Is folic acid associated with lung cancer development? A cross-sectional study in NHANES [^114RD8mY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer (LC), the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, claims approximately 350 lives daily — exceeding the combined death toll of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The lethality of this malignancy stems from its insidious onset, frequently delaying diagnosis until advanced disease, thereby imposing a catastrophic burden on global public health. While tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor, emerging evidence highlights the critical roles of genetic susceptibility and modifiable lifestyle factors, particularly dietary habits, in LC pathogenesis. Therefore, further research is necessary to identify and address the influencing factors of LC and develop effective interventions.

Folic acid, a water-soluble B vitamin, is a cofactor in the essential single-carbon pathway responsible for providing methyl groups to choline phospholipids, creatine, adrenaline, and DNA. Extensive research has been conducted on the relationship between folic acid and various tumors, such as colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, LC, and pancreatic cancer. Numerous studies demonstrated that folic acid supplementation exerted dual modulatory effects in certain cancers. On the one hand, folic acid supplementation may enhance immune function, improve the ability of the body to combat cancer, and mitigate the genotoxic effects. And folic acid supplementation reduces the probability of cancer occurrence by repairing DNA and preserving DNA integrity and stability, since aberrations in DNA potentially increase the risk of cancer development. Primary dietary sources of folate (e.g. leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits) with alkaline nature, may inherently reduce dietary acid load (DAL). Studies suggested that elevated DAL was associated with increased cancer risk, potentially through suppressing folate activity or disrupting metabolic pathways, thereby destabilizing DNA integrity and triggering abnormal cell proliferation, which may elevate lung cancer risk. Thus, folate supplementation may counteract the harmful effects caused by high DAL. On the other hand, increased folate levels can enhance tumor cell proliferation and elevate the risk of cancer by perturbing the homeostasis of single-carbon metabolism or modifying the specific methylation patterns of DNA and histone promoters. These conflicting findings underscore the urgency of clarifying dose-response relationships between folic acid and LC.

Given the uncertain dose-response relationship between folic acid and LC, alongside conflicting evidence on its therapeutic efficacy in tumors, this study analyzed associations of 11 distinct folate forms with LC occurrence and explored novel clinical perspectives, through utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Our findings aimed to reconcile prior discrepancies, inform targeted nutritional guidelines, and identify high-risk populations warranting tailored interventions.

### Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae for co-utilization of D-galacturonic acid and D-glucose from citrus peel waste [^115rU12X]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The S. cerevisiae technologies described here provide platforms for diverting carbon in pectin-rich peel and pulp wastes globally toward diverse renewable chemical and consumer product markets. Such repurposing of current waste streams has the potential to create rural jobs, de-risk the historically volatile juice and sugar markets by accessing more isolated markets, and concurrently provide sustainable feedstocks for fermentation.

### Considering the supraorganism: harnessing the gut microbiome for cancer prevention, detection, and treatment [^1149x4Hm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although causal relationships between specific microbes and cancer are well recognized, a growing body of evidence suggests that the broader community of gut microbes may influence cancer risk, provide diagnostic insight, shape clinical course, and impact treatment success in the gastrointestinal tract and beyond. In this issue, Murphy et al. reviewed evidence for the role of the microbiome in clinical oncology. Given that the gut microbiome may be modified by treatments ranging from diet and live biotherapeutics to microbial transplantation, microbiome-directed therapies hold tremendous promise for personalized therapies and improved treatment outcomes.

### Citrus fruit intake and pancreatic cancer risk: a quantitative systematic review [^113q2FPn]. Pancreas (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the association between dietary intake of citrus fruits and pancreatic cancer risk.

Methods

Authors searched electronic databases and the reference lists of publications of studies addressing diet and pancreatic cancer up to December 2007. All of the epidemiological studies that obtained individual data on dietary intake of citrus fruits and presented risk estimates of the association between intake of citrus fruits and risk of pancreatic cancer were identified and included. Using general variance-based methods, study-specific odds ratios (ORs)/relative risk and associated confidence interval (CI)/SE for highest versus lowest intake of citrus fruits level were extracted from each article.

Results

Nine articles including 4 case-control studies and 5 cohort studies proved eligible. Overall summary OR using random effect model suggested an inverse association in risk of pancreatic cancer with intake of citrus fruits (summary OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98) with large heterogeneity across studies (I = 49.9%).

Conclusions

Pooled results from observational studies showed an inverse association between intake of citrus fruits and the risk of pancreatic cancer, although results vary substantially across studies, and the apparent effect is restricted to the weaker study design (case-control studies).

### Intra-abdominal surgery and intestinal syndromes after pelvic radiation therapy [^115meNn5]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

It was previously found that radiation-induced bowel symptoms can be grouped into 5 syndromes (symptom clusters) with various pathophysiology. The syndromes were labeled "urgency-tenesmus syndrome", "fecal-leakage syndrome", "excessive mucus discharge", "excessive gas discharge", and "blood discharge' and are manifestations of what is termed radiation-induced cancer survivorship diseasesor pelvic radiation diseasein the literature. Based on a modified factor analysis, by weighting factor loadings and symptom frequencies to a factor score, a metric of the intensity of a specific syndrome can be obtained. Lifestyle factors such as diet and tobacco smoking modify the intensity of the syndromes. In this study, we analyzed whether an intra-abdominal procedure (other than the cancer surgery itself) affected the intensity of each of the 5 radiation-induced intestinal syndromes. We also examined whether such an effect, if found, was particularly large among those having undergone an appendectomy and whether tobacco smoking and citrus intake would influence the outcomes. Our setting was a population-based group of survivors of gynecologic cancer who were followed up at 2 to 15 years after radiation therapy.

### Impact of galectins in resistance to anticancer therapies [^113qSQ3t]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Galectins are an endogenous family of β-galactoside-binding proteins that play complex and multifaceted roles at various stages of cancer progression, including modulation of tumor cell proliferation, signaling, adhesion, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and immune escape. Recently, galectins have been implicated as major therapeutic determinants that confer sensitivity or resistance to a wide range of anticancer modalities including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies, antiangiogenic therapies, and immunotherapies. Here, we present an integrated approach to the pleiotropic functions of galectins and discuss their emerging roles with respect to mechanisms of resistance or sensitivity to anticancer therapies. Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting galectins and/or their glycosylated ligands may help to overcome resistance and to increase the clinical efficacy of anticancer strategies.

### Citrin: a novel food allergen in citrus seeds and citrus-derived pectin that shows cross-reactivity with cashew and pistachio [^114PmYhS]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients exquisitely sensitive to cashew/pistachio are at risk for allergic reactions to citrus seeds and pectin.

Objective

In this study, we sought to evaluate whether pectin is contaminated with citrus seeds, to identify a culprit antigen in citrus seeds, and to assess for cross-reactivity among allergens in citrus seeds, citrus pectin, and cashew or pistachio.

Methods

Proteins from orange seed coats, orange seed endosperms, lemon seeds, grapefruit seeds, citrus pectin, apple pectin, and grapefruit pectin were extracted. Protein concentrations in all extracts were determined and visualized using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique. Immunoglobulin E-binding capacity was determined with Western blot analyses and tandem mass spectrometry for the identification of the culprit allergen in citrus seeds and pectin.

Results

In subjects with citrus seed, pectin, and cashew allergies, there was strong immunoglobulin E-reactivity to bands between 17 to 28 kDa and 28 to 38 kDa. The tandem mass spectrometry analysis of these bands indicated the presence of citrin as the culprit allergen. Citrin and Ana o 2 are both 11S globulins belonging to the cupin superfamily, and significant homology was found between these proteins.

Conclusion

Citrus pectin may be contaminated with citrus seeds. Citrin, a newly identified allergen in citrus seeds, seems to be the culprit antigen in citrus seeds and contaminated citrus pectin. Citrin is highly homologous with Ana o 2 in cashew and Pis v 2 in pistachio, suggesting potential for cross-reactivity and providing an explanation for co-allergenicity of cashew or pistachio, citrus seeds, and citrus pectin.

### Intra-abdominal surgery and intestinal syndromes after pelvic radiation therapy [^116ukjB4]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested previously that intra-abdominal surgery reduces the chances of restored intestinal health in survivors of pelvic cancer. There are no data to support any specific pathophysiological processes that could explain the link between intra-abdominal surgery and poor intestinal health. It is known that both the disease that precedes the surgical procedure and the procedure itself could lead to an increased risk of adhesions, reducing the motility of the intestine. The reduced motility results in a greater dose of ionizing radiation to certain parts of the intestines and may result in more severe late effects. However, with regard to the role of the appendix in restoring the preradiation composition and function of the microbiota, very little is known. There is evidence that diet modifies the frequency and intensity of the late effects after pelvic radiation therapy. A growing number of researchers are studying probiotics in this context, with the aim to promote the diversity of the microbiota and improve the intestinal barrier to prevent bacteria from migrating into the intestinal wall. In line with the data emerging from these studies and evidence that the appendix facilitates recovery after intestinal infections, we hypothesized that the lack of a reservoir for microbiota owing to an appendectomy may compromise the recovery of intestinal health after irradiation. We cannot confirm that hypothesis, because our data provide evidence that having only had an appendectomy had no effect or a weak effect on intestinal health after radiation therapy. It can also be speculated that other types of surgeries, such as cholecystectomy, may disrupt the intestinal homeostasis in various ways and increase certain intensity scores.

Intake of citrus fruits has been shown to decrease the intensity of the urgency-tenesmus syndrome, while smoking increases it. A possible explanation is that dietary components high in fiber, such as citrus fruits, have a positive effect on the microbiota and mucus protection, whereas it is known that tobacco smoking reduces tissue healing. We investigated whether the intake of citrus fruits and smoking may be effect-modifying factors for the relationship between intra-abdominal surgery and the intensity of the urgency-tenesmus syndrome. Daily smoking appeared to increase the intensity of the urgency-tenesmus syndrome more in cancer survivors who had undergone an intra-abdominal surgery, but only weakly. The intensity scores tended to decrease in line with higher citrus intake but in a similar manner regardless of having undergone an intra-abdominal surgery or not. Unfortunately, we only have data on the intake of citrus fruits and smoking status from when participants were filling out the questionnaire, not during radiation therapy, intra-abdominal surgery, or other time points during follow-up.

### Strategies for MMP inhibition in cancer: innovations for the post-trial era [^1113RXPh]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2002). Medium credibility.

For more than two decades, the view that tumour-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were required for peritumour tissue degradation and metastasis dominated the drive to develop MMP inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics. Until recently, clinical trials with MMP inhibitors have yielded disappointing results, highlighting the need for better insight into the mechanisms by which this growing family of multifunctional enzymes contribute to tumour growth. It is now recognized that MMP activity is tightly regulated at several levels, providing new avenues for blocking these enzymes. What are the different approaches that can be used to target MMPs, and which of these might lead to new therapeutic strategies for cancer?

### Cancer pharmacomicrobiomics: targeting microbiota to optimise cancer therapy outcomes [^115KDbHT]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Emerging evidence has shown the critical role of gut microbiota in modulating cancer treatment outcomes especially in chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The gut microbiota has extremely complex interactions with cancer drugs by means of pharmacokinetics (eg, metabolism, enzymatic degradation) and pharmacodynamics (eg, immunomodulation).
Meanwhile, cancer therapy can alter the microbiota composition, creating bidirectional interactions.
The gut microbiota has the potential to be a predictive biomarker for cancer treatment responses, which can be useful in guiding the selection of appropriate cancer treatments.
Microbiota modulation, including antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulation and faecal microbiota transplantation, has shown potential in optimising cancer treatment outcomes.
The gut microbiota can be more easily modified compared with host genetics and is expected to play a vital role in next-generation personalised medicine.
Future research should identify a consortium of microbes with remarkable influence on cancer treatments as well as an optimised approach for microbiota modulation.

The rationale and hypothesis for selecting the ingredients of this supplement were that as they originate different food sources (fruit, herb, vegetable and leaf), each with their unique profile and concentration of polyphenols, their separate anti-cancer mechanisms, summarised above, could be synergistic, yet at the same time their variable composition would avoid over-consumption of one particular phytochemical. The trial committee determined the concentration of each ingredient based on the amounts safely used within previous clinical studies.

Gilliamella showed limited ability to degrade pectin in the presence of methyl substituents on the homogalacturonan backbone.

A The genetic structures of the two primary CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) involved in the degradation of homogalacturonan in Gillamella apicola. The direction and length of arrows indicate the orientation and size of genes. B The modular architecture of the three primary pectin lyases (PLs) encoded by G. apicola. The pink color represents the catalytic domain of the enzyme, whereas the green color indicates the signal peptide (SP). C The schematic illustrates the degradation and utilization of homogalacturonan by Gilliamella. The three PLs are spatially and hierarchically orchestrated in the pectin degradation process. PL1 acts extracellularly targeting for large molecular homogalacturonan to produce unsaturated oligogalacturonides. PL9 in the periplasm subsequently cleavages the oligosaccharides into unsaturated disaccharide galacturonic acids (di-GalA). PL22 further degrades di-GalA into one unsaturated and one saturated GalA. CE12 is a pectin acetylesterase, cleaving acetyl groups from the homogalacturonan backbone. D The growth of Gilliamella on either de-methylated polygalacturonic acid (PGA) or citrus pectin (PC).

### Management of predictable pain using fentanyl pectin nasal spray in patients undergoing radiotherapy [^11385zu8]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

FPNS was without difficulty in regard to tapering its use over a 2–4-week period after completion of radiotherapy. Tapering FPNS was simplified in regard to its short-acting and peak response times. Bioavailability and exit of the drug was rapid and there did not appear to be a need for high-dose drug escalation in most of the patients in this series. Clinical observation of constipation and lethargy appeared to be decreased overall compared with longer-acting fentanyl which also appeared to require longer tapering intervals in comparison. These experiences suggest that future research with controlled clinical trials would be warranted to better optimize the management of pain in the radiotherapy setting.

### Galectin-3 and risk for cancer or Heart Failure: does sex matter? [^116PCBbP]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although this paper presents an intriguing hypothesis and offers challenging findings, some limitations should be mentioned. First, the retrospective nature of this work limits the applicability of its findings. Their confirmation, in a prospective evaluation, would require consideration for various confounding factors that likely influence the predictive value of Gal-3, including: 1) the etiology of HF; 2) the incorporation of known Gal-3 inhibitors, such as pectin in the diet or mineral corticosteroid receptor blockers as HF and hypertension pharmacologic agents; 3) consideration of the prevalence of childbearing age in women; and 4) the use of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. In this respect, as there might be a direct influence of sexual hormones on Gal-3 during tumor pathogenesis, the measurement of Gal-3 could have different implications in either sex, as a sex-specific influence on cardiac structural remodeling and therapy is recognized in cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, the small sample of women (n = 67) who developed HF limits the findings relative at the influence of sex on the significance of Gal-3. Future prospective studies should address another unmet relevant issue: the temporal correlation between the evidence of elevated Gal-3 levels and diagnosis of either new-onset malignancy or HF, which could favor routine clinical implementation of this biomarker. From a methodological perspective, a thorough echocardiographic evaluation using global longitudinal strain assessment would potentially detect a worse functional trajectory earlier, compared with the sole evaluation of ejection fraction as in this study, depicting a more precise correlation between Gal-3 elevation and cardiac dysfunction. Finally, cardiac troponins and B-type natriuretic peptides, among many biomarkers of cardiovascular pathology, have been evaluated for their potential in predicting either HF or cancer (eg, gastrointestinal and pelvic tumors) incidence, as well mortality. In this regard, future studies should address the issue of the additive independent value of Gal-3, compared with high-sensitivity troponins and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide, and their eventual increased predictive value, when used in combination.

### Cancer chemoprevention: a rapidly evolving field [^117P58G6]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer chemoprevention involves the chronic administration of a synthetic, natural or biological agent to reduce or delay the occurrence of malignancy. The potential value of this approach has been demonstrated with trials in breast, prostate and colon cancer. The paradigm for developing new chemopreventive agents has changed markedly in the last decade and now involves extensive preclinical mechanistic evaluation of agents before clinical trials are instituted and a focus on defining biomarkers of activity that can be used as early predictors of efficacy. This review will summarise the current status of the field of chemoprevention and highlight potential new developments.

### Dietary pectic glycans are degraded by coordinated enzyme pathways in human colonic Bacteroides [^111ua6Wk]. Nature Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The major nutrients available to human colonic Bacteroides species are glycans, exemplified by pectins, a network of covalently linked plant cell wall polysaccharides containing galacturonic acid (GalA). Metabolism of complex carbohydrates by the Bacteroides genus is orchestrated by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). In Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a human colonic bacterium, the PULs activated by different pectin domains have been identified; however, the mechanism by which these loci contribute to the degradation of these GalA-containing polysaccharides is poorly understood. Here we show that each PUL orchestrates the metabolism of specific pectin molecules, recruiting enzymes from two previously unknown glycoside hydrolase families. The apparatus that depolymerizes the backbone of rhamnogalacturonan-I is particularly complex. This system contains several glycoside hydrolases that trim the remnants of other pectin domains attached to rhamnogalacturonan-I, and nine enzymes that contribute to the degradation of the backbone that makes up a rhamnose-GalA repeating unit. The catalytic properties of the pectin-degrading enzymes are optimized to protect the glycan cues that activate the specific PULs ensuring a continuous supply of inducing molecules throughout growth.

### Mechanisms of disease: prostate cancer – a model for cancer chemoprevention in clinical practice [^111pUqNu]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is a significant cause of cancer death, making it an attractive target for chemoprevention. Epidemiologic studies and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial indicate that chemoprevention is possible. Strategies for prevention include hormonal manipulation and limiting accumulation of genetic damage with anti-inflammatory agents and/or dietary antioxidants. Development of an effective chemoprevention strategy for prostate cancer is evolving and will likely serve as a model for chemoprevention of other adult malignancies.

### Galectin-1 as a potential cancer target [^116sXVQG]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

GALECTIN-1 AS A TARGET FOR ANTICANCER AGENTS: CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

Given the contribution of galectin-1 to tumour growth and metastasis, it is predicted that inhibitors of galectin-1 will find their way into cancer clinical trials, leading to delays in tumour progression and improvements in overall survival. Challenges for the future will be to employ potent and selective small inhibitors of galectin-1 and, in fact, molecules with such properties have already been developed for galectin-1 or other galectins. Furthermore, galectin-1 expression can be modulated by chemotherapeutic and antimetastatic agents. A current challenge is the design of more specific and potent galectin-1 inhibitors for therapeutic purposes with no or minimal adverse effects. Although galectin-1 still remains elusive in terms of our understanding of its multifunctional modes of action, we are moving ever closer to unravelling this mystery at a molecular level and to design new therapeutic approaches directed toward modulating its activities.

### General aspects of anti-angiogenesis and cancer therapy [^114sP5Fc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

Angiogenesis is the outgrowth of new vessels from pre-existing ones. Tumour growth and metastasis is dependent on angiogenesis and many stimulatory and inhibitory factors have been described which play an active role in this process. Inhibition of tumour neovasculature may be one strategy to inhibit tumour growth. Naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis have been discovered and synthetic agents have been designed. Many of these inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. This review discusses the mechanism of action of these anti-angiogenics as well as a description of the clinical trials in which they are being evaluated.

### Microbiota modification in hematology: still at the bench or ready for the bedside? [^1121XhoC]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence suggests that human microbiota likely influence diverse processes including hematopoiesis, chemotherapy metabolism, and efficacy, as well as overall survival in patients with hematologic malignancies and other cancers. Both host genetic susceptibility and host-microbiota interactions may impact cancer risk and response to treatment; however, microbiota have the potential to be uniquely modifiable and accessible targets for treatment. Here, we focus on strategies to modify microbiota composition and function in patients with cancer. First, we evaluate the use of fecal microbiota transplant to restore microbial equilibrium following perturbation by antibiotics and chemotherapy, and as a treatment of complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), such as graft-versus-host disease and colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. We then address the potential use of both probiotics and dietary prebiotic compounds in targeted modulation of the microbiota intended to improve outcomes in hematologic diseases. With each type of therapy, we highlight the role that abnormal, or dysbiotic, microbiota play in disease, treatment efficacy, and toxicity and evaluate their potential promise as emerging strategies for microbiota manipulation in patients with hematologic malignancies and in those undergoing HSCT.

### Intra-abdominal surgery and intestinal syndromes after pelvic radiation therapy [^1129ye8x]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The distributions of the intensities of the 5 radiation-induced survivorship syndromes among individuals having undergone intra-abdominal surgery and those not having undergone intra-abdominal surgery within the studied group of cancer survivors who had undergone irradiation were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. An analogous comparison was performed among the individuals who had not undergone irradiation. Furthermore, the individuals having undergone intra-abdominal surgery were subsequently divided into those having undergone only appendectomy and those having undergone intra-abdominal surgery excluding appendectomy. Examples of common intra-abdominal surgeries were ectopic pregnancy, cholecystectomy, caesarian section, and removal of ovarian cysts. Surgeries that were performed as part of the cancer treatment were not included. Additionally, we added those who had undergone both an appendectomy and 1 or more other intra-abdominal surgeries. These subgroups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by the Dunn post hoc test. To investigate the presence of possible effect modification from lifestyle factors, smoking status and citrus intake were selected for analysis based on the results of previous studies exploring the relationships between the syndrome intensities and demographical information. Spearman correlation analysis was used to disclose potential associations between syndrome intensity and smoking status or citrus intake. Furthermore, using t tests, 95% confidence intervals on the difference in mean syndrome intensity between cancer survivors having and not having undergone intra-abdominal surgery within the extreme categories of the potential effect modifiers were calculated (never and current for smoking and weekly and daily for citrus intake). In a conservative approach to detect deviations from additivity of the effect of intra-abdominal surgery on syndrome intensities across potential confounder categories, the confidence intervals were examined for nonoverlap, but no such situations occurred.

Lastly, since many (but not all) of the participants reported that they had given birth, anal-sphincter damage was assessed as a possible effect-modifying factor.

### Complementary therapies and integrative medicine in lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1166D4pB]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Nutrition and lung cancer prevention — observational findings: Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake of fruits and vegetables, with the results of this evaluation showing evidence for a significant inverse association between vegetable consumption and lung cancer incidence in smokers, and the risk of squamous cell carcinomas specifically for current smokers was reduced with increasing fruit and vegetable consumption; data are similar for carotenoid intake from dietary sources (not supplements), demonstrating that dietary carotenoid intake, including higher serum levels of carotenoids, was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. In the β-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), another large chemoprevention trial of 18,000 smokers, former smokers, and workers exposed to asbestos, β-carotene and vitamin A supplementation again was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer, whereas subanalyses revealed that intake of fruits and vegetables from a dietary source was associated with a reduced lung cancer risk in the placebo arm, with the association strongest with rosaceae fruit or cruciferate vegetables; epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a higher intake of cruciferous vegetables was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer after carefully controlling for cigarette smoking. Evidence on the role of nutrition in lung cancer prevention comes predominantly from observational studies, and there is a lack of RCTs, but the risks and burdens to patients are low.

### Galectin-1 as a potential cancer target [^115MGV4k]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Galectins are a family of structurally related carbohydrate-binding proteins, which are defined by their affinity for poly-N-acetyllactosamine-enriched glycoconjugates and sequence similarities in the carbohydrate recognition domain. Galectin-1, a member of this family, contributes to different events associated with cancer biology, including tumour transformation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration and inflammation. In addition, recent evidence indicates that galectin-1 contributes to tumour evasion of immune responses. Given the increased interest of tumour biologists and clinical oncologists in this field and the potential use of galectins as novel targets for anticancer drugs, we summarise here recent advances about the role of galectin-1 in different events of tumour growth and metastasis.

### Intake of dietary flavonoids and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [^116dN7kH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large prospective cohort study we observed that participants who had the highest habitual intakes of flavonols and flavanones had significantly lower risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Associations for flavanones were more strongly associated with lower risk of serous and poorly differentiated tumors, a more-aggressive disease phenotype. Main sources of these compounds include tea and citrus fruits or juice, foods and drinks that are readily incorporated into the habitual diet, suggesting that simple changes in food intake could have an impact on ovarian cancer risk. To our knowledge, this is the only prospective study to comprehensively examine the 6 major flavonoid subclasses present in the diet with ovarian cancer risk and the first to investigate the impact of polymers and anthocyanins.

In the current study, we observed significantly lower risk of high intakes of flavonols and flavanones only for women in the top quintile (compared with the bottom quintile) of intakes. This results may have been because the absolute range in intake across the 3 middle quintiles compared with the lowest quintile was relatively small (eg, 10 mg for flavonols and 33 mg for flavanones); the measurement error in these middle quintiles may have obscured an association. Another possibility is that there was a threshold effect. Previous data suggested that there may be a threshold dose required for biological effects and low intakes are unlikely to be bioactive. When we compared extreme deciles of intake, subjects in the top decile had 29% (flavonols) and 28% (flavanones) reductions in risk of ovarian cancer, which suggested a continual dose-response at higher habitual intakes.

### Galectins and their ligands: amplifiers, silencers or tuners of the inflammatory response? [^112q77BL]. Trends in Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent evidence has implicated galectins and their ligands as master regulators of immune cell homeostasis. Whereas some members of this family, such as galectin-3, behave as amplifiers of the inflammatory cascade, others, such as galectin-1, trigger homeostatic signals to shut off T-cell effector functions. These carbohydrate-binding proteins, identified by shared consensus amino acid sequences and affinity for beta-galactoside-containing sugars, participate in the homeostasis of the inflammatory response, either by regulating cell survival and signaling, influencing cell growth and chemotaxis, interfering with cytokine secretion, mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions or influencing tumor progression and metastasis. The current wealth of new information promises a future scenario in which individual members of the galectin family or their ligands will be used as powerful anti-inflammatory mediators and selective modulators of the immune response.

### Improved outcomes utilizing a novel pectin-based pleural sealant following acute lung injury [^111NmBhc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent air leaks after thoracic trauma are associated with significant morbidity. To evaluate a novel pectin sealant in a swine model of traumatic air leaks, we compared a pectin biopolymer with standard surgical and fibrin-based interventions.

Methods

A standardized lung injury was created in male Yorkshire swine. Interventions were randomized to stapled wedge resection (n = 5), topical fibrin glue (n = 5), fibrin patch (n = 5), and a pectin sealant (n = 6). Baseline, preintervention and postintervention tidal volumes (TV) were recorded. Early success was defined as the return to near-normal TV (> 95% of baseline). Late success was defined as no detectable air leak in the chest tube after chest closure.

Results

There were no differences in injury severity between groups (mean TV loss, 62 ± 17 mL, p = 0.2). Early success was appreciated in 100% (n = 6) of the pectin interventions which was significantly better than the fibrin sealant (20%, n = 1), fibrin patch (20%, n = 1), and stapled groups (80%, n = 4, p = 0.01). The percent of return to baseline TV after sealant intervention was significantly increased in the pectin (98%) and staple arms (97%) compared with the fibrin sealant (91%) and fibrin patch arms (90%) (p = 0.02; p = 0.03). Late success was also improved with the pectin sealant: no air leak was detected in 83% of the pectin group compared with 40% in the stapled group (p = 0.008)-90% of the fibrin-based interventions resulted in continuous air leaks (p = 0.001).

Conclusion

Pectin-based bioadhesives effectively seal traumatic air leaks upon application in a porcine model. Further testing is warranted as they may provide a superior parenchymal-sparing treatment option for traumatic air leaks.

### The immunogenicity, safety, and consistency of an Indonesia combined DTP-HB-hib vaccine in expanded program on immunization schedule [^114yLC5W]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The investigational DTP-HB-Hib combination vaccine has proven high immunogenicity for all vaccine antigens and an acceptable safety profile. This study supports the conclusion that the Bio Farma DTP-HB-Hib combination vaccine is a suitable replacement for the licensed-equivalent vaccines based on similar safety profiles, and antibody responses to the vaccine antigens after 3-dose primary vaccination series. Replacement of standard DTP-HB vaccine, which already has high coverage, with DTP-HB-Hib can be done without modifying the existing EPI schedule. This should facilitate widespread coverage of Hib vaccination and their rapid incorporation into the EPI, and WHO recommendations for controlling Hib disease which are responsible for substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide.

### P-MCP treatment in non-metastatic biochemically relapsed prostate cancer (BRPC-M0): final long-term results of a prospective phase II study… [^116uoDRP]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 162 Background: 30% of patients with localized PC will have a biochemical relapse post local therapy. Their optimal treatment remains elusive. While androgen deprivation therapy is effective in reducing PSA level, its long-term benefit remains undefined, and it is toxic. Thus, evaluation of new nontoxic compounds in these patients is warranted. PectaSol-C modified citrus pectin is an inhibitor of galectin-3 protein, which is involved in prostate cancer pathogenesis. We herein report the final long-term results of a multi-center phase 2 study of P-MCP treatment in BRPC-M0. Methods: Patients with BRPC-M0 were enrolled and treated with P-MCP,
4.8 grams × 3/day, for 6 months. Patients without PSA progression and/or with improvement of PSA doubling time, and with negative scans, were treated for an additional 12 months. Results: 59 patients were initially enrolled.

After initial 6 months of therapy, 46 patients without disease progression entered the second phase of additional 12 months therapy. Among them, 7 patients withdrew consent and chose to continue therapy out of pocket. Of the remaining 39 patients, after another year of therapy, 85% had an overall long-term response, with a decreased/stable PSA, and improvement of PSADT, and with negative scans. No patient had grade 3/4 toxicity. Conclusions: P-MCP may have a durable long-term efficacy in patients with BRPC-M0. Clinical trial information: NCT01681823.

### NCT01681823 | Effect of modified citrus pectin on PSA kinetics in… [^1111FP2D]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study on the effect of PectaSol-C Modified Citrus Pectin with subjects selected on the basis of documented PC post local therapy, and biochemical relapse, with linear progression of at least 3 PSA tests in at least 3 months. After initial screening, treatment {4.8 grams three times a day away from meals} will continue for 6 months provided patients are showing benefit and tolerating the therapy well. Patient tolerability of MCP will be assessed by comparing the results of monthly self-assessment diaries with baseline assessments. This specific modification is critical as it allows for the absorption of MCP into the circulatory system and ensures its targeted bioactivity throughout the body. MCP is relatively rich in galactose and thus antagonizes the binding protein galectin-3 which results in suppression of cancer cell aggregation, adhesion, and metastasis.

MCP acts as a ligand for galectin-3, which plays a major role in tumor formation and progression. It has been shown using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and atomic force microscopy, that pectin galactan specifically binds to the recombinant form of human galectin-3. MCP showed anti-metastatic effects on cancer cells in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies. MCP inhibits carbohydrate mediated tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis via effects on galectin-3 function as demonstrated in an animal study on MCP's inhibition of breast and colon cancer progression. Results demonstrated a 70. 2% reduction in breast tumor growth, a 66% reduction in breast angiogenesis, and 0% breast to lung metastasis compared to 100% in the control group; 0% colon to liver metastasis compared to 60% in the control group; and 25% colon to lymph metastasis compared to 100% in the control group.

In an earlier study oral intake of MCP had been shown to act as a potent inhibitor of spontaneous prostate carcinoma metastasis in an animal model, demonstrating a significant 56% reduction in lung metastases. These results show promise for the use of MCP with doxorubicin as an adjuvant to chemotherapy which may allow for lower dosage of the cancer drug to be used with less toxicity. A human clinical pilot trial with MCP showed an increase in prostate specific antigen doubling time, a marker of slowing the progression of prostate cancer. Clinical research on MCP also demonstrated a significant improvement in quality of life and stabilization of disease for patients with advanced solid tumors.

### Effect of pectaSol-C modified citrus pectin (P-MCP) treatment (tx) on PSA dynamics in patients (pts) with nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer (BRPC): results of the interim analysis of a prospective phase II study… [^1147szj6]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract e16588 Background: 30% of pts with localized PC will have a biochemical relapse post local tx. The optimal tx of these pts remains elusive. While androgen deprivation therapy is effective in reducing PSA level, its long term benefit on survival remain undefined, and it is associated with significant cumulative toxicities. Thus evaluation of new non-toxic compounds in this pt population is warranted. P-MCP is a competitive inhibitor of galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, which is known to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. Preliminary pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that P-MCP is active in PC. We aimed to evaluate the safety and PSA dynamics of tx with P-MCP in pts with BRPC. Methods: Pts with non-castrate non metastatic BRPC were enrolled in a prospective phase 2 study of tx with oral P-MCP, at 4.8 grams × 3/day. Pts that did not progress clinically, biochemically, and radiologically, at 6 months, were treated for subsequent 12 mos.

Sample size provided 85% power to assess a decrease in PSA progression rate from 80% to 40% at 6 mos. We report here first results of a pre-planned interim analysis after ≤ 50% of planned enrolled pt completed 6 mos of tx. No pt had tx related grade 3/4 toxicity. One patient withdrew his consent after 1 mos. Of the 34 pts analysed, 18% had grade 1 toxicity. 62% had a stabilization/decrease of PSA, and negative scans, at 6 mo, and entered into the second 12 mos tx phase. A stabilization or improvement of PSA doubling time was noted in 79% of pts. Disease progression at 6 mos was noted in 38%. A future final report will include full tx data and correlative analysis.

### Effect of pectasol-C modified citrus pectin (P-MCP) treatment (tx) on PSA dynamics in non-metastatic biochemically relapsed prostate cancer (BRPC) patients (pts): primary outcome analysis of a prospective phase II study… [^116FtaeM]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

P-MCP is a competitive inhibitor of galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, known to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. Pre-clinical data suggest that P-MCP is active in PC, and in two previous smaller clinical trials in biochemically relapsed prostate cancer pts, a PSA response/stabilization rate of 57%-75% was noted. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and PSA dynamics of P-MCP tx in BRPC pts. The primary outcome was the rate of pts without disease progression at 6 mos. A Sample size of ≥ 50 pts provided 85% power to assess a decrease in DP rate from 80% to 40% at 6 mos. Pts that did not progress at 6 mos, were treated for subsequent 12 mos. Herein we report the results of the primary outcome analysis. Results: 53 pts were enrolled.

Median age was 74 years. Tx of the primary tumor consisted of surgery in 13%, radiation in 60%, and both in 26%. No pt had tx related grade 3/4 toxicity. One pt withdrew his consent after 1 mos. At present, 46 pts completed 6 mos of tx, and were analyzed for the primary outcome. Among them, 20% had grade 1 toxicity. Full cohort data will be available by June 2019. *) Conclusions: The present study suggests the safety and potential benefit of P-MCP tx on progression of BRPC. Clinical trial information: NCT01681823.
