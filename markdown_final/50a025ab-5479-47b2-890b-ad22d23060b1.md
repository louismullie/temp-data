## Question

toenail onychomycosis treatment in the primary care office

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about toenail onychomycosis treatment in the primary care office. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and misdiagnosis risk. Then, I should structure severity assessment and risk stratification. Next, I will determine when to use topical versus oral versus combination therapy, including dosing and duration. After that, I must address safety checks, lab monitoring, and drug interactions. I also need to plan follow-up, endpoints, adjunctive measures, and management of failure or recurrence. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention, and referral indications, making sure to verify each recommendation against guidelines and key trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before jumping into treatment choices, because clinical mimics like psoriasis and trauma are common and systemic therapy should not be started without objective mycology. I should check KOH microscopy, culture, or PAS stain; AAFP 2014 explicitly recommends confirmatory testing prior to therapy, and BAD 2014 similarly emphasizes mycological confirmation, especially before systemic agents. Wait, let me verify cost and practicality: a decision analysis suggested that empiric terbinafine might be cost-saving at high pretest probability, but that must be balanced against the risk of treating nonfungal dystrophies; in primary care, if testing is not feasible, initiating a topical based on typical appearance can be reasonable, but I should still avoid systemic therapy without confirmation [^112cyXJs] [^114oMws9] [^115rAxDM] [^113z5Tm2].

> Next, I should review severity and prognostic factors to guide therapy intensity. Let me think about practical severity bands by percent nail involvement and number of nails, while noting a caveat: there is no universal severity scale and a pilot analysis found baseline percent involvement did not consistently predict efinaconazole outcomes, so I need to avoid overinterpreting severity as a prognostic marker. I should also identify high-risk features for poor response or relapse such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, older age, male sex, long duration of disease, lateral disease, dermatophytoma, and longitudinal spikes, all of which can justify earlier combination therapy or referral. Hold on, I should verify the evidence strength: much of the risk-factor literature is observational and older, so I will use it to inform but not dictate decisions [^1127Qx9o] [^116XJ4mL] [^112dVcoD].

> Before committing to systemic therapy, I need to check for contraindications and plan labs. Initially, I was going to say BAD 2014 mandates baseline LFTs and CBC for all systemic antifungals, but wait, I should double-check: BAD 2014 advises baseline labs particularly in adults with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematologic abnormalities and during higher-risk systemic regimens, with attention to drug–drug interactions, especially for azoles. I should confirm that terbinafine remains first-line for dermatophyte toenails and that monitoring is individualized; prolonged or higher-dose fluconazole requires periodic LFTs. Given polypharmacy in older adults, I need to screen carefully for CYP-mediated interactions, particularly with itraconazole, and consider a topical-first approach when the interaction burden is high [^114oMws9] [^117BnDuN] [^114oMws9].

> For mild disease with limited nail involvement and no matrix disease, I should consider topical monotherapy, and efinaconazole 10% once daily for up to 48 weeks is a reasonable first-line. Let me verify comparative evidence: BAD 2014 lists efinaconazole as an option and also includes amorolfine and ciclopirox; Cochrane 2020 confirms that modern topicals improve complete cure versus vehicle in mild-to-moderate cases, albeit with modest absolute cures and long timelines. Post hoc and single-arm studies suggest progressive gains through week 52–72 and meaningful reductions in percent involvement, but I must acknowledge these are lower-credibility designs; still, they are consistent with pragmatic expectations and patient-reported improvements when adherence is sustained [^115bUy8N] [^117FtDr9] [^1127Qx9o] [^1116pzTv] [^111nUh1S].

> For moderate disease or multiple nails, I should prioritize oral therapy or combination therapy. I will now examine terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12–16 weeks as preferred for dermatophyte toenails; continuous dosing outperforms pulse dosing for mycologic and clinical cure at 18 months, and network meta-analysis shows higher odds of mycologic cure with continuous terbinafine or itraconazole versus topicals. But wait, what if oral therapy is contraindicated? In that scenario, extended efinaconazole with rigorous adherence and follow-up is appropriate, though I should set expectations about slower clearance. In higher-risk patients (e.g., diabetes or many nails), adding a topical to oral therapy up front can make sense, given poor penetration in some subungual niches and the general mycology principle supporting combination therapy [^114oMws9] [^111DaRFd] [^1158mkjV] [^1147QjSw] [^112D9kKM] [^115R2qjp].

> For severe disease with greater than 50% involvement, matrix disease, dermatophytoma, or near-total involvement, I need to ensure a more aggressive approach. Let me first confirm that combination therapy is favored when topical monotherapy response is likely poor; BAD 2014 supports combination in such cases, and oral terbinafine plus topical efinaconazole is a pragmatic choice. I should also consider that efinaconazole has demonstrated incremental improvements over 12–18 months even in severe cohorts, but single-arm data should be interpreted cautiously; in practice, I will position efinaconazole as an adjunct rather than a replacement for systemic therapy in severe disease. For dermatophytoma or longitudinal spikes, response to oral monotherapy can be refractory, so concurrent topical with mechanical debulking is reasonable, with early dermatology or podiatry involvement [^1147QjSw] [^116yweLU] [^1116pzTv] [^116XJ4mL].

> I should initiate adjunctive measures to maximize cure and reduce relapse. Hold on, I should verify the role of debridement: BAD 2014 advises against debridement alone as treatment, but supports mechanical removal of dermatophytomas and thick subungual debris as an adjunct to improve drug access. I need to treat coexistent tinea pedis aggressively because the skin and family contacts may serve as reservoirs for reinfection. I must also educate patients about the slow nail growth trajectory, emphasizing that visible clearance lags mycologic cure and that persistence is essential to prevent premature discontinuation [^116yweLU] [^114tHTyi] [^1127Qx9o].

> Monitoring should be structured and purposeful. I should confirm early that a mycologic endpoint (KOH or culture negativity) often precedes full clinical clearance; efinaconazole cohorts show negative microscopy rates rising by 24–36 weeks and continuing through 72 weeks. For systemic therapy, I need to review for adverse effects at 4–6 weeks and consider LFT checks based on baseline risk, concomitant hepatotoxins, and regimen choice rather than reflexive universal testing. For oral regimens with higher hepatic risk or prolonged duration, periodic LFT monitoring is prudent, and any symptoms should prompt immediate evaluation. I should set visit expectations around weeks 12, 24, and 48–72 to align clinical and mycologic goals and reduce dropouts [^1164x52o] [^1116pzTv] [^114oMws9] [^117BnDuN].

> In pediatric patients, I need to ensure weight-appropriate dosing and safety. Let me verify recommendations: BAD 2014 supports itraconazole or terbinafine as first-line when dosing is feasible, with griseofulvin as a second-line option given lower efficacy but established safety, and fluconazole weekly as another second-line alternative when others are not tolerated. I should confirm baseline labs based on risk and consider periodic LFTs for prolonged or higher-dose azole therapy. Topicals remain an option for limited disease or when systemic therapy is undesirable, with the understanding of longer timelines and lower complete cure rates [^1113KGt4] [^114K4GYx] [^113ngSPV].

> For elderly or polypharmacy patients, I need to balance efficacy with interaction risk. Let me reconsider the initial instinct to avoid all orals; terbinafine often remains manageable from an interaction standpoint compared to itraconazole, but I should still review concurrent drugs meticulously. If the interaction burden is high or patient preference dictates, efinaconazole can be favored, with data suggesting similar mycologic outcomes in older adults and low systemic risk in long-term use. Shared decision-making around expected timelines and functional goals is essential here [^112CywgH] [^116JnbqP].

> When treatment fails or disease recurs, I should step back and verify key points: Was the original diagnosis confirmed, was adherence adequate for the required duration, and are there reservoirs like tinea pedis or family members perpetuating reinfection. If true failure is present, I can switch classes, for example, from terbinafine to itraconazole or to weekly fluconazole when standard agents are not tolerated; I should also intensify to combination therapy if not already used. I need to remember that pulse terbinafine is inferior to continuous dosing, so I should avoid downgrading to pulse regimens when I am trying to rescue a partial response. For refractory patterns such as dermatophytoma or spike lesions, early referral for debridement, possible avulsion, or discussion of device-based adjuncts is reasonable, acknowledging that evidence for lasers and photodynamic therapy remains limited and inconsistent [^1147QjSw] [^112D9kKM] [^111DaRFd] [^113CScMT] [^1172Y3Lp] [^115XwZqP].

> Prevention of recurrence needs deliberate planning. I should counsel that 25–40% may recur within roughly 2–3 years after apparent cure, so ongoing foot hygiene, shoe disinfection, and household skin infection control matter. Treating tinea pedis in the patient and close contacts can reduce reinoculation. Although small studies found no benefit to biweekly miconazole powder prophylaxis, off-label low-frequency maintenance with efinaconazole may be considered in select high-risk patients after shared decision-making, given the lack of robust prophylaxis trials. I need to ensure this plan is individualized and revisited over time [^111Aifqk] [^113Qb8BK] [^115MkSxK] [^114tHTyi].

> I should articulate clear referral triggers. Immediate referral is warranted when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is severe disease with complications such as diabetic foot risk, immunosuppression, pediatric complexity, or refractory subtypes like dermatophytoma and longitudinal spikes. Podiatry referral for mechanical debridement can be pivotal in thick nails and in patients with functional impairment or vascular disease, improving access of therapies and reducing painful pressure, while dermatology input helps in complex diagnostic differentials and rescue strategies [^114oMws9] [^117UpkWy] [^116XJ4mL].

> Finally, I should not ignore the health system context. I need to check my own thresholds because national ambulatory data suggest treatment is prescribed at only about 20% of onychomycosis visits, indicating undertreatment and missed opportunities to improve quality of life; at the same time, some regions show persistent overuse of topical monotherapy in patients who would benefit more from oral agents. Cost-effectiveness analyses and claims data from outside the U.S. hint that oral therapy is often more cost-effective than prolonged topical courses, but I should interpret such findings cautiously due to data limitations and ensure my choices are guided by confirmed diagnosis, severity, comorbidity, and patient preferences [^114Atcth] [^117JT8Nm] [^115E7KY2].

In primary care, **confirm onychomycosis with KOH [^112cyXJs], culture, or PAS before treatment** [^115rAxDM]. For dermatophyte toenail disease, **terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks** is first-line [^114oMws9]; check baseline LFTs and CBC in adults with liver or hematologic risk, and monitor LFTs if high-risk or on prolonged therapy. Use **topical efinaconazole 10% once daily** for 48 weeks [^115bUy8N] in mild disease [^1127Qx9o] or when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Combine oral and topical therapy for severe or refractory cases [^1147QjSw], and **educate on adherence, foot hygiene, and recurrence prevention** [^111Aifqk]; refer to dermatology for severe, refractory, or atypical cases.

---

## Diagnosis and confirmation

Accurate diagnosis is essential **before initiating treatment** [^112cyXJs]. Clinical diagnosis alone is insufficient because it can mimic conditions such as psoriasis, lichen planus, or traumatic nail dystrophy [^112QUz1v]. Therefore, confirmatory laboratory testing is recommended [^115rAxDM]:

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation**: Rapid [^112cyXJs], inexpensive, and widely available in primary care settings.

- **Fungal culture**: Gold standard [^112QUz1v] for identifying the specific fungal organism, though results may take several weeks.

- **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain**: Highly sensitive histological method [^115rAxDM], particularly useful when KOH or culture results are inconclusive.

Confirmatory testing is particularly important before initiating **systemic therapy** [^112cyXJs] to avoid unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects and drug interactions.

---

## Treatment options

Treatment selection depends on the **severity of nail involvement** [^114oMws9], patient comorbidities, and patient preferences. The primary options include systemic antifungal therapy, topical antifungal therapy, and combination therapy.

---

### Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic antifungal agents are the **cornerstone of treatment** [^1158mkjV] for moderate to severe onychomycosis, particularly with multiple nails or significant nail matrix involvement.

- **Terbinafine**: First-line systemic therapy for dermatophyte onychomycosis. Recommended dosage is 250 mg daily [^114oMws9] for 12 weeks for toenail infections. Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and complete blood count (CBC) are recommended, particularly in patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

- **Itraconazole**: Alternative systemic therapy, particularly useful for non-dermatophyte molds or yeast infections. Recommended dosage is 200 mg daily for 12 weeks or pulse therapy [^112CywgH] (400 mg daily for 1 week per month, repeated for three pulses).

- **Fluconazole**: Considered in patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Dosage is 150–450 mg weekly [^117BnDuN] for at least 6 months.

Systemic therapy requires **careful monitoring** for potential adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^114oMws9].

---

### Topical antifungal therapy

Topical antifungal agents are suitable for **mild to moderate onychomycosis** [^1127Qx9o], particularly when systemic therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. **Efinaconazole 10% solution** [^115bUy8N] applied once daily for 48 weeks is recommended for mild to moderate distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO). **Ciclopirox 8% lacquer** [^117FtDr9] is applied once daily for up to 48 weeks and is recommended when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Additionally, **topical therapy requires patient adherence** and regular nail debridement to enhance drug penetration [^117UpkWy].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy (systemic plus topical) is recommended [^1147QjSw] for **severe or refractory cases**, particularly when response to topical monotherapy is likely to be poor. It may improve cure rates and reduce recurrence [^112D9kKM].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patient education is critical to ensure **adherence to prolonged treatment regimens** and to prevent recurrence [^111Aifqk]. Key educational points include:

- **Importance of adherence**: Emphasize the need for consistent medication use and regular follow-up visits [^115MkSxK].

- **Foot hygiene**: Encourage regular washing and drying of feet, use of antifungal powders, and avoidance of shared footwear [^117UpkWy].

- **Recurrence prevention**: Educate patients on the chronic nature of onychomycosis and the importance of ongoing preventive measures [^112dVcoD].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up visits are **essential** to monitor treatment response, adherence, and potential adverse effects. Clinical and mycological cure should be confirmed through follow-up testing. Recurrence rates are high, necessitating ongoing monitoring and preventive measures [^111Aifqk].

---

## Referral to dermatology

Referral to dermatology is indicated for **severe or refractory cases** with extensive nail involvement, failure of initial therapy, or dermatophytoma. Referral is also appropriate for atypical presentations (e.g. suspected non-dermatophyte molds, yeast infections, or atypical nail dystrophy) and for immunocompromised patients with significant immunosuppression or complex comorbidities.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies, such as laser and photodynamic therapy [^1172Y3Lp], are currently **not recommended** because evidence for their efficacy and safety remains insufficient [^115XwZqP].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommended agents** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Systemic therapy | Moderate to severe onychomycosis | Terbinafine 250 mg daily [^114oMws9]; Itraconazole 200 mg daily or pulse [^112CywgH]; Fluconazole 150–450 mg weekly [^117BnDuN] | 12 weeks (terbinafine, itraconazole); ≥ 6 months (fluconazole) |
| Topical therapy | Mild to moderate onychomycosis | Efinaconazole 10% daily [^115bUy8N]; Ciclopirox 8% daily [^117FtDr9] | 48 weeks |
| Combination therapy | Severe or refractory cases | Systemic + topical therapy [^1147QjSw] | 12–48 weeks |

---

Effective management of toenail onychomycosis in primary care involves **accurate diagnosis** [^112cyXJs], appropriate choice of systemic or topical therapy, patient education, and regular follow-up. Systemic antifungal therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for moderate to severe cases [^1158mkjV], while topical therapy is suitable for mild cases or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^1127Qx9o]. Combination therapy is recommended for severe or refractory cases [^1147QjSw].

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis [^112pHtES]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains difficult to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents, and not all patients are cured. Clinical experience suggests that several host-related factors can affect the chance of cure, but studies supporting these observations are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly on topical agents, rely on severity classification for patient selection, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. Additionally, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

- **Objective**: To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

- **Methods**: A post hoc pooled analysis was conducted using two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies involving 1655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to receive efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week post-treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included achieving a clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement) or moderate (30%-39%).

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^111Uvffm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Secondary efficacy end-points focused on:

- **Changes over time in complete cure rate**: Complete cure was defined as a 0% clinical involvement of the target nail, with a negative potassium hydroxide examination result.

- **Changes over time in mycological cure rate**: Mycological cure was defined as a negative result in the potassium hydroxide examination of the target nail.

- **Changes over time in the decrease rate of clinical involvement**: Calculated using the following formula:
	- Decreased rate of clinical involvement = (clinical involvement at baseline − clinical involvement after application of EFCZ) / clinical involvement at baseline × 100.

	- As for the analysis items, efficacy was classified as follows to calculate the number of subjects and efficacy rate:
	- 75% or more, "remarkably improved"
	- 50% or more and less than 75%, "improved"
	- 25% or more and less than 50%, "moderately improved"
	- 0% or more and less than 25%, "unchanged"
	- Less than 0%, "aggravated".

- **Changes over time in clinical involvement**: Calculated using the following formula:
	- Changes in clinical involvement = clinical involvement at baseline − clinical involvement after application of EFCZ.

- **Changes in the increase rate of the unaffected nail area over time**: Defined as the rate of the "amount of increase in the unaffected nail area from before to after EFCZ application" against "the unaffected area at baseline" of the target nail, calculated with the following formula:
	- Increased rate of unaffected nail area = (unaffected nail area after application of…

### Prevention of onychomycosis reinfection for patients with complete cure of all 10 toenails: Results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study of prophylactic miconazole powder 2% [^113Qb8BK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving 48 participants was to determine if biweekly miconazole powder prevents onychomycosis recurrence. Intent-to-treat analysis found no significant differences in mycologic, clinical, or complete onychomycosis reinfection rates or time to reinfection. Limitations include small sample size and dosing regimen.

### Managing assessments and expectations: Patient responses following therapy with efinaconazole topical solution, 10% [^111nUh1S]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of onychomycosis is both a clinical and therapeutic challenge. Effective patient education and reassurance are critical. This post hoc analysis aims to provide some guidance to physicians based on initial disease severity and influencing factors.

- **Methods**: A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in mild to moderate onychomycosis. Outcomes were assessed based on baseline severity (20%-29%, 30%-39%, 40%-49%, and ≥ 50% affected target toenail).

- **Results**: Overall, the mean percent affected toenail following efinaconazole treatment decreased from 36.4% to 20.6%, representing a 43% reduction. The percent reduction in the mean percent affected toenail (range, 43.6% to 59.8%) with efinaconazole was similar irrespective of baseline severity. Improvement was only seen in the very mildest patients with the vehicle and not before week 36. Improvement was influenced by gender, with females doing better, and disease duration, as long-standing disease responded less well.

- **Conclusions**: Our onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole might expect a 50% improvement in their disease within a year, which will be seen as significant by many, especially those who have suffered for many years. Many will do better, but they need to be reminded of the slow growth of the toenail.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: A nationwide claims database study [^115E7KY2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The preference for topical medications among some practitioners may lie in the misconception by both patients and physicians that oral medications are dangerous. Recently, studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole in older patients, a population with a higher prevalence of onychomycosis and often considered at higher risk for adverse effects. These data consistently support the idea that oral medications, particularly terbinafine and fosravuconazole, are significantly more cost-effective than topical medications for the treatment of onychomycosis, with an acceptable safety profile. While topical medications may have a role in certain cases, the evidence supports oral medications as the first-line treatment for onychomycosis from both efficacy and cost-effectiveness perspectives.

- **Limitations**: This study had some limitations. First, the NDB Open Data Japan does not link prescription data with diagnoses, which may have led to the inclusion of prescriptions for indications other than onychomycosis; therefore, we focused on antifungal medications specifically indicated for onychomycosis treatment, such as efinaconazole, luliconazole (i.e. Luconac®), and fosravuconazole. Second, the lack of information on disease severity and treatment outcomes in the NDB Open Data Japan limits the interpretation of the appropriateness of the prescribing patterns of topical and oral medications. Thus, data from this study should be interpreted in conjunction with other studies that incorporate clinical data from electronic health records or surveys.

### Combination therapy for onychomycosis [^112D9kKM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION Study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort reported that after five years, only 46% of terbinafine-treated patients and 13% of itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections are common in long-term monotherapy for onychomycosis. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology. The strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments.

A number of specific drug combinations have proved useful in the treatment of onychomycosis, including:

- **Tioconazole and griseofulvin**
- **Amorolfine and griseofulvin**
- **Amorolfine and terbinafine**
- **Amorolfine and itraconazole**

However, comparison of these combination trials can be difficult due to the short duration of some studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors, it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages compared to monotherapy. Combination therapy can be administered sequentially or in parallel. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are likely to fail therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for those who show a poor response to initial treatment.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: Real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^112roHo6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

This research focuses on understanding the risk factors contributing to the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis, utilizing data derived from a large-scale database within a single-podiatry center in Japan. The study examines various patient demographics, medical history, and environmental factors to identify potential correlations with these conditions. The analysis revealed several notable associations:

- **Age and gender**: Older age and male gender were observed to have a higher prevalence of both tinea pedis and onychomycosis.
- **Medical history**: Patients with a history of diabetes or circulatory disorders demonstrated an increased risk of developing these conditions.
- **Environmental exposure**: Individuals frequently exposed to communal showers or locker rooms showed a higher incidence of infection.

The findings underscore the importance of recognizing these risk factors in clinical settings to better prevent and manage tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Despite these insights, the study's credibility is considered low, according to The Journal of Dermatology. Future research with more rigorous design is necessary to confirm these associations.

When evaluating surgical interventions for onychomycosis, specifically concerning nail debridement, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2014 guidelines advise against performing nail debridement alone as a treatment in patients with onychomycosis. It is recommended to consider mechanical intervention to remove the dermatophytomas within the nail plate or bed.

### Individual article: Updated review of topical pharmaceuticals and complementary and alternative medications for the treatment of onychomycosis in both general and special populations in the United States [^117SAvvE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a prevalent condition affecting both the United States and the global population. Treatment options are limited, with only three topical antifungal medications obtaining approval in the US within the last 25 years: ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole. The economic impact and quality of life burden due to onychomycosis are significant. This review provides an up-to-date examination of all approved topical antifungal therapies for toenail onychomycosis. It discusses treatment efficacy, pharmacology, and usage in special populations. Additionally, it explores evidence for complementary and alternative medicine.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: A nationwide claims database study [^117JT8Nm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Two recent studies have reported web-based surveys of prescription preferences of dermatologists for onychomycosis. Both studies showed an increase in the appropriate use of oral medications, yet also indicated that a considerable number of topical medications continue to be prescribed for patients with onychomycosis who are suitable for oral medications. Despite these valuable insights, no study has examined nationwide prescription trends in Japan, where primary care physicians manage a significant number of patients with dermatological disorders.

This study aimed to address the gap between the recommended antifungal treatments for onychomycosis and actual prescriptions in Japan. Using data from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB), this study analyzed prescription trends of antifungal treatments for onychomycosis from fiscal years 2014 to 2021. By examining the prescription patterns of both topical and oral antifungal medications, we investigated the impact of newly introduced medications on the trends, assessed the alignment of treatments with guidelines, and evaluated the associated medical costs.

### The effects of COlaser and topical agent combination therapy for onychomycosis: A meta-analysis [^115YqjNn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The routine options for onychomycosis are oral, topical, and device-based therapies, which are often limited in terms of efficacy and have unsatisfactory side effects. Topical agents such as luliconazole, tioconazole, terbinafine, and tazarotene can be more effective when combined with laser therapies. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and satisfaction rates of CO2 laser therapy with topical agents in patients with onychomycosis. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Ovid databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of combined therapies. Selected study data were analyzed for differences expressed as odds ratio (OR) and relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Efficacy and satisfaction outcomes were assessed using quantitative methods. Our investigations showed that combined CO2 laser and topical treatments significantly increased efficacy 5.38-fold when compared with topical agents alone (OR 5.38; 95% CI; 3.20–9.04; p < 0.00001), with low heterogeneity observed among studies (I² = 38%). Mycological clearance comparison rates were also improved by combined treatments. The higher satisfaction of the combined group was assessed by pooled effect (OR 4.56; 95% CI; 2.78–7.49; p < 0.00001). Our evidence suggests combined therapy may exert positive effects and satisfactory safety for patients with moderate to severe onychomycosis; however, optimal combination options and appropriate dosages require more comprehensive RCTs.

### Pulse versus continuous terbinafine for onychomycosis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^111DaRFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). High credibility.

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse), was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

- **Results**: Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs. 58.7% [84/143]; p = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); and clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs. 29.3% [42/143]; p = 0.007, RR = 1.52).

### Effect of onychomycosis and treatment on patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes: A systematic review [^111B3Tnp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, often causing physical, emotional, and aesthetic consequences. The effect of both the condition itself and treatment on quality of life has not been well studied. The objectives of this study were to systematically review the available literature describing the effect of onychomycosis and its treatment on quality of life.

- **Methods**: We performed a search of the onychomycosis literature published before April 13, 2020. Articles were included in the review if primary data were presented, patient-reported outcome measures were used, and onychomycosis was specifically examined.

- **Results**: Thirty studies were included in the final analysis. Poorest quality-of-life scores were associated with women and fingernail involvement. Quality-of-life scores improved from baseline with all treatment types; there were greater improvements reported with oral treatments compared with topical ones.

- **Conclusions**: This review affirms that onychomycosis significantly influences quality of life, warranting effective treatment. All treatments resulted in quality-of-life improvements; however, studies on oral and topical therapies were of higher quality than those evaluating devices. Increased efforts are needed to understand the effect of the disease and therapy as assessed by validated, nail-specific outcome measures that accurately assess patients' cosmetic, physical, and social difficulties.

### Therapies for the treatment of onychomycosis [^112QUz1v]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients confirm the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy, as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: A consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

- **Methods**: This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

- **Results**: The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on the percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care.

### Efinaconazole topical solution, 10%: The benefits of treating onychomycosis early [^115fZRgk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in onychomycosis patients with early and long-standing disease, an analysis was conducted on 1,655 patients aged 18–70 years. These patients were randomized to receive either efinaconazole topical solution, 10% or a vehicle in two identical multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 48-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy. The primary endpoint was the complete cure rate, defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target toenail and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture, at Week 52. Three groups were compared: those with early disease (less than 5 years) and those with long-standing disease (5 years or more).

The majority of patients had long-standing disease; they were predominantly older, male, and white. While nail involvement of the target toenail did not differ noticeably amongst the three groups, the number of nails involved increased progressively with disease duration. Differences in infecting pathogens in early disease may have important treatment implications. Efinaconazole was more effective in treating early disease, however more than 40% of patients with long-standing disease were considered treatment successes.

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis. It is important to treat onychomycosis early to prevent disease progression to other toenails. Once daily efinaconazole topical solution, 10% is particularly effective in these patients.

### Long-term follow-up study of onychomycosis: Cure rate and dropout rate with oral antifungal treatments [^115eu4nG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The "complete cure" of onychomycosis requires long-term treatment with a systemic antifungal agent; therefore, properly assessing the effects of an antifungal agent on onychomycosis requires a long follow-up. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the patients treated with griseofulvin (GRF) from 1962 to 1992 and a clinical study to compare the long-term effect of GRF with that of a new oral antifungal agent, itraconazole (ITCZ), for patients who received treatment from 1992 to 1995.

In the retrospective study, 281 patients who were microscopically diagnosed as having onychomycosis at the Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, and received GRF administration in 1962, 1972, 1982, and 1992, were evaluated for cure rate and dropout rate. The total cure rate was 29.2%, but the cure rate was 68.8% for the patients who continued their medication for more than one year.

For the comparative study, 139 patients who received treatment at the same institution between 1992 and 1995 were evaluated. The cure rate and dropout rate for GRF were 23.8% (23/97) and 52.6% (51/97), respectively. The cure rate and dropout rate for ITCZ were 50.0% (21/42) and 38.1% (15/42). When comparing the long-term effects of the two treatment protocols, we found that most patients treated with ITCZ were cured within three years, while about 30% of the patients treated with GRF remained uncured even after long-term administration of the agent. Furthermore, the GRF/ITCZ administration required from a multiple regression analysis.

### Onychomycosis treatment prescribed at only twenty percent of visits: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2007 to 2016 [^114Atcth]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis represents the highest proportion of nail disorders seen in clinical practice. Onychomycosis management may differ amongst specialties, impacting patient outcomes and quality of life (QoL).

- **Objective**: We aimed to characterize onychomycosis treatment across specialties, accounting for patient demographics, to assess potential onychomycosis practice gaps.

- **Materials/Methods**: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional analysis using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 2007 to 2016 (the most recent years available).

- **Results**: Overall, 71.6% of onychomycosis visits were with general practitioners (GPs), 25.8% with dermatologists, and 2.58% with pediatricians. No onychomycosis treatment was prescribed at 82.0% of dermatology visits and 78.9% of GP visits. Dermatologists (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.27 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): [2.14–2.41]; P < 0.0001) and GPs (OR: 2.32 [2.21–2.44]; P < 0.0001) were more likely than pediatricians to prescribe treatment versus no treatment. Dermatologists were more likely than GPs to prescribe no treatment versus treatment and topical versus oral antifungals (OR: 1.33 [1.16–1.52]; P < 0.0001 and OR: 4.20 [3.80–4.65]; P < 0.0001), respectively.

- **Discussion**: Our study showed that there is a low treatment rate for onychomycosis, with treatment prescribed at only 20% of visits. Untreated onychomycosis might result in secondary infection, pain, and negative QoL impact. Although dermatologists are specialists in nail disease management, they saw only about 25% of onychomycosis visits. Future efforts should be…

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158mkjV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds that account for approximately 50% of all nail-related diseases. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

- **Methods**: Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

- **Results**: Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality, while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

### Prospective efficacy and safety evaluation of laser treatments with real-time temperature feedback for fungal onychomycosis [^114VZVmY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis affects five percent of the worldwide population and presents a significant therapeutic challenge. Available therapies are often ineffective or require considerable patient monitoring. Researchers are investigating laser and light technologies as potential treatments for onychomycosis, although their mechanism of action remains unclear. It is hypothesized that the photothermal effect from water-absorbing lasers generates bulk heating in the nail plate, which may eradicate fungal hyphae. Thus, laser technology holds promise as a potential treatment option for onychomycosis. This study is a prospective trial utilizing real-time temperature feedback to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser therapy for onychomycosis.

Twenty-one patients with PAS or culture-proven fungal onychomycosis were prospectively treated with lasers until the target temperature of 46–48 degrees Celsius was achieved, using real-time infrared temperature feedback. The laser and light therapies employed included 1319 nm, 1064 nm, and BroadBand Light. Exclusion criteria were mixed infections and lack of other prior therapeutic interventions. Subjects received four treatment sessions one week apart, with assessments including PAS and cultures at one, three, and six months post-treatment. During treatment, patients rated their pain on a scale from 1 to 10.

Patients tolerated the procedures well, reporting high satisfaction. The average treatment time was 10 minutes, with no adverse events noted. Patients reported mild to moderate transient discomfort during treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate, a novel oral triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of onychomycosis: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^111AVDyZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The main inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (i) 20 years or older but less than 75 years of age; (ii) clinical involvement in either the left or right great toenail; (iii) positive potassium hydroxide examination results under direct microscopy and confirmed detection of Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes by loop-mediated isothermal amplification, a method proven to have a high correlation with fungal culture in the identification of T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes, prior to this study [Dr Shinichi Watanabe, 2013, unpubl. data]; (iv) clinical involvement affecting 25% or more of the toenail; and (v) the provision of written informed consent.

The main exclusion criteria applied to patients were as follows: (i) use of any oral or injectable antifungal agent or topical antifungal agent for nails within 36 weeks before the first administration of the study drug; (ii) longitudinal streaks or a spike in the toenail with clinical involvement to be evaluated (target toenail); (iii) clinical involvement reaching the proximal nail fold of the target toenail; (iv) dermatophytes detected only on the nail surface (superficial white onychomycosis); or (v) significant nail thickening or deformity due to onychogryphosis or other conditions.

During the study period, subjects were prohibited from using any oral or topical antifungal agent other than the study drug or other therapies for onychomycosis such as surgical removal of an affected nail. No drugs were prohibited from concomitant use from the viewpoint of drug interactions.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^117BJe2v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This study clarifies the new efficacy of efinaconazole (EFCZ) in subjects with onychomycosis and suggests higher safety. These properties may expand the potential of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

However, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ. Therefore, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments should be considered. Reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances therapeutic efficacy. Further studies on such cases are expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may currently be at a turning point globally. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis to fungal superinfection: Prevention strategies and considerations [^114tHTyi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common fungal skin infection and is frequently observed alongside other fungal infections, with tinea pedis being the most prevalent. Infected nails serve as a reservoir for fungal organisms that can infect the skin and might also become infected by it. Early and effective treatment of the nails is crucial to prevent not only permanent structural damage but also the spread and superinfection of surrounding skin and soft tissue. Furthermore, treating the skin is essential to prevent the re-infection of the nails.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^116NHpM1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, using therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral, or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments.

With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance. In cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid the potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^115AppQy]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statistical analyses**: The target subjects in the study were categorized as follows:

	- **Full analysis set**: This group included the population meeting the inclusion criteria and possessing positive fungus cultures. It excluded subjects without evaluation data after the efinaconazole application.
	- **Per protocol set**: This consisted of the population of target subjects who adhered to the clinical study protocol.

- **Methods of analysis**: The primary analysis involved the full analysis set, while supplemental analysis incorporated the per protocol set. The final observation time, including any discontinuation time, was designated as the final assessment time point.

For each evaluation parameter, subgroup analysis was pre-determined based on patient background, such as sex, age, type of onychomycosis, clinical involvement, and causative fungal species. Given that the study was a single-group trial, hypothesis testing was not conducted. Statistical methods were utilized where continuous data were expressed as summary statistics, including the number of subjects, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and minimum/median/maximum values with 95% confidence intervals. Categorical data were represented by the number of subjects and proportions. Missing values (excluding the QOL scores) were addressed using the last observation carried forward method; QOL scores were not supplemented.

Continuous data from the outcomes and discussion of this report are articulated as mean ± standard deviation, except where stated otherwise. Safety analysis was not conducted. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS® System Release 9.4.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^1164x52o]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in the mycological cure rate increased earlier than the treatment success and complete cure rates, rising to 38.8% at week 24, 50.7% at week 36, and 55.3% at week 72 after starting efinaconazole (EFCZ) application. The mycological cure rate at the final assessment was 61.6%. The same trend was observed in the patient populations with clinical involvement of 20–50% and more than 50%, with increases of up to 66.9% and 52.5%, respectively, at the final assessment.

Changes in clinical involvement began to rise to 11.1% ± 13.27% (with initial clinical involvement at 49.1% ± 23.14%) from week 12 after starting EFCZ application, reaching up to 21.0% ± 18.40% at week 24 and then 31.9% ± 24.32% at week 72. In the subject population with a clinical involvement of 20–50%, the clinical involvement at the start of EFCZ therapy was 33.6% ± 9.98%, with a change in clinical involvement of 21.6% ± 16.90% at week 72. In the subject population with more than 50% affected nail area, the clinical involvement at the start of EFCZ therapy was 75.9% ± 12.27%, showing greater increases in clinical involvement area of 17.1% ± 15.16% at week 12, 32.7% ± 19.08% at week 24, and 49.9% ± 24.88% at week 72.

The results of subgroup analysis of the complete cure rate, mycological cure rate, and changes in clinical involvement are illustrated in the findings.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^1116pzTv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in the complete cure rate in the full analysis set were confirmed to increase over time until week 72 after starting EFCZ application, similar to the treatment success rate, achieving 31.1% at the final assessment. The complete cure rate in both patient populations with clinical involvement of 20–50% and more than 50% was also confirmed to increase over time, to 34.5% and 25.0%, respectively.

- **Secondary end-points**:
	- **Complete cure rates**: Changes in the complete cure rate are shown according to severity from the start of efinaconazole 10% solution application to the final assessment. Complete cure was defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target nail, with a negative potassium hydroxide examination result. The complete cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.
	- **Mycological cure rate**: Changes in the mycological cure rate are shown according to severity from the start of application to the final assessment. Mycological cure was defined as a negative result in the potassium hydroxide examination of the target nail. The mycological cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.
	- **Changes in clinical involvement over time**: Changes in clinical involvement are shown according to severity from the start of application to the final assessment. The changes in clinical involvement showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.
	- **Decrease rate of clinical involvement**: Changes in the decrease rate of clinical involvement for various severity levels also showed notable improvement over time.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^112NihLt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2018 as a multicenter, open‐label, single‐arm study in 36 facilities nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with severe (> 50% clinical involvement) onychomycosis and the efficacy of long‐term use of efinaconazole 10% solution (EFCZ) for more than 1 year. We also obtained information on patient quality of life with EFCZ therapy. The study was conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects, with the approval of the appropriate ethics committee. Upon participating in the research, all the patients were given a written explanation of the study before they provided written informed consent.

The subjects included in the study were male or female patients aged 20 years or older (at the time of informed consent) who provided written consent and were diagnosed with onychomycosis in either the left or right great toenail (target nail). The lesion should be definitely diagnosed using a potassium hydroxide examination, with 20% or more clinical involvement of the affected great toenail (not reaching the proximal nail fold), and the growth of the target nail (requiring nail clipping at least once a month) should be confirmed by consultation (regardless of the nail thickness). If both the left and right great toenails were affected, the target nail with the larger clinical involvement was selected. In case the clinical involvement was of the same size, the right nail was chosen.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: Factors contributing to recurrence [^112dVcoD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years, allowing many patients to expect a complete and lasting cure. However, persistent disease remains a problem for up to 25% of patients, posing a particular challenge to clinicians. For these patients, it is crucial to ensure a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis, as misdiagnosis can jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumors, vascular disorders, and inflammatory diseases.

- **Predisposing factors**: These include a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease, and yellow spikes, which contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy. Poor penetration of systemic agents to the center of infection or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below probably also contributes to treatment challenges.

- **Factors contributing to recurrence**: These may relate to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle, or underlying physiology. Additionally, patients with concomitant diseases such as peripheral vascular disease or diabetes, and those who are immunosuppressed (e.g. individuals with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60%, and it increases with age.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^112reb1J]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

In our study, the treatment success rate, in terms of the primary endpoint (≤ 10% clinical involvement), was 56.6% in the eligible patients after applying efinaconazole (EFCZ) for up to 72 weeks. In the multinational phase III study for EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis who had 20–50% area of nail involvement, the treatment success rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with less than 10% area of nail involvement. The treatment success rate was 31.0%, and in the subgroup analysis of the Japanese population, this rate was 46.7% after 48 weeks of application, assessed at week 52. Considering that the definitions of treatment success are slightly different in a precise sense and that our study included not only patients with distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) but also those with superficial white onychomycosis (SWO), an equitable comparison is not possible. However, when comparing only with the population with an affected area of 20–50%, a similar trend of 57.6% at week 48 was obtained in our study.

### Long-term follow-up of onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole [^113uW4Rd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains difficult to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents. Clinical trials on efinaconazole and tavaborole included 48 weeks' daily treatment regimens with a 4-week follow-up. It has been suggested that either a longer treatment regimen or longer follow-up would lead to even better results, primarily due to the time taken for the diseased nail to grow out, especially in those patients with more severe disease.

- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of a longer follow-up period on the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in patients with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: A single center, open-labeled study in 23 subjects aged 18–80 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of moderate-to-severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (40–75% clinical involvement). Subjects were treated with efinaconazole 10% solution, once daily for 48 weeks, with two 12-week post-treatment follow-ups (at week 60 and 72). The primary efficacy endpoint was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture). Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure rates and treatment success (defined as those patients who had at least a 50% improvement in the affected toenail from baseline).

- **Results**: Twenty-two subjects completed the study. The mean baseline age was 59.4 years (range, 37–77), with a predominance of male subjects (73.9%). The median baseline severity was 50% affected target toenail. At week 72, two subjects were complete cures and 56.5% of subjects achieved [text appears cut off].

### Onychomycosis: Burden of disease and the role of topical antifungal treatment [^115DffSc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. It is a common disorder that may be a reservoir of infection and lead to significant medical problems. Additionally, onychomycosis may cause a substantial decrease in quality of life. An understanding of the disorder and updated management is important for all health care professionals. Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder in adults, occurring four to seven times more frequently in toenails, where it often involves several nails.

This progressive disease, although not life-threatening, is inappropriately considered purely a cosmetic problem, with some physicians still believing there is no need to treat it. The fungal infection usually begins in the nail bed and often extends to the nail plate. Onychomycosis is unsightly and can be uncomfortable, with discoloration of the nail plate. In more severe cases, there is loss of the nail plate altogether. It may become a source of more widespread fungal lesions, spreading to other nails, body sites (such as the groin, skin, and scalp), and even to family members.

### Clinical effectiveness of efinaconazole 10% solution for treatment of onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes [^116XJ4mL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease in daily medical practice and affects approximately 10% of the population in Japan. The disease types of onychomycosis are classified by the fungal entry route. According to the Japanese guidelines, they are classified into the following five types: (i) distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO); (ii) superficial white onychomycosis; (iii) proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO); (iv) endonyx onychomycosis; and (v) total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO). In addition, there may be specific disease types such as onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes (yellow or white linear affected area) or onychomycosis with dermatophytoma (round circumscribed yellow or white patch) in the nail plate. Recently, DLSO with a V-shaped affected area at the tip of the nail has been referred to as "wedge shape" in Japan. However, it is considered a normal manifestation in DLSO and is different from longitudinal spikes.

In daily clinical practice, oral antifungal drugs are effective in many cases. However, longitudinal spikes or dermatophytoma have been reported to be refractory to oral drugs. Therefore, in previous clinical trials for onychomycosis, these disease types were excluded. However, since the launch of the 10% efinaconazole solution (EFCZ) as the first topical therapeutic agent for onychomycosis in Japan, some cases with longitudinal spikes have responded to EFCZ.

Using the data from the study by Iozumi et al, where longitudinal spikes were not excluded, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of EFCZ in onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: How to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs.

- **Patient-related factors**: Physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely.
- **Organism-focused factors**: It is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective.
- **Treatment strategies**: Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit.

Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Toenail onychomycosis: Current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting approximately 8% of the general population. The treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, characterized by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine due to its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole may be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies can be a useful adjunct to systemic therapies but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^116JnbqP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Among the 40 subjects (18.3%) who discontinued EFCZ therapy during the study, only 11 (5.0%) stopped due to adverse events and two (0.9%) because of aggravation of the underlying disease. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 6.4%, all of which were local site reactions that resolved after discontinuation or during application. No increase was observed in adverse drug reactions during long-term use, indicating potential for sustained treatment without safety concerns.

The prevalence of onychomycosis in the elderly is high; thus, safety requires attention. Our study included 53.9% elderly patients aged 65 years or more, higher than the 23.4% in the Japanese population from the multinational phase III study, due to our study's reflecting actual clinical practice. Subgroup analysis showed similar outcomes for non-elderly patients aged less than 65 years and elderly patients aged 65 years or more, indicating comparable efficacy for both groups. Many elderly patients take multiple drugs, complicating oral treatment choice due to drug interactions and adverse reactions. In such cases, EFCZ is expected to have a similar effect in both demographics.

The British Association of Dermatologists' 2014 guidelines recommend offering itraconazole for the medical management of onychomycosis, especially regarding systemic antifungals. The prescribed dosage is 200 mg/day for 12 weeks continuously, or alternatively, as pulse therapy at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 week per month. For pulse therapy, two pulses are recommended for fingernails and three pulses for toenails.

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2014 guidelines for the management of onychomycosis discuss the use of systemic antifungals. They suggest offering griseofulvin (500–1,000 mg/day for 6–9 months for fingernail infection and 12–18 months for toenail infection; taken with fatty food to increase absorption) as an alternative option. However, they recognize that griseofulvin has lower efficacy and higher relapse rates compared to terbinafine and itraconazole.

### Drug synergies and the potential for combination therapy in onychomycosis [^115R2qjp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Synergy between antifungal drugs is well recognized. However, combinations of antifungals are yet to be widely adopted to treat onychomycosis. The rationale for the combination of topical and oral therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis is that the systemic antifungal reaches the infection area via the nail bed, and the topical agent is absorbed through the nail surface. The combination of antifungals used should ideally be synergistic in their mode of action.

Synergy between amorolfine and other antifungals has been demonstrated in vitro. This is presumably due to differences in the precise point of action of the drugs on the fungal cell membrane, where they inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol. Thus, combinations can result in increased antifungal activity at lower concentrations of both drugs. The potential exists, therefore, for combinations of antifungals to achieve higher cure rates in onychomycosis in a shorter time than is currently possible. This approach warrants further investigation.

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^116P8zSy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit and is the most common of the nail disorders. Therapies for onychomycosis have less than ideal efficacy and have the potential for adverse effects. As previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of *Trichophyton rubrum*, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis. The primary endpoint was the safety of the device, and the secondary outcome measures were clinical efficacy and mycological cure. Patient satisfaction was measured using questionnaires at the completion of the study.

All but one patient met the primary endpoint of safety, and there were no long-term sequelae. The overall clinical cure was 53.8% and the mycological cure was 15.4%. The majority of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12–18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines and consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than five years ago, and updated medical guidance is needed.

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

- **Methods**: There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment, and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This article provides important updates to previous guidelines and consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^1146vjAy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. This disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis, highlighting the necessity and desirability of patient treatment.

The etiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis are under increasing scrutiny, with significant advancements in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can prescribe treatment, confident of improvement for the majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps 25–40% of those in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis, and severe disease.

These observations have led to renewed interest in combination treatments for patients at risk of failure or relapse. Several types of combinations can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a role in treating onychomycosis.

### Clinical effectiveness of efinaconazole 10% solution for treatment of onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes [^112y5kS6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

This was a retrospective study to investigate data from the research conducted by Iozumi et al. after the end of the observation period. An ethical review was conducted at each study site, and approval was obtained. This study was conducted in compliance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects. Information on the study, including its objectives, was notified or disclosed, and opportunities for refusal were secured as much as possible. From the study by Iozumi et al, patients who were assessed to have onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes based on the images taken at the start date of the study by both the medical expert and the investigator of the study site were included.

- **Assessment and fixation of onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes**: In this study, onychomycosis with a yellow or white linear affected area was defined as onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes. We defined a longitudinal spike as a clinical manifestation of longitudinal linear opacity; however, the fungal histological findings, such as a dense mass of dermatophytes, were not confirmed. The medical expert evaluated whether the masked images of onychomycosis at the start of the study corresponded to the definition. Subsequently, the investigator at each site assessed whether the image at the start of the study corresponded to the definition of patients at their site. When the assessments by the medical expert and the investigator were the same, it was recorded as the assessment result.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^113CScMT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have fewer serious side effects, yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article provides an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

- **Study design/materials and methods**: A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

- **Results**: Early data are promising; however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

- **Conclusion**: Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Onychomycosis diagnosis and management: Perspectives from a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable [^117UpkWy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other significant risk factors increase. Until recently, treatment options were limited due to safety concerns with oral antifungals and low efficacy with available topical agents. Efinaconazole and tavaborole were approved by the FDA in 2014 for onychomycosis treatment and provide additional effective topical treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate disease.

Dermatologists and podiatrists both regularly treat onychomycosis, yet there are striking differences between specialties in their approach to diagnosis and treatment. To explore these differences, a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable of onychomycosis experts was convened. Although it has little effect on mycologic cure, debridement may be a valuable adjunct to oral or topical antifungal therapy, especially in patients with a greater symptom burden. However, few dermatologists incorporate debridement into their treatment plans, and referral to podiatry may be appropriate for some of these patients.

Furthermore, podiatrists may be better equipped to manage patients with conditions like diabetes or peripheral vascular disease and elderly patients who are unable to maintain proper foot hygiene. Once a cure is achieved, lifestyle and hygiene practices, maintenance/prophylactic onychomycosis treatment, and proactive tinea pedis treatment in patients and family members may help to maintain patients' cured status.

### Cost-effectiveness of confirmatory testing before treatment of onychomycosis [^115rAxDM]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common disease of the nail in adults. International guidelines urge health care professionals to perform confirmatory diagnostic testing before initiating systemic therapy. This approach was determined to be cost-effective in studies from the late 1990s but has not been evaluated more recently. The effect of testing on the costs of efinaconazole, 10%, topical solution treatment is unknown.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the cost and potential harm associated with three approaches to onychomycosis evaluation before treatment with oral terbinafine or efinaconazole, 10%.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A decision analysis compared the costs of three onychomycosis management algorithms based on recently published data of test statistics, disease prevalence, and relevant costs: (1) empirical therapy without confirmatory testing, (2) pretreatment confirmatory testing with potassium hydroxide (KOH) stain followed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) evaluation if KOH testing is negative, and (3) pretreatment testing with PAS. There was no direct patient evaluation. Selection of included studies was based on outcome variables and the quality of study design. The study was conducted from April 1, 2014, to September 1, 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes included direct cost of onychomycosis testing and therapy and cost to avoid harm when treating patients with oral terbinafine.

Results indicate that at a disease prevalence of 75%, per-patient cost savings of empirical terbinafine therapy without confirmatory testing was $47 compared with the KOH screening.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^111gxmVu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Our study was an open‐label, single‐arm study. A simple comparison in terms of efficacy with the multinational phase III study (randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled parallel‐group study) may cause misjudgment; thus, caution is necessary. However, the evaluation parameters for efficacy in our study had similar results as those in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study. As for the subgroup analysis, data from the full analysis set were categorized according to patient background. Their uniformity and appropriateness were not examined; thus, the interpretation of the results should be made carefully.

As no control group was included in our study, objective information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions was not obtainable. However, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was low, and compared with the multinational phase III study, our study had a higher proportion of elderly patients. Therefore, we consider that the findings obtained in this study were comparable with those in the actual clinical setting.

This study was conducted at the 36 sites listed below: Department of Dermatology, Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital; Sapporo Skin Clinic; Ito Skin Clinic; Uesugi Dermatology Clinic; Asanuma Dermatology Clinic; Eniwa Station Dermatology Clinic; Kato Dermatology Clinic; Megumino Dermatologic Clinic; Takagi Dermatological Clinic; Takeda Dermatological Skin Care Clinic; Nopporo Dermatology Clinic; Showa Skin Clinic; Department of Dermatology, Asahikawa Medical University Hospital; Chitose Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Clinic.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^114K4GYx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering fluconazole (3–6 mg/kg once weekly for 12–16 weeks for fingernail infection and 18–26 weeks for toenail infection) as second-line therapy. This is suggested if itraconazole and terbinafine are contraindicated or not tolerated in pediatric patients (aged 1–12 years) with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is important to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). Monitoring LFTs is advised in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^1179TFEz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole.

- **Objectives**: A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent, we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs versus open studies.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole, and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration, and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent).

- **Results**: There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs, the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 ± 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 ± 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients).

### Onychomycosis: Treatment and prevention of recurrence [^111Aifqk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast. It is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series.

In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^115Hr4QH]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The results of our study suggest solutions for two issues with efinaconazole (EFCZ) therapy: the necessity for application over a period exceeding one year, and its applicability to severe cases where more than 50% of the area is affected.

In guidelines for onychomycosis treatment, topical drugs are recommended at the early stages of distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) or superficial white onychomycosis (SWO). Although oral therapy is advised for severe cases, it presents challenges for older patients or those with underlying diseases, due to potential drug interactions and polypharmacy. As a result, topical drugs are frequently administered to severe cases in clinical practice. Our study outcomes demonstrate the potential of EFCZ as a viable treatment option for severe cases.

Analysis by clinical type was also conducted in our study. Unlike DLSO, where the fungus enters underneath the distal part of the nail, in SWO, the fungus grows on the nail's surface layer. Thus, topical treatment on the surface is more effective in SWO cases than in DLSO cases. In SWO, the fungus is localized on the surface layer of the nail, making it more susceptible to topical EFCZ application. Efinaconazole was developed to permeate the nail plate, enhancing its action and applicability on nails. Our study observed a high efficacy rate in DLSO, similar to SWO, indicating EFCZ's high permeability in the nail plate.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trial registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

- **Main results**: We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 weeks.

### Validity of self-reported nail counts in patients with onychomycosis: A retrospective pilot analysis [^111bjDG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails, is common, affecting up to 8% of the general population. Telephone and mailed surveys conducted to study this disease are usually completed via patient self-report. However, the validity of the counts of diseased nails reported by the patients participating in these surveys has not been established.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to assess the interrater agreement between patient and healthcare professional (HCP) counts of affected nails in patients with onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: Patient and HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails corresponding to a total of 567 patients from three different clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed. All these patients were initially classified as mycologically positive for toenail onychomycosis, and all three trials used identical self-administered questions regarding counts of infected toenails and fingernails. The level of agreement between patient versus HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails (based on collapsed and uncollapsed counts) was measured using the quadratically weighted kappa statistic.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight percent (213/554, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 43%) of the 554 patients with self-reported and HCP counts of infected toenails had exact agreement; for these 554 patients, quadratically weighted kappa = 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.54). The highest agreement rates — 79%, 62%, and 50% — correspond to the patients with HCP counts of affected toenails equaling 1, 2, and 10, respectively; that is, HCP counts at the extremes.
