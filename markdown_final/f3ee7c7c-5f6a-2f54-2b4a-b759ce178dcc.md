## Question

55 yo F with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis and chronic kidney disease (eGFR 32) presents with acute ulnar neuropathy; she is on methotrexate 15 mg weekly, folic acid, and currently taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for a recent UTI. Neurology recommends starting high-dose oral prednisone (60 mg daily) for suspected vasculitic neuropathy. Start prednisone as recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to start high-dose oral prednisone (60 mg daily) for suspected vasculitic neuropathy in a 55-year-old woman with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease with eGFR 32, and current methotrexate and TMP-SMX use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether vasculitic neuropathy is likely. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care treatment for vasculitic neuropathy and whether 60 mg prednisone is appropriate. Next, I will examine drug–drug interactions, especially methotrexate with TMP-SMX and how prednisone changes that risk. After that, I need to check kidney-specific issues, including dosing and infection prophylaxis. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus risks and outline a practical, safer plan with monitoring and contingencies, including when to escalate therapy or obtain biopsy confirmation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. Acute painful mononeuropathy in RA raises vasculitic neuropathy as a leading consideration, and vasculitic neuropathy typically presents with painful, asymmetric sensory-motor deficits from ischemic nerve injury; prompt recognition matters because delays increase axonal loss and disability, so I should not under-treat while waiting for perfect confirmation if the pretest probability is high and the patient is deteriorating [^5cfa69d5] [^09cb8077].

> Now, I should verify the treatment standard. High-dose glucocorticoids are first-line for vasculitic neuropathy, with typical regimens using prednisone around 1 mg/kg/day (often capped at 60–80 mg/day) or IV methylprednisolone pulses for severe disease; this aligns with vasculitis guidelines and reviews, so 60 mg daily is within the evidence-based range for suspected vasculitic neuropathy, especially if there is motor involvement or rapid progression [^09cb8077] [^746f18cb] [^75110dfe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check the methotrexate–TMP-SMX interaction. TMP-SMX inhibits renal tubular secretion of methotrexate and can cause bone marrow suppression, and this risk is magnified in CKD; multiple sources flag this as a clinically meaningful interaction, so continuing both TMP-SMX and methotrexate while adding high-dose prednisone meaningfully increases cytopenia and infection risk, and I should act to mitigate that before escalating immunosuppression [^57ba47ed] [^b66dbd77] [^6fbd151c].

> Wait, let me verify the kidney-specific dosing and prophylaxis issues. In CKD G4, TMP-SMX should be dose-reduced by about 50% for treatment, and for Pneumocystis prophylaxis the usual dose is lower and must be adjusted to renal function; importantly, when prednisone is ≥ 20 mg/day for a month or more, PJP prophylaxis is recommended, so I need to ensure appropriate prophylaxis if I proceed with high-dose steroids and also reconcile TMP-SMX exposure from the UTI treatment [^84dfaf9c] [^fe2931a3] [^62c19df2].

> I should double-check the infection risk calculus. High-dose glucocorticoids increase risks of serious infections including bacterial, opportunistic, and PJP, and in immunocompromised hosts this risk is front-loaded in the first months; thus, if I start 60 mg prednisone, I need concurrent PJP prophylaxis and vigilant infection surveillance, and I should minimize concurrent myelosuppressive exposures where possible [^fe2931a3] [^62c19df2] [^1ac11b8d].

> Let me consider the methotrexate dilemma carefully. Methotrexate at 15 mg/week is standard for RA, but in CKD G4 the exposure is higher and toxicity risk rises; guidelines support using the lowest effective methotrexate dose and adjusting for renal function, and some clinicians hold or reduce methotrexate when adding high-dose steroids or when interacting drugs like TMP-SMX are necessary, balancing RA control against infection and cytopenia risk [^8813d3ac] [^ed8400df].

> I will now examine a safer, stepwise plan. First, I should confirm the diagnosis and severity with urgent EMG/NCS and consider nerve and muscle biopsy if feasible, because combined biopsy increases diagnostic yield in suspected vasculitis; second, I should stop TMP-SMX now and substitute the UTI therapy with a non-interacting agent such as nitrofurantoin if appropriate for the organism and renal function, or beta-lactams if needed; third, I should reduce methotrexate to 10 mg weekly or hold it temporarily while starting prednisone; fourth, I should initiate PJP prophylaxis with dose-adjusted TMP-SMX or an alternative if sulfa is contraindicated; finally, I should start high-dose prednisone at 60 mg daily with a planned taper once improvement is established, and monitor closely for infection, glucose, blood pressure, and bone health [^4126df99] [^84dfaf9c] [^fe2931a3] [^75110dfe].

> But wait, what if the neuropathy is not vasculitic or is mild. If the presentation is atypical or improving spontaneously, I should reconsider the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary steroids; non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy is a diagnosis of exclusion and often requires biopsy confirmation, and in less severe or uncertain cases, a lower steroid dose or observation with close follow-up may be reasonable while the workup proceeds [^fdee7b35] [^5cfa69d5].

> I should confirm escalation triggers. If there is rapid progression, multiple mononeuropathies, or systemic features suggesting severe vasculitis, IV methylprednisolone pulses and addition of a steroid-sparing agent such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide may be indicated; vasculitis guidelines support pulse steroids for organ- or life-threatening disease and emphasize individualized decisions for adding cytotoxic therapy based on severity and risk tolerance [^746f18cb] [^f80d5678].

> In summary, yes, I should start high-dose prednisone for suspected vasculitic neuropathy, but not before I mitigate the methotrexate–TMP-SMX interaction and institute PJP prophylaxis; the net benefit of timely steroid therapy for vasculitic neuropathy outweighs risks when managed carefully, and delays risk irreversible deficits, so I will proceed with 60 mg prednisone daily alongside TMP-SMX cessation, methotrexate dose reduction or hold, and appropriate PJP prophylaxis, with close monitoring and a plan to taper once controlled [^09cb8077] [^57ba47ed] [^fe2931a3] [^75110dfe].

---

Start high-dose prednisone **only after stopping TMP-SMX** because of the high risk of severe methotrexate toxicity from impaired renal clearance and additive myelosuppression [^57ba47ed] [^b66dbd77]. If vasculitic neuropathy is strongly suspected, begin prednisone **after TMP-SMX is discontinued** and consider PJP prophylaxis with an alternative agent (e.g. atovaquone) given the immunosuppression risk [^fe2931a3]. Monitor CBC, renal function, and LFTs closely, and reassess the need for biopsy if the diagnosis is uncertain [^4126df99].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting high-dose prednisone for vasculitic neuropathy

High-dose glucocorticoids are **first-line therapy** for vasculitic neuropathy, with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (typically 40–60 mg/day) or IV methylprednisolone 500–1,000 mg/day for 3–5 days, followed by oral prednisone taper [^746f18cb] [^09cb8077]. This approach reduces inflammation, prevents further nerve ischemia, and improves neurological outcomes [^5cfa69d5].

---

## Risks associated with high-dose prednisone in CKD

High-dose prednisone carries **significant risks** in CKD, including:

- **Infection risk**: Increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) [^fe2931a3] [^62c19df2].

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.

- **Bone health**: Osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.

- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, anxiety, and insomnia.

---

## Interaction between methotrexate and TMP-SMX

TMP-SMX **significantly increases methotrexate toxicity** by inhibiting renal tubular secretion and competing for the same transporters, leading to elevated methotrexate levels and severe myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, and renal failure [^57ba47ed] [^b66dbd77]. This risk is amplified in CKD, where methotrexate clearance is already reduced [^8813d3ac].

---

## Recommended management strategy

Given the significant risks, the following **stepwise approach** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Immediately discontinue TMP-SMX | Reduce risk of severe methotrexate toxicity [^57ba47ed] [^b66dbd77] |
| 2 | Monitor CBC, renal function, and LFTs closely | Detect early myelosuppression, renal, and hepatic toxicity [^b66dbd77] |
| 3 | Consider alternative antibiotic for UTI (e.g. nitrofurantoin, cephalexin) | Treat infection while avoiding methotrexate interaction [^notfound] |
| 4 | If vasculitic neuropathy is strongly suspected, initiate high-dose prednisone (60 mg/day) after TMP-SMX is discontinued | Treat vasculitic neuropathy while minimizing interaction risk [^09cb8077] [^746f18cb] |
| 5 | Consider PJP prophylaxis (e.g. atovaquone) given immunosuppression risk | Prevent opportunistic infections [^fe2931a3] [^62c19df2] |
| 6 | Reassess need for nerve biopsy if diagnosis remains uncertain | Confirm diagnosis and guide therapy [^4126df99] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

High-dose prednisone is indicated for suspected vasculitic neuropathy, but **start it only after stopping TMP-SMX** to mitigate methotrexate toxicity. Monitor closely for adverse effects and consider PJP prophylaxis. If the diagnosis is uncertain, obtain a nerve biopsy to confirm vasculitis before committing to prolonged high-dose steroids [^4126df99].

### An update on the classification and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy [^09cb8077]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Vasculitic neuropathy usually presents with painful mononeuropathies or an asymmetric polyneuropathy of acute or subacute onset. The disorder should be classified as being systemic or non-systemic. Systemic vasculitis should be further classified into one of the primary and secondary forms. Although specific treatment regimens vary among neurologists, basic principles can be applied. Corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for most forms of vasculitic neuropathy. Here we discuss dosing, potential side-effects, and management recommendations of conventional treatments. New treatments showing promise include intravenous immunoglobulin and biological agents and trials of the newest treatments are being reviewed. Future trials should compare commonly used treatment regimens and better establish the efficacy of newer, potentially safer, treatments.

### A family physician's guide to monitoring methotrexate… [^b66dbd77]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The use of methotrexate in the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis dates from the 1960s. 1, 2 From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, many rheumatologists were reporting their experiences with methotrexate use in studies of rheumatoid arthritis. 2 Guidelines for methotrexate use were then developed to address dosing, liver biopsy and monitoring strategies, which were aimed at reducing the incidence of adverse effects. Minor toxic effects such as stomatitis, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and mild alopecia are not life threatening but occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients. Other effects in this category include fatigue, mood alteration, dizziness, fever, myalgias and polyarthralgia. Most minor toxic effects are associated with depletion of folate. Folate supplementation with 1 mg daily or 7 mg once weekly should be considered for all patients. 8 Studies show that low-dose folate does not interfere with the efficacy of methotrexate.

9 Most rheumatologists advise patients to avoid taking the folate dose on the same day as the methotrexate dose. Often, minor toxic effects respond to a reduction in the methotrexate dose or an adjustment in the dosing schedule. Rheumatoid nodules may also increase in size during methotrexate therapy, despite good control of the disease process. 10 Major toxic effects of methotrexate, such as hepatic, renal, pulmonary and bone marrow disorders, occur less frequently than the minor effects but may be life threatening. HEPATOTOXICITY Although not appreciably metabolized, methotrexate concentrates in the liver. Abnormal liver histology appears to be more common in patients with psoriasis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. 7 Patients may experience a range of liver problems from mild fatty infiltrate to moderate or severe fibrosis, necrosis and cirrhosis.

8 Hepatotoxic effects are associated with long-term use and high doses of methotrexate and are common in patients taking a daily dose, which is never advisable.
7. Monitoring of serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum albumin levels is recommended for all patients receiving methotrexate. 8 These laboratory assessments were correlated with serious liver disorders in a mail survey of rheumatologists. 11 Approximately 30 percent of all patients on long-term therapy have AST elevation. Values exceeding two times the normal level for a period of one month warrant discontinuation of therapy.
7. Because liver function tests do not always predict hepatotoxic effects from methotrexate use, a liver biopsy may be indicated under the following circumstances in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: persistent elevation in liver enzymes; abnormal results in five of nine determinations of AST levels within a 12-month period; and a decrease in serum albumin values below the normal range.

7 Symptoms include persistent dry, nonproductive cough, dyspnea or both. Patients may also have fever. Pulmonary toxicity is unrelated to the cumulative dose and has occurred in early and late stages of therapy. 7 In one case-control study, increased age was the strongest predictor of lung injury. 15 The clinical trials have revealed a higher incidence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in those with psoriasis. 13 Pulmonary toxicity is also associated with a divided weekly dose regimen rather than a full weekly dose regimen.
13. BONE MARROW TOXICITY Bone marrow effects are rare but are associated with the following conditions: high doses of methotrexate, underlying renal disease, infection, folate deficiency, increased age, low albumin and concurrent use of trimethoprim. Monitoring signs of myelosuppression can reduce complications such as severe anemia, potential bleeding and sepsis.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^fe2931a3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): PJP prophylaxis should be used when the annual incidence of PJP for a given disease and treatment modality is ≥ 3.5%. For neuromuscular disease (NMD) receiving glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy where disease-specific incidence is unknown, prophylaxis may be offered to patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month; if a second immunosuppressive agent is added, prophylaxis should be offered for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month. Trimethoprim‑Sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) one single‑strength tablet daily or one double‑strength tablet three times a week is the recommended regimen for PJP prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, adjusted for renal function. For TMP‑SMX allergy, alternative options include atovaquone 1.5g daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly.

### Has the time come for routine trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis in patients taking biologic therapies? [^ec7e95ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with inflammatory diseases are treated with a variety of biologic agents. The association between use of biologics and tuberculosis is well known. Additionally, there are numerous case reports of infections in patients receiving biologics with organisms such as Pneumocystis, Listeria, Legionella, and Salmonella. Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System suggest that infection with these organisms in patients receiving infliximab is at least 5 times as frequent as would be expected if there was no association between use of the drug and the infection. Each of these organisms is typically susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), and this therefore represents a potentially attractive prophylaxis to prevent these infections in patients receiving biologics. A randomized controlled trial of TMP-SMZ prophylaxis in patients receiving biologics is necessary to prove that its utility outweighs risk, but may be best preceded by a multisite case-control study to determine which patients receiving biologics are at greatest risk.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

### Vasculitic neuropathies [^1f28410e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Vasculitis typically affects the 50- to 400-micron vessels of the vasa nervorum, leading to randomly distributed ischemia along the course of the nerve. This, in turn, leads to a distinctive picture, multiple mononeuropathy, as a frequent but not invariant clinical consequence of vasculitis. The diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy is usually made by biopsy histologic confirmation. The response to treatment varies among different vasculitides; vasculitis restricted to the peripheral nervous system is often especially responsive.

Because of its protean features, it can mimic many more common lung conditions in the immunocompromised patient, including atypical pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia and interstitial lung disease. In this article, we present the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented to our hospital with persistent dyspnoea and cough, initially suspected to have an arthritis-related interstitial lung disease. She received a final diagnosis of pulmonary toxoplasmosis after lung biopsy demonstrated Toxoplasma cysts, later confirmed by serology. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resulted in significant improvement of her respiratory symptoms after 3 months.

Though MAS is a common complication of SJIA, this case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential for MAS triggers, even in patients with known SJIA. Also, while recognising the importance of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients treated with multiple immunosuppressive medications, this case impresses that physicians and rheumatologists in particular, must be cognizant when using prophylactic TMP/SMX for their patients.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Peripheral neuropathies in rheumatic disease – a guide to diagnosis [^a4884b02]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including rheumatic disease. Although the association of the two disorders can be coincidental, an underlying pathogenic link can occur in many instances, which can affect treatment options. The presentation of peripheral neuropathy can be multifaceted, an important consideration when recognizing the condition and optimizing diagnosis. Furthermore, understanding the diagnostic strategy will help physicians treating patients with rheumatic disease who develop peripheral neuropathy. Finally, although available treatment options have greatly reduced the risk of patients with inflammatory disorders developing systemic complications, among which includes peripheral neuropathy, new therapeutic agents can trigger toxic or immune-mediated neuropathies and treatment will need to be adjusted accordingly. In this Review, we will discuss the general approach for diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy, and detail the presentation, pathophysiological features and general rules of treatment of patients with peripheral neuropathy in the context of rheumatic disease.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f6e15b4e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case-control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The primary outcome was a one-year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person-years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person-years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP-SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP-SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP-SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP-SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

### Vasculitic neuropathies [^5cfa69d5]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

The vasculitic neuropathies are a diverse group of disorders characterised by the acute-to-subacute onset of painful sensory and motor deficits that result from inflammatory destruction of nerve blood vessels and subsequent ischaemic injury. They are common in patients with primary systemic vasculitis and are seen in vasculitis secondary to disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, viral infections, and diabetic inflammatory neuropathies. It is imperative that neurologists recognise these disorders to initiate treatment promptly and thereby prevent morbidity and mortality. To simplify the approach to patients with vasculitis of the peripheral nerves, a straightforward, dichotomous classification scheme can be used in which the vasculitic neuropathies are divided into two groups-nerve large arteriole vasculitis and nerve microvasculitis-on the basis of the size of the involved vessels. The size of the affected blood vessels correlates with the clinical course and prognosis in patients with vasculitic neuropathy.

### Immunosuppressive treatment for non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy [^fdee7b35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy is a rare disabling disease that usually has a subacute onset of progressive or relapsing-remitting sensory or sensorimotor deficits. Asymmetry, pain and weakness are key features. The diagnosis can only be made by exclusion of other causes, the absence of systemic vasculitis or other rheumatic diseases, and the demonstration of vasculitis in a nerve or a combined nerve and muscle biopsy. There is a need for efficacious therapy to prevent disease progression and to improve prognosis.

Objectives

To assess if immunosuppressive treatment in non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy reduces disability, and ameliorates neurological symptoms, and if such therapy can be given safely.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (March 2006), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and ISI were searched from January 1980 until April 2006. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and textbooks were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials that examined the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment for non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy at least one year after the onset of therapy were sought. Participants had to fulfill the following criteria: absence of systemic or neurological disease, exclusion of any recognised cause of the neuropathy by appropriate clinical or laboratory investigations, electrophysiological studies in agreement with axonal neuropathy, confirmation of vasculitis in a nerve or a combined nerve and muscle biopsy. The primary outcome measure was to be improvement in disability. Secondary outcome measures were to be change in the mean disability score, change in muscle strength measured with the Medical Research Council sum score, change in pain or other positive sensory symptoms, number of relapses, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed and extracted details of all potentially relevant trials. For included studies pooled relative risks and pooled weighted standardised mean differences were to be calculated to assess treatment efficacy.

Main Results

Fifty-nine studies were identified and assessed for possible inclusion in the review, but all were excluded because of insufficient quality or lack of relevance.

Authors' Conclusions

No adequate randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials have been performed on which to base treatment for non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy. Randomised trials of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are needed.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^370e92a6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by the severe inflammation of small blood vessels and the development of autoantibodies to the proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. AAV poses significant clinical challenges because of potential major organ involvement, especially the respiratory tract and kidney. To achieve remission of life‐threatening AAV, glucocorticoids (GCs) combined with either rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) have been recommended. However, these intensive immunosuppressive therapies increase the risk of infection, which is the most frequent cause of death, especially in the early phase of the disease. Hence, preventing serious infection‐related complications is crucial to improve the treatment outcome of AAV.

Trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) is widely used as primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in patients who are immunocompromised, including those with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Notably, a few observational studies recently suggested that prophylactic TMP‐SMX could reduce the risk of serious infections, as well as PJP. Based on these findings, the EULAR recommended the prophylactic use of TMP‐SMX against PJP and other infections in patients with AAV. However, the effect of TMP‐SMX on the incidence of non‐PJP–related infection has not been confirmed in other studies. Furthermore, the risk of serious infections could be influenced by various patient‐specific factors, including disease activity, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive treatment. Moreover, the interaction between these factors and the efficacy of prophylactic TMP‐SMX against serious infections has not been thoroughly investigated. Using a target trial emulation framework, this observational study aimed to investigate the effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on serious infections and the clinical factors influencing its effectiveness in a large‐scale cohort of patients with AAV.

Pharmacologic treatment

Corticosteroids are considered the drug of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis with monitoring for potential adverse events, e.g. peptic ulcer diseases, systemic fungal infection, active tuberculosis, hypersensitivity, cataract formation, diabetes mellitus or osteoporosis [reviewed in 1, 20–23, 30, 36, 51, 53, 59]: The cranial neuropathy: according to the latest treatment algorithm for NS, proposed by Nozaki et al. (with input from personal communication from Professors Barney Stern and Robert P. Baughman) in 2013, in the case of cranial neuropathy, particularly where nerve VII is affected, prednisone is recommended in a daily dose of 20–40 mg with a decrease of dosage over 1–6 months to the lowest effective dose; if corticosteroids cannot be tapered to less than 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalent within 3–6 months, consideration should be given to higher dose prednisone and/or alternative agents; there was a tendency for recurrence of symptoms at doses of prednisone less than 20–25 mg/day [reviewed in 1, 36, 51]. The mild or moderate NS, usually initiate with 20–60 mg/day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent) with a decrease of dosage to the lowest effective dose; if corticosteroids cannot be tapered to less than 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalent within 3–6 months, consideration should be given to higher dose prednisone and/or alternative agents [reviewed in 20, 36]. The severe NS (e.g. altered sensorium, visual loss, or weakness), cases not responding to oral agents, and refractory NS: the administration of intravenous methylprednisolone is advised, at 1 g daily for 3–5 days followed by 1 g per week or daily prednisone orally with a decrease of dosage to the lowest effective dose [reviewed in 36].
Immunomodulating and cytotoxic agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine Methotrexate (MTX) — is used as a first-line corticosteroid-sparing agent and allows tapering of prednisone dose to 10 or 20 mg/day in more than one-third of NS cases [reviewed in 36, 51]; it is also reported a beneficial response to MTX in approximately one-fifth of NS patients, who failed prednisone monotherapy; a combination of corticosteroids and MTX has resulted in a favorable outcome in patients with severe CNS involvement [reviewed in 36]; the effectiveness of MTX, given orally, mostly in an initial dose of 7.5 mg/per week and then 10–20 mg/week is noted in about 60% of NS patients; it requires monitoring for adverse events, e.g. hepatotoxicity, renal insufficiency, pneumonitis, teratogenicity, bone marrow suppression; an administration of folinic acid may reduce toxicity [reviewed in 36]. Azathioprine — has been used for corticosteroid-refractory NS with potential adverse effects, like neutropenia, abnormal liver function tests, pancreatitis or allergic reactions [reviewed in 30, 55–57]; usual oral dose of azathioprine is 2–3 mg/kg [reviewed in 57]. Cyclosporine — it was beneficial in some patients, who failed prednisone monotherapy; others worsened in spite of a combination of cyclosporine and corticosteroid therapy; it can be started at 4 mg/kg/day in divided doses and requires monitoring for adverse events, e.g. hypertension, renal failure, hypomagnesemia, and neurotoxicity [reviewed in 30]. Cyclophosphamide — due to its high toxicity and significant side effects (bone marrow suppression, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity), the use of it is usually limited to severe NS, when TNF-α antagonist cannot be obtained, in NS refractory to other agents; it is also corticosteroid-sparing agent in NS and allows tapering of prednisone dose to 10 mg; according to authors, dose of cyclophosphamide is 500–1000 mg intravenously over 30–60 min every 2–4 weeks or 0.5 g/m 2 of body surface area intravenously every 4 weeks depending on age, leukocyte count or renal function; given orally, an initial dose 25–50 mg/day is increased by 25 mg increments to ensure adequate immunosuppression; the maximum oral dose is 150 mg/day; intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide is preferred over oral administration due to a lesser side effects. Mycophenalate mofetil — immunosuppressant as an analog of methotrexate is considered for patients with central NS, though not effective in NS of the muscles [reviewed in 36]. Anti-malarial agents, like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have anti-inflammatory effects and they are also effective in sarcoidosis, especially in patients with NS and sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia and/or sarcoid skin lesions; its standard oral dosage is 250–750 mg daily; hydroxychloroquine has lower risk of ocular toxicity than chloroquine, but is less effective than chloroquine; because hydroxychloroquine reduces serum glucose levels, it may be useful for NS patients with steroid-induced hyperglycemia; its standard dosage is 200–400 mg daily orally. A tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor — e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, thalidomide, pentoxifylline: infliximab is commonly used for neurosarcoidosis that is refractory to other agents and/or corticosteroid-induced complications; in a recent case series of 29 patients with spinal cord neurosarcoidosis, infliximab was the second most frequently used immunosuppressive agent after corticosteroids; it is also useful for therapy of SFN; infliximab 3–5 mg/kg intravenously every 4–8 weeks; often, patients receive an initial loading dose of 3–5 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6 [reviewed in 36]; adalimumab and teratogenic thalidomide are effective especially for spinal forms of NS; pentoxifylline have been shown to be effective for various types of organ involvement from systemic sarcoidosis, however, their role in the treatment of neurosarcoidosis is unknown [reviewed in 36, 57]; several major toxicities are encountered with the anti-TNF therapies, but one of the more serious concerns is the increased risk of tuberculosis and similar infections.

### Meningeal rheumatoid nodules in a 55-year-old man presenting with chronic headaches and oculomotor nerve palsy: an uncommon extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis [^06aa5176]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem inflammatory disease which can involve many organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Though not very common, the results can be severely debilitating. The spectrum of the CNS involvement includes meningitis, encephalitis and occasionally rheumatoid nodules. Its presentation is variable, though very rarely it can present as focal neurological deficits. Imaging can be suggestive, but diagnosis usually requires tissue biopsy. Treatment consists of high-dose steroids and immunosuppressants. We describe the case of a 55-year-old male patient with a history of RA presenting with a third nerve palsy and headache who was found to have rheumatoid nodules on biopsy. CNS involvement in RA should be considered in anyone with rheumatoid arthritis who presents with focal neurological deficits, though infections and space-occupying lesions should also be ruled out.

### Systemic low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in rheumatoid arthritis [^5f41c696]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids provide a large, immediate improvement in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. At doses acceptable for long-term treatment, however, symptoms gradually re-emerge. Relatively low doses of glucocorticoids can, for several years, substantially retard the rate of joint destruction shown on radiographs. This differential effect implies the coexistence of two pathologic processes within diseased joints. Long term, low dose glucocorticoid therapy probably increases the risk of serious adverse effects, but an evidence-based case can be made for the limited use of low dose glucocorticoid treatment in early disease.

On examination, temperature was 100.9F, heart rate 111/min and she had orthostatic hypotension. Laboratory tests showed elevated blood urea nitrogen and white cell count. The patient underwent treatment for symptomatic urinary tract infection and while her fever and leucocytosis resolved, tachycardia persisted. An EKG done showed T inversions in leads II, III, arteriovenous fistula, V2 and V3. Troponin-I was elevated. Nuclear stress test revealed apical wall motion abnormality confirming myocardial infarction. Ewing's tests were carried out at bedside and these diagnosed severe autonomic neuropathy. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause cardiac autonomic neuropathy from chronic inflammation. This case entails the importance of assessing and detecting cardiac autonomic neuropathy in chronic inflammatory conditions, and the need to be cautious of acute coronary events in these patients, even for minimal or no symptoms.

### Histiocytoid sweet syndrome recalcitrant to prednisone causing severe scarring [^d70e17a7]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman presented with fever, conjunctivitis, and a 1-week history of generalized erythematous, edematous papules and plaques (Fig 1). Her medical history was positive for rectal cancer, which was treated with mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil and field radiation. Her treatment ended 6 months before presentation without any evidence of recurrence. The patient denied any symptoms of upper respiratory infections or arthritis, a history of connective tissue disease, and recent travel. The patient also denied a history of keloids or hypertrophic scarring. The patient did not admit to picking, manipulating, or traumatizing any of the sites to induce scar formation. Her medications included sertraline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The urinary tract infection resolved, and the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was discontinued 3 days after presentation. Laboratory tests found leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/mm 3 (normal, 4.4–10.5) with 71% neutrophils (normal, 36%-70%) and 17% bands (normal, 0%-6%). A biopsy specimen was obtained from her back, which revealed leukocytoclastic neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrates without vasculitis in the dermis. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD43, CD68, and myeloperoxidase. Because of her lack of response to prednisone, a second biopsy from the axilla was performed to confirm the diagnosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (Fig 2, A and B). The patient was started on 40 mg prednisone daily. She took prednisone for approximately 2 years with dosages ranging from 10 to 60 mg/d. She was recalcitrant to prednisone therapy despite being on prednisone for 2 years in conjunction with trials of multiple other medications including topical steroids, dapsone, indomethacin, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate. The patient's disease was eventually controlled on colchicine, but severe hypertrophic scars developed on the buttocks and lower extremities (Fig 3). Clinically, the scars appeared to be keloidal. However, a biopsy of a scar from the left buttock showed hypertrophic scarring.

The inflammatory neuropathies are a large diverse group of immune-mediated neuropathies that are amenable to treatment and may be reversible. Their accurate diagnosis is essential for informing the patient of the likely course and prognosis of the disease, informing the treating physician of the appropriate therapy and informing the scientific community of the results of well-targeted, designed and performed clinical trials. With the advent of biological therapies able to manipulate the immune response more specifically, an understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions is increasingly important.

### Methotrexate drug interactions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review [^57ba47ed]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have comorbidities that require multiple medications. Several of these medications may alter the efficacy or increase the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX). The purpose of our study was to determine which drugs used in combination with MTX (excluding disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, folic and folinic acid, corticosteroids, and biologic agents) enhance side effects or toxicity of MTX or lower its efficacy.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed with Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and Database, and abstracts from the 2006/2007 annual congresses of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. A manual search of the citation lists of retrieved publications was performed.

Results

Of the 1172 articles identified, 67 were included: 21 pharmacokinetics studies, 5 observational studies, and 78 case reports. Most medications do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics profile of MTX. Among the clinical studies, cytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes were the main reported toxicities. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was mentioned as a risk factor for developing cytopenia in one observational study and in 17 case reports. Thirty case reports of cytopenia were attributed to the use of concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid. Two studies described mild abnormalities of liver enzymes with the use of isoniazid, and one study with the use of high-dose ASA.

Conclusion

Based on the published literature, MTX has limited drug interactions, with the exception of TMP-SMX and high-dose ASA, which can exacerbate toxicity of MTX. The clinical significance of these interactions has not been substantiated by extensive clinical observations.

Analysis

We described cohort characteristics at the index date, overall and according to baseline TMP-SMX use, using means (with.) for continuous data and counts and percentages for categorical data. Differences between baseline TMP-SMX users and non-users were assessed using the 95% CI for the difference in mean or proportion.

Crude incidence rates for serious infections, outpatient infection visits and PJP infections were calculated overall and according to person-time with and without TMP-SMX exposure, by dividing the number of events occurring during exposed and unexposed periods by the sum of person-time exposed and unexposed to TMP-SMX during follow-up, respectively.

Kaplan–Meier curves plotted serious infection-free survival among individuals exposed and unexposed to baseline TMP-SMX. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of time-varying TMP-SMX use with serious infection, considering the following potential confounders and effect modifiers for inclusion in multivariable models: age, sex, insurance (Commercial vs Medicare/Medicaid), disease duration (dichotomized as < or > 6 months), baseline prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, hospital admission or serious infection (defined previously) in the 6 months before rituximab, induction rituximab (vs maintenance), use of other immunosuppressants in the 6 months before rituximab, and having one of the following conditions: interstitial lung disease, obstructive lung disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or dialysis. The final multivariable model included age, sex, prednisone use, as well as any variables significantly associated with serious infection in univariable analyses (i.e. a hazard ratio [HR] with 95% CI excluding the null). We performed the same procedure for the secondary outcomes of outpatient infection and PJP.

To assess the association of TMP-SMX with adverse events potentially attributable to TMP-SMX, we included individuals with no prescriptions for TMP-SMX prior to the index date. Crude incidence rates were computed during person-time exposed and unexposed to TMP-SMX. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of time-varying TMP-SMX with adverse events, considering the following potential confounders or effect modifiers: age, sex, insurance status (Commercial vs Medicare/Medicaid), induction rituximab (vs maintenance), disease duration > 6 months (vs ≤ 6 months), hospitalization in the 6 months prior to rituximab, baseline prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, and having ≥ 1 co-morbidity. The multivariable model included age, sex, prednisone use and covariates significantly associated with adverse events in univariable analyses.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

### The role of trimethoprim / sulfametoxazole in reducing relapses and risk of infections in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a meta-analysis [^425837ac]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies including a control group regarding the role of trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole (TMP/SMX) in reducing the relapse rate in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and the risk of infections in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception until 15 January 2020 to identify controlled studies assessing the role of TMP/SMX in reducing the rate of relapse in patients with GPA (primary outcome) and the number and/or severity of infections in patients with AAV (secondary outcome). Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies and extracted data. Cumulative risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI were calculated using a random effect meta-analysis.

Results

Eight studies were selected out of 2907 records. Seven studies (520 patients) (of which two were RCTs) assessed the role of TMP/SMX in the relapse rate in patients with GPA. TMP/SMX was not associated with a reduced risk of relapse (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.51, 2.55; I2 = 78.5%; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis according to the dose of TMP/SMX (960mg twice daily vs three times/week) confirmed the results. One retrospective cohort study (192 patients) was identified demonstrating a significant reduction of severe infections in patients with AAV receiving prophylaxis with TMP/SMX in association with rituximab.

Conclusion

TMP/SMX was not associated with a reduced risk of relapse in patients with GPA. TMP/SMX might be useful in the reduction of infectious complications.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^4c4464b8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrated that the prophylactic use of TMP‐SMX significantly lowered the risk of serious infection in patients with AAV with the greatest impact observed during the initial 180 days of the observation period. The benefits were more evident in patients with additional risk factors for serious infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale cohort study to focus on factors affecting the prophylactic effect of TMP‐SMX.

Patients with AAV are more susceptible to serious infections than the general population because of disease‐specific organ damage, potential long‐term effects of widespread inflammation, and medications used to treat AAV. The increased susceptibility to infection is most significant in the early phase because of intensive immunosuppressive treatment; thus, infection is one of the common causes of early mortality in patients with AAV. This study confirmed these reports, as indicated by the 1‐year incidence of serious infection after induction therapy using RTX or CYC of 30.5 per 100 person‐years, with a significant fatality rate, which suggests that decreasing the risk of serious infections is crucial for improving treatment outcomes in patients with AAV.

Despite its significant impact on the prognosis of patients with AAV, there have been few studies on optimal management to minimize the risk of infection. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that prophylactic TMP‐SMX could prevent serious infections in patients with AAV as well as PJP, which is consistent with the results of this study, in which the prophylaxis group was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in serious infections compared with the control group. The mechanisms underlying the reduced incidence of serious infections in patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX remain unclear. However, TMP‐SMX has broad‐spectrum antimicrobial effects against bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which may allow the removal of pathogens in patients with AAV. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that prophylactic TMP‐SMX was associated with a lower incidence of bacterial infections in patients with HIV infection. Although the antimicrobial effect of TMP‐SMX has not been thoroughly investigated in patients without HIV, our results strongly suggest that prophylactic TMP‐SMX provides additional benefits in patients with AAV beyond reducing the risk of PJP. Furthermore, we demonstrated a favorable safety profile of prophylactic TMP‐SMX, with the NNH for serious ADR being significantly higher than the NNT to prevent one case of serious infection. This risk‐benefit assessment indicates that prophylactic TMP‐SMX should be administered to patients with AAV receiving induction immunosuppressive treatment.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole significantly reduces the risk of nocardiosis in solid organ transplant recipients: systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^b89c1f6b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis prevents nocardiosis in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effect of TMP-SMX in the prevention of nocardiosis after SOT, its dose-response relationship, its effect on preventing disseminated nocardiosis, and the risk of TMP-SMX resistance in case of breakthrough infection.

Methods

A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus up to 19 September 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

(a) Risk of nocardiosis between SOT recipients with and without TMP-SMX prophylaxis, or (b) sufficient details to determine the rate of TMP-SMX resistance in breakthrough nocardiosis.

Participants

SOT recipients.

Intervention

TMP-SMX prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure (ROBINS-E) for comparative studies; dedicated tool for non-comparative studies.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

For our primary outcome (i.e. to determine the effect of TMP-SMX on the risk of nocardiosis), a one-step mixed-effects regression model was used to estimate the association between the outcome and the exposure. Univariate and multivariable unconditional regression models were used to adjust for the potential confounding effects. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Individual data from three case-control studies were obtained (260 SOT recipients with nocardiosis and 519 uninfected controls). TMP-SMX prophylaxis was independently associated with a significantly decreased risk of nocardiosis (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.18–0.52, moderate certainty of evidence). Variables independently associated with an increased risk of nocardiosis were older age, current use of corticosteroids, high calcineurin inhibitor concentration, recent acute rejection, lower lymphocyte count, and heart transplant. Breakthrough infections (66/260, 25%) were generally susceptible to TMP-SMX (pooled proportion 98%, 95% CI 92–100).

Conclusions

In SOT recipients, TMP-SMX prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of nocardiosis. Resistance appears uncommon in case of breakthrough infection.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Gonococcal acute bacterial arthritis — N. gonorrhoeae is not an uncommon pathogen among adolescents with ABA; parenteral therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin, typically ceftriaxone, should be started, and oral therapy generally should be considered only after antibiotic susceptibility data are available. Due to increasing resistance, cefixime is no longer routinely recommended, though oral options may include high dose oral cefixime or a fluoroquinolone if susceptibility has been documented; although routine fluoroquinolone use is not usually recommended in children < 18 years old because of toxicity concerns, use in this circumstance is appropriate, and when gonococcal infection is documented, evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections including HIV and syphilis is warranted.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.
