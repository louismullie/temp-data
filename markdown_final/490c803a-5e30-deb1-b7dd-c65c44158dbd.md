## Question

ADH and sodium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) interacts with sodium balance and what that means clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of ADH and its renal effects. Then, I should verify how ADH excess produces hyponatremia and the diagnostic framework for SIADH. Next, I will examine the clinical consequences and the distinction from cerebral salt wasting. After that, I need to review management principles, including acute versus chronic care, fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, vaptans, and urea, with attention to overcorrection risk. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize practical takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the physiology. ADH is synthesized in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary, acting on renal V2 receptors to insert aquaporin-2 into collecting ducts, which increases water reabsorption and concentrates urine, thereby defending plasma osmolality and serum sodium within a narrow range, typically within 1–2% of normal when water access is unrestricted. Hold on, I should verify the sodium angle: while ADH primarily governs water, it also enhances epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the distal nephron to sustain the medullary osmotic gradient, which indirectly supports water reabsorption, so ADH can modestly reduce sodium excretion in some contexts, though its dominant effect is on water handling rather than net sodium balance [^111QaHEv] [^111yho3U].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology of ADH excess. In SIADH, inappropriate or nonosmotic ADH secretion persists despite low plasma osmolality, causing water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and concentrated urine; importantly, volume expansion triggers secondary natriuresis, so patients are clinically euvolemic but sodium-depleted, which further lowers serum sodium and can perpetuate the hyponatremia even if ADH levels fluctuate [^117SmQrk] [^111yho3U]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria: effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, euvolemia, urine sodium typically greater than 30 mmol/L in the absence of adrenal, thyroid, or renal disease, and no recent diuretic use are the essential features, with supplemental markers like low uric acid and low urea supporting the diagnosis [^115cSj3z] [^113VBoKn].

> Next, I should review the clinical consequences. Acute hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema and encephalopathy, with symptoms ranging from nausea and headache to seizures and coma, and the risk rises as sodium falls below about 125 mEq/L or if the decline is rapid [^111fLWER]. Chronic hyponatremia is often labeled "asymptomatic", but wait, I should double-check that: it is associated with gait instability, cognitive impairment, falls, osteoporosis, and increased mortality, even when biochemical severity is modest, underscoring that chronic hyponatremia is not benign [^116WdLtD] [^115XadcF]. I need to ensure I note the mortality signal: large meta-analyses associate hyponatremia with a roughly 2.6-fold increased mortality, and improvement in sodium correlates with lower death risk, though causality remains debated and confounding is common [^115XadcF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neurosurgical hyponatremia being SIADH by default. I should distinguish SIADH from cerebral salt wasting, which presents with hypovolemia and high urine sodium due to renal sodium wasting; critically, CSW requires volume repletion, whereas SIADH requires fluid restriction, so misclassification worsens outcomes. In TBI and SAH, a triphasic pattern of CDI followed by SIADH is well described, and differentiating these entities guides safe management [^112ndk8z] [^116w76gQ]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: in neurotrauma, empiric fluid restriction without confirming volume status can be harmful if CSW is present, reinforcing the need for careful clinical and biochemical assessment before committing to restriction [^112ndk8z].

> I will now examine acute management. For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, hypertonic saline is indicated to raise sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L rapidly to mitigate cerebral edema, with a hard limit of 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination; proactive desmopressin can be considered in select cases to prevent spontaneous overcorrection, though evidence is limited and this remains controversial [^112sZjn1] [^115eEJTN]. Wait, I should verify monitoring cadence: frequent sodium checks, often every 4–6 hours initially, are essential to detect and manage overcorrection promptly, and if the sodium rise exceeds targets, hypotonic fluids with or without desmopressin are used to safely relower sodium [^112sZjn1] [^113Ucrn6].

> For chronic SIADH, I need to check first-line therapy. Fluid restriction to about 800–1,000 mL/day is guideline-endorsed, but real-world response is modest and inconsistent, with roughly half of patients failing to achieve a clinically meaningful sodium rise, so expectations should be tempered and alternatives considered when urine osmolality exceeds about 500 mOsm/kg or the sodium-to-urea ratio is unfavorable [^114MVSuY] [^113rohyY]. Let me verify second-line options: oral urea at 15–30 g/day is supported by observational data and a recent meta-analysis showing average sodium increases around 9–10 mmol/L with low overcorrection risk, though palatability is a limitation and randomized trials are sparse [^113tpb9e] [^114aNjKF]. Vasopressin receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan are effective but carry a meaningful risk of overly rapid correction, especially in patients with low BMI, low BUN, high GFR, or cancer; if used, close monitoring is mandatory and many centers cap the initial rise at 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^112csi2t] [^113kbLYG]. I should confirm that loop diuretics plus salt tablets are no longer favored due to lack of benefit and higher rates of hypokalemia and AKI in a randomized trial, so I should avoid recommending that combination routinely [^117CHGVN].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has neurotrauma or is on certain drugs. In pediatrics, isotonic maintenance fluids reduce iatrogenic hyponatremia, and SIADH remains a common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia; management principles mirror adults, with fluid restriction first-line and careful avoidance of overcorrection [^112Vb4tm] [^113fEaVG]. In neurotrauma, anticipate dynamic transitions from CDI to SIADH and tailor fluids accordingly to avoid cerebral edema or demyelination, and remember that medications like SSRIs, carbamazepine, and linezolid can precipitate SIADH, so medication reconciliation is essential [^116w76gQ] [^113km9Rs]. I should double-check that in cirrhosis and heart failure, nonosmotic ADH drive contributes to hyponatremia; vaptans can be useful when fluid restriction fails, but they do not improve survival from the underlying disease, so expectations must be framed clearly [^114ThkwS] [^113ZUHV3].

> Let me synthesize the practical takeaways. ADH primarily governs water reabsorption and secondarily supports sodium retention mechanisms that facilitate water conservation; in SIADH, inappropriate ADH activity causes water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and natriuresis, producing euvolemic but sodium-depleted patients; acute symptomatic hyponatremia warrants hypertonic saline with strict correction limits, whereas chronic SIADH relies on fluid restriction with urea or vaptans as needed, always guarding against overcorrection and reassessing for reversible causes [^117SmQrk] [^112sZjn1] [^113tpb9e]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: distinguishing SIADH from CSW and from hypovolemic hyponatremia is foundational because it reverses the fluid strategy; when uncertain, a cautious trial of isotonic saline with close monitoring of urine output and sodium response can clarify the diagnosis and prevent harm [^112ndk8z] [^114NwZaW].

---

ADH (vasopressin) regulates water balance by increasing renal water reabsorption, but it does not directly alter sodium handling; however, **ADH-driven water retention dilutes serum sodium**, causing hyponatremia when intake is unrestricted. In SIADH, inappropriate ADH secretion produces **dilutional hyponatremia** with concentrated urine and normal or high urine sodium, despite low serum osmolality. Management centers on fluid restriction, hypertonic saline for severe cases, and vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) or urea for refractory cases, with careful monitoring to avoid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER] [^114ThkwS] [^113tpb9e].

## Physiological role of ADH in sodium balance

ADH is released from the hypothalamus in response to increased plasma osmolality or decreased effective arterial blood volume, acting on renal V2 receptors to insert aquaporin-2 and increase water reabsorption, thereby concentrating urine and reducing free water excretion [^111QaHEv] [^111yho3U]. ADH does not directly regulate sodium transport; however, **water retention lowers serum sodium concentration** by dilution, even though total body sodium may be normal or slightly increased [^117SmQrk].

---

## ADH and sodium disorders

### Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, and **SIADH is the leading cause of euvolemic hyponatremia** [^116omhxd]. SIADH is defined by inappropriate ADH secretion despite low plasma osmolality, resulting in water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and concentrated urine [^117SmQrk]. Common causes include malignancy (especially small-cell lung cancer), CNS disorders, pulmonary diseases, and drugs such as SSRIs, carbamazepine, and cyclophosphamide [^117SmQrk].

---

### Hypernatremia

Hypernatremia results from impaired ADH secretion or renal responsiveness, causing excessive free water loss and concentrated plasma; diabetes insipidus is the classic example, with either central (ADH deficiency) or nephrogenic (renal resistance) forms [^11319S3y].

---

## Clinical implications of ADH dysregulation

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)

- **Pathophysiology**: Persistent ADH activity despite low plasma osmolality drives water retention, diluting serum sodium; secondary natriuresis further lowers sodium and maintains euvolemia [^117SmQrk].
- **Clinical features**: Nausea, headache, confusion, seizures, and coma correlate with severity and rapidity of hyponatremia [^117SmQrk].
- **Diagnosis**: Hypotonic hyponatremia with urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg, urine sodium typically > 30 mmol/L, and euvolemia, excluding adrenal, thyroid, and renal disease [^115cSj3z].

---

### Diabetes insipidus (DI)

In diabetes insipidus, **ADH deficiency or resistance** causes polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia if water intake is restricted or unavailable [^11319S3y].

---

## Management strategies

### SIADH management

- **Fluid restriction**: First-line therapy; limit to 800–1,000 mL/day [^notfound].
- **Hypertonic saline**: For severe symptomatic hyponatremia (e.g. 3% NaCl boluses) to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L acutely [^notfound].
- **Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)**: Tolvaptan or conivaptan for refractory cases; monitor for overcorrection and liver injury [^114ThkwS].
- **Urea**: Oral urea (15–30 g/day) increases free water excretion and is effective when fluid restriction is not feasible [^113tpb9e].

---

### DI management

Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic ADH analog, is the cornerstone of therapy; **careful fluid balance** is essential to avoid hyponatremia from overtreatment [^117EpDBt].

---

## Risks and complications

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)**: Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (> 8–10 mmol/L in 24 h) can cause irreversible neurologic injury [^112sZjn1].
- **Overcorrection risk**: Higher with lower baseline sodium, low BMI, high GFR, and concurrent therapies; monitor closely and be prepared to relower sodium with desmopressin and hypotonic fluids if needed [^113kbLYG] [^113Ucrn6].

---

ADH primarily regulates water, not sodium, but its water-retaining effect can **dilute serum sodium** and cause hyponatremia in SIADH. Management focuses on fluid restriction, hypertonic saline for severe cases, and vaptans or urea for refractory cases, with vigilant monitoring to prevent overcorrection and ODS [^111fLWER] [^114ThkwS] [^113tpb9e].

### The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^117SmQrk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions:

- **Definition**: The SIADH is a disorder of impaired water excretion caused by persistent or uncontrolled release of ADH (arginine vasopressin) despite normal or low plasma osmolality. This leads to water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and inappropriately concentrated urine. The condition is normovolemic and characterized by low serum sodium, low plasma osmolality, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg, and urine sodium typically > 40 mEq/L in the absence of renal, adrenal, or thyroid disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: The syndrome arises when the normal osmotic suppression of ADH release fails. Persistent hormone activity increases water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, expanding total body water and diluting serum sodium. Secondary natriuresis restores extracellular volume but further lowers serum sodium. Multiple secretion patterns exist, including continuous inappropriate release, a "reset osmostat" with a lower osmotic threshold, and receptor-level activation independent of hormone concentration. Chronic stimulation also upregulates aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) water channels, maintaining water retention.
- **Epidemiology**: The SIADH is the most common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. It occurs at any age but is particularly frequent in older adults and hospitalized patients. The prevalence among patients with significant hyponatremia varies widely, ranging from 30–50% in tertiary care settings. Inappropriate secretion of ADH is especially common in patients with pulmonary disease, intracranial pathology, or small cell carcinoma of the lung.
- **Disease course**: The onset may be acute or chronic depending on the rate of serum sodium decline. Neurologic symptoms such as headache, confusion, gait disturbance, seizures, and coma reflect cerebral edema caused by hypotonicity. Severe or rapid hyponatremia can be fatal, whereas chronic mild forms are often asymptomatic. Etiologic factors include CNS disorders, pulmonary infections, malignancies, medications such as carbamazepine, SSRIs, and cyclophosphamide, postoperative states, and endocrine deficiencies. Rarely, hereditary forms result from activating mutations in the vasopressin-2 receptor (V2R).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Outcome depends on the underlying cause and the rapidity of sodium correction. When the precipitating factor is reversible, sodium levels normalize with treatment and recurrence is uncommon. Chronic or idiopathic cases may persist but can often be controlled with long-term fluid management. Mortality is primarily related to severe hyponatremia, rapid shifts in serum sodium, or the associated malignancy rather than the syndrome itself.

Context

Although the physiology of sodium, water, and arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone, has long been known, accumulating data suggest that this system operates as a more complex network than previously thought.

Evidence Acquisition

English-language basic science and clinical studies of AVP and osmolarity on the development of kidney and cardiovascular disease and overall outcomes.

Evidence Synthesis

Apart from osmoreceptors and hypovolemia, AVP secretion is modified by novel factors such as tongue acid-sensing taste receptor cells and brain median preoptic nucleus neurons. Moreover, pharyngeal, esophageal, and/or gastric sensors and gut microbiota modulate AVP secretion. Evidence is accumulating that increased osmolarity, AVP, copeptin, and dehydration are all associated with worse outcomes in chronic disease states such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and heart failure. On the basis of these pathophysiological relationships, an AVP receptor 2 blocker is now licensed for CKD related to polycystic kidney disease.

Conclusion

From a therapeutic perspective, fluid intake may be associated with increased AVP secretion if it is driven by loss of urine concentration capacity or with suppressed AVP if it is driven by voluntary fluid intake. In the current review, we summarize the literature on the relationship between elevated osmolarity, AVP, copeptin, and dehydration with renal and cardiovascular outcomes and underlying classical and novel pathophysiologic pathways. We also review recent unexpected and contrasting findings regarding AVP physiology in an attempt to explain and understand some of these relationships.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Whole-body volume regulation and escape from antidiuresis [^117Jo1cW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Both individual cells and organs regulate their volume in response to sustained hypo-osmolality via solute and water losses. Similar processes occur in the whole body to regulate the volumes of extracellular fluid (ECF) and intravascular spaces toward normal levels. Body water losses occur via the phenomena "escape from antidiuresis"; solute losses occur through the secondary natriuresis induced by water retention. As a result of resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling, escape from antidiuresis is caused by downregulation of kidney aquaporin-2 expression despite high AVP plasma levels. Recent data have implicated downregulation of vasopressin V2R as a potential mechanism of resistance, and suggest that this may be a result of decreased intrarenal angiotensin II signaling in combination with increased intrarenal nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 signaling. The natriuresis that results in volume regulation of the ECF and vascular spaces is the result of intrarenal hemodynamic changes produced by volume expansion, but the degree to which these effects are modulated by aldosterone secretion and the activity of distal sodium cotransporters and channels remains to be elucidated. The clinical implication of these volume-regulatory processes is that the chronic hyponatremic state is one of water retention and solute losses from intracellular fluid and ECF compartments. The degree to which solute losses versus water retention contribute to hyponatremia will vary in association with many factors, including the etiology of the hyponatremia, the rapidity of development of the hyponatremia, the chronicity of the hyponatremia, the volume of daily water loading, and individual variability. Understanding these volume-regulatory processes allows a better understanding of many aspects of the conundrum of patients with "clinical euvolemia" and dilutional hyponatremia from AVP-induced water retention.

### The release of antidiuretic hormone is appropriate in response to hypovolemia and / or sodium administration in children with severe head injury: a trial of lactated Ringer's solution versus hypertonic saline [^114n5T2R]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We conducted an open, randomized, and prospective study to determine the effect of hypertonic saline on the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone in children with severe head injury (Glasgow coma scale < 8). Thirty-one consecutive patients at a level III pediatric intensive care unit at a children's hospital received either lactated Ringer's solution (Ringer's group, n = 16) or hypertonic saline (Hypertonic Saline group, n = 15) over a 3-day period. Serum ADH levels were significantly larger in the Hypertonic Saline group as compared with the Ringer's group (P = 0.001; analysis of variance) and were correlated to sodium intake (Ringer's group: r = 0.39, R² = 0.15, P = 0.02; Hypertonic Saline group: r = 0.42, R² = 0.18, P = 0.02) and volume of fluids given IV (Ringer's group: r = 0.38, R² = 0.15, P = 0.02; Hypertonic Saline group: r = 0.32, R(2) = 0.1, P = not significant). Correlation of ADH to plasma osmolality was significant if plasma osmolality was > 280 mOsm/kg (r = 0.5, R² = 0.25, P = 0.06), indicating an osmotic threshold for ADH release. Serum aldosterone levels were larger on the first day than during Days 2 and 3 in both groups and inversely correlated to serum sodium levels only in the Ringer's group (r = -0.55, R(2) = 0.3, P < 0.001). This group received a significantly larger fluid volume on Day 1 (P = 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) than did patients in the Hypertonic Saline group, indicating hypovolemia during the first day. Head-injured children have appropriate levels of ADH. They may be hypovolemic during the first day of treatment, especially if they receive lactated Ringer's solution.

Implications

In head-injured patients, we recommend fluid restriction to avoid inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. In a prospective, randomized, and controlled study in 31 children, we were able to show that the antidiuretic hormone levels are appropriate in response to hypovolemia, sodium load, or both.

### Recovery from SIADH-associated osteoporosis: a case report [^114qZXuR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies show an association between hyponatremia and osteoporosis. We have previously reported a case of severe male osteoporosis due to chronic syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Here, we provide a follow-up on this case after cure of the condition that further supports the causal relationship.

The Case

A 38-year-old man had been diagnosed with severe osteoporosis most likely due to chronic SIADH. The SIADH was believed to be idiopathic. A magnetic resonance imaging scan, however, revealed a tumor in the sinus, and biopsies showed an esthesioneuroblastoma, immunohistochemically positive for antidiuretic hormone (ADH). After the tumor was removed, ADH and sodium levels normalized. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan performed 7 months after the patient's last surgery showed a significant spontaneous improvement in bone mineral density in the lumbar vertebrae.

Conclusion

This case provides evidence for a causal relationship between SIADH and chronic hyponatremia and impaired bone metabolism that can lead to severe secondary osteoporosis. The effect on bone metabolism is at least partially reversible.

Physiological regulation of water homeostasis

Serum sodium levels are physiologically maintained within a narrow range, despite wide variations in water and salt intake. Serum osmolality is tightly regulated by the interaction between the secretion and action of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP), which is synthesised in neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland, and the sensation of thirst to promote water intake from the thirst centre in the hypothalamus. In a healthy adult, the average oral intake of approximately 1–3 L/day of water is required to maintain normal fluid balance and eunatraemia. Serum osmolality (ratio of solutes to water in the blood plasma) is the principal stimulus for AVP secretion. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus are the major contributors of water regulation, as they are exquisitely sensitive to changes in serum osmolality. Baroreceptors located in the carotid arteries and aortic arch can also affect AVP secretion in response to decreases in blood volume or arterial pressure. After secretion, AVP binds to the V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, stimulating an intracellular cascade that leads to migration of vesicle-bound aquaporin-2 to the luminal membrane of the collecting duct. This process renders the cells of the collecting duct permeable to water, allowing for passive water reabsorption from the kidney into the blood, such that decreased urine volume can occur, resulting in increased urine concentration. Simultaneously, the thirst centre in the lamina terminalis of the third ventricle is stimulated to promote water consumption. Thus, AVP-mediated restriction of water excretion combined with thirst-driven water intake leads to an increase in plasma water and normalisation of serum osmolality. Regulation of this homeostatic process is very intricate and efficient, resulting in serum osmolality that rarely strays by more than 2% when access to water is unrestricted. The mechanisms regulating sodium and water homeostasis are summarised in figure 1.

### Sodium and water disorders [^113pxZLV]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The balancing of fluids and electrolytes is a core function of the kidneys. There are redundant mechanisms within the body to sense the adequacy of organ perfusion and the composition of body fluids aimed at maintaining hemodynamics and protecting an environment for optimal cellular function. Sodium and water are key components of extracellular fluid and are regulated in response to end-organ perfusion and serum tonicity. Baroreceptors activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide to adjust sodium handling to alter extracellular volume. Osmoreceptors affect anti-diuretic hormone release and aquaporin activity in the medullary collecting duct to modify the handling of water. Disordered handling of sodium and/or water may be adaptive or maladaptive, and understanding the stimuli and responses to clinical scenarios assists clinicians in developing appropriate treatment strategies.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111sjqQX]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by "inappropriate" (ie, nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD later published by the same authors in 1967 have remained remarkably current (Table 1).

Table 1.
Criteria for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate diuresis

Over the decades since, understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia that have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the current understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing current guidelines, and to appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is more precisely referred to as low effective osmolality or tonicity. "Effective" osmolytes (eg, sodium, glucose, potassium, organic osmolytes) do not cross the cell membrane freely, so they have the capacity to create osmotic forces to influence the movement of water across cell membranes. In contrast, "ineffective" osmolytes (eg, ethanol, urea) freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not cause water shifts.

In hypotonic hyponatremia the low serum sodium concentration is primarily due to a relative excess of circulating free water, with or without a sodium deficit. Nonhypotonic hyponatremia can either be measured due to a method-dependent laboratory artifact, in which case it is termed pseudohyponatremia, or can be caused by excess of an effective osmolyte in the circulation (eg, hyperglycemia), in which case it is termed translocational hyponatremia (Fig. 1).

### Impact of serum sodium concentrations, and effect modifiers on mortality in the Irish health system [^112P6275]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The most striking interaction noted in our analysis was the effect modification by kidney function. The impact of dysnatraemia on mortality was of greater magnitude in those without CKD than with CKD, although the absolute mortality for CKD patients was greater than that for non CKD (S 2 Fig.). A graded risk pattern was observed with increasing GFR that was not explained with adjustment for several indicators of health status. The spline analyses confirmed a more flattened curve for patients with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.72m 2 and a shift in risk thresholds compared to those with higher GFR values. Serum sodium is regulated through water intake, via thirst sensation, and water excretion, via the actions of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) on the collecting ducts of the nephron. Disruption of these homeostatic mechanisms may lead to abnormal dilution or concentration of the extracellular fluid resulting in hypo- or hypernatraemia. Kovesdy et al. advanced the hypothesis that the chronic nature of the abnormalities affecting water metabolism in CKD may allow the body to adapt to these consequences and thus mitigate the impact on adverse outcomes. This adaptive mechanism may explain why the U-shaped association between serum sodium and mortality is flattened in patients with lower levels of kidney function, and why there is a very clear shift in sodium thresholds for mortality (optimal range: 137–142 mmol/L). Moreover, the greater mortality impact of hypernatremia may arise from its higher incidence among patients with CKD as the concentrating capacity of the kidney becomes impaired more readily than the diluting capacity. These findings should prompt consideration for disease-specific thresholds for sodium concentrations as opposed to a single range of sodium concentrations for all patients. Optimal thresholds for serum sodium based on real-life survival data may provide a more meaningful target for serum sodium values in clinical practice rather than our current practice of using values derived from cross-sectional population surveys.

### Antidiuretic hormone. normal and disordered function [^114gfB3V]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In humans and most other mammals, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a nonapeptide often referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP). It is produced by large neurons that originate in the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and project through the pituitary stalk to terminate on capillary plexuses scattered throughout the posterior pituitary. These plexuses drain into the systemic circulation by way of the cavernous sinus and superior vena cava.

### Urea to treat hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aNjKF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The use of urea to treat hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has not been universally adopted due to questions about effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addresses these questions.

Study Design

This PRISMA-guided study examined published research across 4 electronic databases.

Study Populations

Patients with SIADH-related hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria

Clinical trials and observational studies reporting at least 1 outcome related to serum sodium concentration, symptom resolution, or adverse effects after oral or nasogastric urea administration.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers using a standardized form recording study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and treatment outcomes.

Analytical Approach

A meta-analysis was conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood method for the random effects model to assess the effect of urea treatment on serum sodium and serum urea compared with other treatment modalities. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on treatment duration and SIADH severity.

Results

Urea treatment significantly increased serum sodium (mean difference [MD], 9.08 [95% CI, 7.64–10.52], P < 0.01) and urea (MD, 31.66 [95% CI, 16.05–47.26], P < 0.01) in patients with SIADH, albeit with significantly high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on the treatment duration showed a significant rise in the serum sodium level after 24 hours and 2, 5, 7, and 14 days, as well as after 1 year of treatment. Greater increases in serum sodium levels after treatment with urea occurred in patients with severe (< 120 mEq/L) (MD, 18.04 [95% CI, 13.68–22.39]) than with moderate (120–129 mEq/L) (MD, 7.86 [95% CI, 6.78–8.94]) or mild (130–135 mEq/L) (MD, 8.00 [95% CI, 7.31–8.69]) SIADH-induced hyponatremia. Urea treatment was comparable to fluid restriction (MD, 0.81 [95% CI, -0.93 to 2.55], P = 0.4) and vaptans (MD, -1.96 [95% CI, -4.59 to 0.66], P = 0.1) but superior to no treatment (MD, 7.99 [95% CI, 6.25–9.72], P < 0.01). Urea was associated with minor adverse events, with poor palatability being the most common.

Limitations

As no randomized controlled trials investigating urea as a treatment for hyponatremia were identified for inclusion, these analyses were based on observational studies.

Conclusions

Urea is safe and effective for managing SIADH-induced hyponatremia. These finding suggest that urea may be a useful treatment modality in resource-limited settings or when other treatments are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Vasopressin-dependent disorders: what is new in children? [^11319S3y]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-mediated osmoregulatory disorders, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) are common in the differential diagnosis for children with hypo- and hypernatremia and require timely recognition and treatment. DI is caused by a failure to concentrate urine secondary to impaired production of or response to AVP, resulting in hypernatremia. Newer methods of diagnosing DI include measuring copeptin levels; copeptin is AVP's chaperone protein and serves as a surrogate biomarker of AVP secretion. Intraoperative copeptin levels may also help predict the risk for developing DI after neurosurgical procedures. Copeptin levels hold diagnostic promise in other pediatric conditions, too. Recently, expanded genotype and phenotype correlations in inherited DI disorders have been described and may better predict the clinical course in affected children and infants. Similarly, newer formulations of synthetic AVP may improve pediatric DI treatment. In contrast to DI, SIADH, characterized by inappropriate AVP secretion, commonly leads to severe hyponatremia. Contemporary methods aid clinicians in distinguishing SIADH from other hyponatremic conditions, particularly cerebral salt wasting. Further research on the efficacy of therapies for pediatric SIADH is needed, although some adult treatments hold promise for pediatrics. Lastly, expansion of home point-of-care sodium testing may transform management of SIADH and DI in children. In this article, we review recent developments in the understanding of pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment of better outcomes and quality of life for children with these challenging disorders.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^112Vb4tm]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) in children — hyponatremia risk with hypotonic solutions is increased across settings, with risk persisting regardless of age, medical versus surgical status, and intensive care versus general pediatric ward setting. Mild and moderate hyponatremia were defined as serum sodium concentration < 135 mEq/L and < 130 mEq/L, with relative risks > 2 and > 5, respectively. Increased hyponatremia occurred in children with normal sodium at baseline (hospital-acquired hyponatremia) and those with low sodium concentration at baseline (hospital-aggravated hyponatremia), and the association was found when using both 0.2% saline (sodium 34 mEq/L) and 0.45% saline (sodium 77 mEq/L), including in patients receiving fluid at a restricted rate. A sensitivity analysis excluding the Shamim et al study revealed an overall estimated relative risk 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35–0.53) versus 0.46 (95% CI, 0.37–0.57) when all studies were included. In clinical trials assessing mechanism, elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration was found to play a putative role. Although some may argue that mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium 130–134 mEq/L) and moderate hyponatremia (plasma sodium 125–129 mEq/L) may not be clinically significant or constitute harm, the subcommittee believes that hyponatremia is an appropriate indicator of potential harm.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112DUB2Z]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, the reported prevalence of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, of all causes, varies considerably but is mostly in the range of 15% to 30% due to differing definitions of hyponatremia and patient populations studied. If mild hyponatremia is excluded, the percentage with serum sodium below 130 mmol/L is likely around 4% or less of patients, and those below 125 mmol/L around 2% or less. Existing studies are limited by their (mostly) retrospective design.

Older age is a strong risk factor for hyponatremia. This is particularly seen in hospitalized patients; in one study, those older than 80 years had an odds ratio (OR) of 10.88 (95% CI, 8.13–14.57) for developing profound hyponatremia less than 126 mmol/L in the hospital compared to patients younger than 30 years. Patients with hyponatremia also have higher average comorbidity scores compared to those with normal sodium. A study of 119 nonhospitalized residential care dwellers aged 60 or older reported that 18% had hyponatremia (< 136 mmol/L), compared to 8% of age-matched community-dwelling controls. While the association of hyponatremia with age is clear, observational studies alone cannot definitively separate the effects of age on hyponatremia susceptibility, as it is not possible to fully adjust for age-related comorbidities. Aging and frailty reduce the capacity to maintain homeostasis in response to environmental, disease-related, and iatrogenic disturbances in water balance. Mechanisms may include impaired thirst sensation, reduced total body water, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), loss of urinary concentrating capacity, decreased renal responsiveness to AVP, plus effects of accumulated comorbidities and medications. Age-associated reduction in kidney function occurs because of loss of parenchymal mass, tubulopathy, interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and microscopic arteriolar shunts. Data on AVP concentrations in older individuals are controversial, with some studies suggesting higher concentrations whereas others show no difference or lower concentrations. There is similar controversy regarding the effect of age on the AVP response both to inhibitory (ethanol) and secretory (hypertonic saline) stimuli. One trial observed reduced free water clearance in response to ethanol with age, and a greater increase in AVP in response to hypertonic saline in older compared to younger individuals despite similar free water clearance. An increased AVP response could compensate for the reduced renal ability to conserve salt and water with age and may be consistent with higher rates of SIAD seen in older individuals, if confirmed.

### Vasopressin excess and hyponatremia [^112HmCZY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that frequently is overlooked and undertreated. Although the pathophysiological process of hyponatremia is complex, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a common etiologic factor. Excess AVP release by osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli or both can lead to sodium and water imbalance. Conventional treatment options for hyponatremia, including water restriction and administration of sodium chloride with or without loop diuretics, do not directly address the underlying water retention induced by excess AVP in many cases. Clinical trials showed that AVP-receptor antagonists, including lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan, produce aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water, to correct serum sodium concentration. We review results from recent clinical trials involving AVP-receptor antagonists in the treatment of hyponatremia associated with AVP excess.

### Vasopressin regulation of renal sodium excretion [^113U8Pq8]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vasopressin promotes renal water reabsorption decreasing excretion of free water to dilute plasma and lower serum osmolality. We have good understanding of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of this vasopressin-dependent renal water movement. In comparison, vasopressin actions on renal electrolytes including sodium excretion and its consequences have been less well understood. This is so for investigation and discussions of the renal actions of vasopressin are framed primarily around water metabolism rather than any direct effect on salt handling. The fact that water moves in biological systems, to include the mammalian kidney, only by osmosis passively down its concentration gradient is implicit in such discussion but often not overtly addressed. This can cause confusion. Moreover, although vasopressin action on renal sodium excretion via the V2 receptor is critical to water transport, it is masked easily being situational — for instance, dependent on hydration state. It is now clear that an increase in sodium reabsorption along the distal nephron (CNT + CD) mediated by activation of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) by vasopressin makes an important contribution to maintenance of the axial corticomedullary osmotic gradient necessary for maximal water reabsorption. Thus, we need to modify slightly our understanding of vasopressin and its renal actions to include the idea that while vasopressin decreases free water excretion to dilute plasma, it does this, in part, by promoting sodium reabsorption and consequently decreasing sodium excretion via ENaC activated along the distal nephron.

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^113rohyY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality, is defined as serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, with its commonest cause being SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Except for patients with severe symptoms requiring treatment with hypertonic saline, the vast majority of patients with SIAD experience mild to moderate symptoms and receive fluid restriction as first-line therapy. The last major international guidelines, published in 2014, agreed on the limited evidence base of therapeutic approach, while they led to diverging recommendations with regard to the suggested second-line therapies. A US consensus statement suggests the use of tolvaptan as second-line agentin contrast to the European guidelines which do not recommend its use, suggesting oral urea instead. In the era of evidence-based medicine, there has been surprising sparsity of high-quality data for the treatment of SIAD until 2020, with the exception for placebo-controlled trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Fluid restriction, the mainstay treatment for SIAD in the last decades, had not been prospectively evaluated until recently. Real-world data have recorded its limited efficacy, with a response rate estimated at around 50%. Fluid restriction is also unlikely to achieve significant sodium correction in cases of limited free water excretion, such as when urine osmolality exceeds 500 mOsm/kg or the serum to urine electrolyte ratio is greater than 1. In 2020, the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid restriction for SIAD was published, showing significant, but modest, efficacy, as evidenced by a median sodium rise of 3 mmol/l over a 72-h period, with one third of patients being non-responders. These data highlight the need for additional therapies in a substantial proportion of patients. The choice of second-line therapy has been a subject to great debate with options including tolvaptan, urea, combination of furosemide and sodium chloride, demeclocycline, and, recently, empagliflozin.

### Vasopressin antagonists: role in the management of hyponatremia [^111PjRuv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration [Na+] are regulated by thirst, the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), and renal water and sodium handling. Hyponatremia is frequently caused by dysregulation of AVP, which accompanies disorders of water retention, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Clinical trials with AVP receptor antagonists have confirmed the important role of AVP in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia and suggest these agents are efficacious in treating hyponatremia associated with SIADH, cirrhosis, and CHF. Acting directly at AVP receptors in the renal tubules, these agents promote aquaresis - the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water - in patients with hyponatremia. In clinical trials, AVP receptor antagonists have been shown to increase the serum [Na⁺] and urine output while decreasing urine osmolality.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111yho3U]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Renal V2 receptors are located on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the collecting duct. Stimulation of the V2 receptor increases synthesis and insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels that increase water permeability, leading to increased reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate, resulting in water retention and more concentrated urine (Fig. 5). Additionally, AVP promotes water resorption by increasing the medullary interstitial osmotic gradient by increasing expression of epithelial Na + channels (ENaC) to increase sodium reabsorption, and by increasing urea transporters (UT-A1s) to increase urea reabsorption. These mechanisms increase the osmotic gradient in the renal interstitium to draw additional water from the filtrate, further contributing to urine concentration.

AVP can be viewed as an essential hormone to maintain tissue perfusion and defend against physiological and psychological stress. This essential importance of AVP to survival is demonstrated by the fact that hypothalamic AVP production is highly redundant, with clinical AVP deficiency (diabetes insipidus) manifesting only if more than 90% of hypothalamic AVP neurons are destroyed. Experiments in rodents show that the defenses against deviations of blood volume or osmolarity from their set points are very finely tuned. In hyperosmolar states, presentation of water-predicting cues reduces AVP-secreting neuron activity within seconds, even before water ingestion begins. Likewise, optogenetic experiments suggest that thirst-sensing neurons can predict how water consumption will alter fluid balance in the future and can adjust water intake behavior preemptively, including by increasing perceived swallowing effort.

SIAD is a consequence of AVP activity in excess of osmotic requirements. In SIAD, antidiuresis persists despite low serum tonicity and the absence of hypovolemia. Sustained stimulation of V2 receptors promotes aquaporin insertion into the cell membrane, leading to increased reabsorption of water, increased urine concentration, and, in the context of ongoing free water ingestion, a progressive decline in plasma sodium concentration. Additionally, to compensate for ECF volume expansion, aldosterone is suppressed and atrial natriuretic peptide increases, resulting in urinary sodium loss, a phenomenon also known as "pressure natriuresis". Thus, chronic hyponatremia due to SIAD is a state of whole-body sodium depletion in addition to water retention. Interestingly, in chronic SIAD a compensatory mechanism can occur via downregulation of V2R with reduction in aquaporin-2 expression, which can aid in limiting the free water excess.

### Cerebral salt wasting versus SIADH: what difference? [^112yF7YH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The term cerebral salt wasting (CSW) was introduced before the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was described in 1957. Subsequently, CSW virtually vanished, only to reappear a quarter century later in the neurosurgical literature. A valid diagnosis of CSW requires evidence of inappropriate urinary salt losses and reduced "effective arterial blood volume". With no gold standard, the reported measures of volume depletion do not stand scrutiny. We cannot tell the difference between CSW and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Furthermore, the distinction does not make a difference; regardless of volume status, hyponatremia complicating intracranial disease should be treated with hypertonic saline.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^116AH4cB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Physiology of hyponatraemia

In normal physiology, plasma sodium concentration is maintained within such tight parameters that clinical conditions in which hyponatraemia occur represent major abnormalities in the physiology of water balance. This tight homeostasis is achieved through the synergistic actions of the secretion and antidiuretic effect of vasopressin (AVP) and the activation of the thirst mechanism, resulting in day-to-day variations of plasma osmolality (determined by pNa) of less than 2%.

Changes in plasma osmolality are sensed by osmoreceptor cells in the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) and subfornical organ of the anterior hypothalamus. This initiates neural signals to the supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN), which depolarize, stimulating the synthesis and secretion of AVP. AVP is synthesised along with copeptin and neurophysin II, as a preprohormone, which is then cleaved into the three component parts during transport down the axons of the magnocellular neurons to the neurohypophysis, from where AVP is released into the systemic circulation. AVP binds to the V2 receptor in the collecting duct of the kidney, generating new aquaporin-2 (AQ2) and stimulating the insertion of preformed AQ2 into the luminal membrane of the collecting tubules. This action culminates in a reduction of free water clearance and concentration of urine. Increases in plasma osmolality also simultaneously stimulate the thirst centre in the cerebral cortex. The resulting increased fluid intake, combined with actions of AVP, lead to increased plasma water and normalisation of plasma osmolality.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Oncological emergencies associated with gastrointestinal tumors [^113uB81Q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)

SIADH occurs in approximately 1–2% of cancer patients. It should be suspected in any cancer patient with hyponatremia in combination with hypo-osmolality and high urine osmolality. It results from ADH-induced retention of ingested water. Ectopic production of ADH by a tumor is most often associated with lung carcinoma (especially small cell) but can also occur in other tumors such as head and neck cancer and rarely in GI tumors such as esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Antineoplastic drugs such as cisplatin are also well known to cause hyponatremia by a mechanism that may involve SIADH. Clinical symptoms depend on the level of hyponatremia and the rapidity of onset. Symptoms include changes in mental status, apathy, fatigue, headache, seizures and ultimately coma. Management involves control of the underlying tumor as well as fluid restriction of 500 mL to 1 L/day. In severe cases patients can be treated with hypertonic saline by slow infusion at a rate to increase the serum sodium level by 0.5–1.0 mEq/L/h. Sometimes isotonic saline is used as an alternative, however the electrolyte concentration of the administered fluid has to be greater than the concentration in urine, otherwise isotonic saline will not be effective and will even lead to further lowering of the serum sodium. Loop diuretics are only recommended when urine osmolality is more than twice the plasma osmolality thereby increasing water excretion.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^113XpNxi]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of Hyponatremia and Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

The frequency of hyponatremia depends on the definition used, clinical setting, and population studied, but is generally reported to affect 15% to 30% of acute hospital patients to some degree. Studies reporting rates at the lower end of this range tend to include admission values only and more restrictive sodium inclusion criteria (eg, pNa < 133–135 mmol/L), whereas rates at the higher end consider the whole hospital stay and use broader criteria (eg, < 136–138 mmol/L). Table 2 summarizes large, predominantly retrospective, studies of hyponatremia prevalence in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Many factors relevant to hospitalization can promote antidiuresis via stimulation of AVP (including stress-related factors such as pain and nausea); other contributors may include medications (eg, diuretics), hypotonic fluid administration, or reduction in heart, kidney, or liver function.

A prospective study confirmed the inverse correlation between baseline serum sodium levels and tolvaptan-induced sodium change, but it also identified low weight and body mass index (BMI) as predictors for a more rapid sodium rise. A prospective, observational, post-marketing, pharmacovigilance study, including 252 tolvaptan-treated patients with SIAD across several European countries, confirmed the great effectiveness of tolvaptan in sodium correction in combination with a high rate of around 25% for overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, most commonly in those with a lower starting sodium. The fact that the lower the baseline serum sodium concentration, the greater the magnitude of tolvaptan-induced sodium rise, was confirmed in further studies, and may merely reflect that subjects with more severe degree of hyponatraemia have greater room for improvement. Other biochemical parameters, such as urine sodium and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), were also identified as predictors for the rapidity of tolvaptan-induced sodium rise. The inverse correlation of baseline urine sodium with serum sodium rise may be explained by the competitive nature of the AVP antagonism exerted by tolvaptan, indicating that lower urine sodium represents lower degree of AVP activation and, therefore, predicting a higher response to tolvaptan. A possible explanation for the negative correlation with BUN, an observation also shown in relation to conivaptan-induced response, is that subjects with the lowest BUN levels may have the largest increase in whole body water content, greatest extracellular fluid expansion, highest glomerular filtration rate (GFR), lowest proximal tubular reabsorption and greatest distal delivery of substrate, thereby making them more responsive to water diuresis. Therefore, BUN may serve as a useful pre-treatment marker of response to vaptans, with patients with a very low BUN showing a larger sodium rise. Finally, acquired resistance to tolvaptan has rarely been described and has been attributed to escalating plasma AVP concentrations in the setting of progression of malignant disease, competing with tolvaptan at AVP kidney receptors.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: an update [^113ZUHV3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently seen in patients with ascites secondary to advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although not apparent in the early stages of cirrhosis, the progression of cirrhosis and portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, and this leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to ameliorate low circulatory volume. The net effect is the avid retention of sodium and water to compensate for the low effective circulatory volume, resulting in the development of ascites. These compensatory mechanisms lead to impairment of the kidneys to eliminate solute-free water in decompensated cirrhosis. Nonosmotic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin, further worsens excess water retention and thereby hyponatremia. The management of hyponatremia in this setting is a challenge as conventional therapies for hyponatremia including fluid restriction and correction of hypokalemia are frequently inefficacious. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, complications, and various treatment modalities, including albumin infusion, selective vasopressin receptor antagonists, or hypertonic saline for patients with severe hyponatremia and those awaiting liver transplantation.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^113VBoKn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

Exercise-induced hyponatremia — Hyponatremia occurs in both endurance athletes and recreational hikers due to physiologic mechanisms that result in failure of the kidneys to correct salt and fluid imbalances properly, with excess fluid retention when inappropriate levels of antidiuretic hormone influence the kidneys to both retain water and excrete sodium; sodium losses through sweat also contribute. In the field setting, altered mental status in a patient with normal body temperature and a history of taking in large volumes of water suggests hyponatremia. Excessive water ingestion is also a major contributor to exercise-associated hyponatremia; the recommendation to force fluid intake during prolonged exercise and the attitude that "you can't drink too much" is outdated.

### Is it cerebral or renal salt wasting? [^112ndk8z]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cerebral salt-wasting (CSW), or renal salt-wasting (RSW), has evolved from a misrepresentation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) to acceptance as a distinct entity. Challenges still confront us as we attempt to differentiate RSW from SIADH, ascertain the prevalence of RSW, and address reports of RSW occurring without cerebral disease. RSW is redefined as 'extracellular volume depletion due to a renal sodium transport abnormality with or without high urinary sodium concentration, presence of hyponatremia or cerebral disease with normal adrenal and thyroid function'. Our inability to differentiate RSW from SIADH lies in the clinical and laboratory similarities between the two syndromes and the difficulty of accurate assessment of extracellular volume. Radioisotopic determinations of extracellular volume in neurosurgical patients reveal renal that RSW is more common than SIADH. We review the persistence of hypouricemia and increased fractional excretion of urate in RSW as compared to correction of both in SIADH, the appropriateness of ADH secretion in RSW, and the importance of differentiating renal RSW from SIADH because of disparate treatment goals: fluid repletion in RSW and fluid restriction in SIADH. Patients with RSW are being incorrectly treated by fluid restriction, with clinical consequences. We conclude that RSW is common and occurs without cerebral disease, and propose changing CSW to RSW.

### Inhibition of antidiuretic hormone secretion by diphenylhydantoin… [^11721Qca]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

INCREASED secretion of antidiuretic hormone has been implicated in many hyponatremic disorders associated with impaired water excretion. This increased ADH release may be due to nonosmotic stimulation in response to volume depletion, to certain pharmacological agents, or frequently to an "inappropriate" ADH secretion secondary to tumors, pulmonary disease, or central nervous system disease. 1 The only previously known chemical inhibitor of ADH release other than water is ethanol. 2 More recently, Lee et al3 have shown that diphenylhydantoin corrected the impaired water excretion of two patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. To further clarify the mechanism of ADH inhibition by diphenylhydantoin sodium we have studied the effect of this drug in six patients with the inappropriate ADH syndrome and in eight normal subjects.

### Ethnic differences in urine concentration: possible relationship to blood pressure [^1167j8NT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The mechanisms that account for the susceptibility of black individuals to hypertension and their reduced ability to excrete sodium are poorly understood. Vasopressin administration has been shown in healthy humans to delay sodium excretion along with its antidiuretic action. Black individuals have been reported to have higher vasopressin levels than white individuals. Therefore, this study investigated retrospectively 24-h urine volume (V) and urine concentration index (urine-to-plasma ratio of creatinine concentration), as well as their possible relationships with BP, in a cohort of 141 healthy young black and white individuals (18 to 40 y). Black individuals were found to have a significantly lower V and higher urine concentration than white individuals, especially during daytime. In addition, they exhibited a blunted nocturnal fall in fluid and electrolyte excretion and a higher pulse pressure than white individuals. Higher urine concentration and lower V were associated significantly with higher PP (but not with systolic or diastolic BP) in men. These relations remained significant after adjustment for age, body mass index, and sodium and potassium excretion. These results suggest that an enhanced tendency to concentrate urine may delay the excretion of the daily ingested fluid and sodium and may increase pulse pressure in young normotensive individuals. The higher urine concentration that is observed in black individuals (which could represent an adaptation to better water conservation) may participate in their enhanced susceptibility to hypertension. If these results are confirmed in further studies, then vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists might offer a novel antihypertensive strategy, especially in the black population.

Mortality

A consistent association between hyponatremia and increased mortality is observed. Whether this is because multimorbid patients with serious underlying conditions are prone to develop hyponatremia, or whether hyponatremia itself is an independent risk factor, is not entirely clear and needs to be clarified in properly designed intervention studies.

A 2013 meta-analysis identified 81 studies comparing death rates in patients with or without hyponatremia, including a total of more than 850 000 patients (nearly 148 000 with hyponatremia). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.60; 95% CI, 2.31–2.93; P < .0001), and this was maintained after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The association was relatively consistent when analyzed by individual underlying condition (heart failure, cirrhosis, pulmonary infection, myocardial infarction). There was an inverse relationship between serum sodium concentration and mortality — indicating higher risk with lower sodium concentrations. The mean difference in serum sodium between individuals who died compared to survivors was 4.8 mmol/L (pNa 130.1 vs 134.9 mmol/L), so even hyponatremia in the mild range was associated with risk. A causal relationship was not able to be established, by the nature of this analysis. The consistency associated irrespective of the underlying condition suggests that the underlying mechanism, if hyponatremia is indeed causal, is not disease-specific.

A follow-up meta-analysis by the same group in 2015 sought to clarify this association by determining whether an improvement in serum sodium was associated with reduced risk of mortality. In total, 15 observational studies encompassing 13 816 patients, mean follow-up almost 3 years, that assessed the effects of an improved, or normalized, serum sodium on mortality were included. An improvement in serum sodium, through various interventions, was achieved in 53.2% of patients. Serum sodium improvement was associated with a reduced risk of death (OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.30–0.81; P = 0.002). A majority of the included patients had heart failure, which may limit applicability to the broader chronic hyponatremia cohort. Subsequent retrospective studies have reported that active management of hyponatremia is associated with improved mortality, discussed further in "Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis".

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116omhxd]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting more than 15% of patients in the hospital. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, previously known as antidiuretic hormone), which acts on the renal V2 receptors to promote water retention. There are a variety of underlying causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary pathology, and central nervous system pathology. In clinical practice, the etiology of hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial and the management approach may need to evolve during treatment of a single episode. It is therefore important to regularly reassess clinical status and biochemistry, while remaining alert to potential underlying etiological factors that may become more apparent during the course of treatment. In the absence of severe symptoms requiring urgent intervention, fluid restriction (FR) is widely endorsed as the first-line treatment for SIAD in current guidelines, but there is considerable controversy regarding second-line therapy in instances where FR is unsuccessful, which occurs in around half of cases. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of SIAD, and summarize recent evidence for therapeutic options beyond FR, with a focus on tolvaptan, urea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### Physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment [^115LjJpK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Dehydration (body water deficit) is a physiologic state that can have profound implications for human health and performance. Unfortunately, dehydration can be difficult to assess, and there is no single, universal gold standard for decision making. In this article, we review the physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment. We highlight how phenomenologic interpretations of dehydration depend critically on the type (dehydration compared with volume depletion) and magnitude (moderate compared with severe) of dehydration, which in turn influence the osmotic (plasma osmolality) and blood volume-dependent compensatory thresholds for antidiuretic and thirst responses. In particular, we review new findings regarding the biological variation in osmotic responses to dehydration and discuss how this variation can help provide a quantitative and clinically relevant link between the physiology and phenomenology of dehydration. Practical measures with empirical thresholds are provided as a starting point for improving the practice of dehydration assessment.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Renal physiology of nocturia [^114amuNo]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Renal function, diurnal fluctuations in arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, sex, and advanced age affect urine formation and may contribute to nocturia. Renal effects of AVP are mediated by AVP V2 receptors in the kidney collecting duct. Changes in AVP concentration have the greatest relative effects on urine volume when AVP levels are low; therefore small changes can have a large effect on renal water excretion. AVP is the major regulator of water excretion by the kidneys, and AVP levels have been shown to affect nocturnal voiding. Results of several studies show that patients with nocturia had no significant variation in plasma AVP, whereas patients without nocturia had significant diurnal variation in plasma AVP. The V2 receptor gene is located on the X chromosome, which has important sex-specific consequences. For example, mutations in the V2 gene can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, predominantly in men. Age-related changes in water metabolism are associated with overall body composition, kidney, and brain. Older people generally experience decreased extracellular fluid and plasma volume, which leads to increased adverse consequences from net body water gain or loss. Renal function declines with age, and the ability to concentrate urine and conserve sodium is reduced in the elderly. Thirst perception is also decreased in the elderly, who, compared with younger people, tend to hypersecrete AVP in response to higher plasma osmolality, possibly resulting in hyponatremia. These aspects of renal physiology should be considered when antidiuretic drugs are prescribed for the treatment of nocturia.

### Sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate (sodium phosphates) [^115S5tSq]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenously infused phosphate not taken up by the tissues is excreted almost entirely in the urine. Plasma phosphate is believed to be filterable by the renal glomeruli, and the major portion of filtered phosphate (greater than 80%) is actively reabsorbed by the tubules. Many modifying influences tend to alter the amount excreted in the urine.

Sodium is the principal cation of extracellular fluid. It comprises more than 90% of the total cations at its normal plasma concentration of approximately 142 mEq/L. While the sodium ion can diffuse across cell membranes, intracellular sodium is maintained at a much lower concentration than extracellular sodium through the expenditure of energy by the cell (so-called "sodium cation pump"). Loss of intracellular potassium ion is usually accompanied by an increase in intracellular sodium ion.

When serum sodium concentration is low, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary is inhibited, thereby preventing water reabsorption by the distal renal tubules. On the other hand, adrenal secretion of aldosterone increases renal tubular reabsorption of sodium in an effort to re-establish normal serum sodium concentration.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11183jyJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for "autocorrection" of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Prevention and correction of dysnatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116fiu5a]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysnatremia occurs commonly in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The mechanisms for development of sodium dyshomeostasis are complex, including the cerebral salt-wasting syndrome, the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, diabetes insipidus. Iatrogenic occurrence of altered sodium levels plays a role, as sodium homeostasis is tightly linked to fluid and volume management.

Methods

Narrative review of the literature.

Results

Many studies have aimed to identify factors predictive of the development of dysnatremia, but data on associations between dysnatremia and demographic and clinical variables are variable. Furthermore, although a clear relationship between serum sodium serum concentrations and outcomes has not been established-poor outcomes have been associated with both hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the immediate period following aSAH and set the basis for seeking interventions to correct dysnatremia. While sodium supplementation and mineralocorticoids are frequently administered to prevent or counter natriuresis and hyponatremia, evidence to date is insufficient to gauge the effect of such treatment on outcomes.

Conclusions

In this article, we reviewed available data and provide a practical interpretation of these data as a complement to the newly issued guidelines for management of aSAH. Gaps in knowledge and future directions are discussed.

### Adenotonsillectomy normalizes hormones and urinary electrolytes in children with nocturnal enuresis and sleep-disordered breathing [^111JjPv8]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess (1) plasma levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and urinary levels of electrolytes in children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB), with or without nocturnal enuresis (NE), and (2) the effect of adenotonsillectomy (T&A) on urinary electrolytes and the secretion of ADH and BNP in children with NE and SDB. We previously reported post-T&A improvements in plasma levels of BNP and ADH in children with SDB and NE. However, the differences in plasma concentration of these hormones in SDB children with and without NE, and their relationships with urinary electrolytes, have not yet been addressed.

Methods

This prospective study compared concentrations of urinary electrolytes and plasma ADH and BNP in (1) children with SDB and NE (study group) and an age- and sex-matched control group of children with SDB without NE, and (2) the study group before and 1-month after T&A.

Results

Compared with the control group (n = 31), the study group (n = 37) exhibited significantly lower ADH (P = 0.04) and higher BNP (P = 0.009) plasma levels. The differences in urinary electrolytes were not significant. Post-T&A, the study group showed significantly decreased BNP (P = 0.018), urinary sodium-to-creatinine ratio (P = 0.02), and urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio (P = 0.007) compared with the pre-T&A values. Post-T&A changes in urinary calcium were significantly correlated with changes in sodium excretion (P = 0.002) and in plasma levels of BNP (P < .001).

Conclusion

The presence of NE is associated with altered ADH and BNP levels in children with SDB. T&A led to normalization of ADH and BNP, probably through a calcium- and sodium-dependent mechanism.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112wNUbn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

SIAD has been classified into a number of distinct pathophysiological categories based on evaluation of AVP concentrations (Fig. 6). This was pioneered by Zerbe and colleagues, who measured AVP concentration before and after raising the serum osmolality with hypertonic saline in patients with SIAD, and identified 4 patterns of AVP response, known as types A to D. These phenotypes correlate with certain etiologies; however, whether the categories are clinically meaningful or simply a vehicle for better understanding pathophysiology is less clear. Type A refers to a persistently raised AVP concentration regardless of an increase in serum osmolality, which occurs in the most common forms of SIAD due to ongoing "inappropriate" AVP secretion either from the pituitary or a paraneoplastic source. Type B is characterized by a lower osmotic threshold for AVP secretion ("reset osmostat"), with serum sodium typically stably maintained at a lower level of 125 to 135 mmol/L, in which AVP will still suppress at lower osmolarities than this (unless another intercurrent pathology occurs). This pattern may be more common in older age. Rarer patterns include type C, characterized by an abnormal AVP response only at low osmolalities, potentially due to dysfunction of inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus, and type D, in which AVP is undetectable, either because of secretion of an unidentified antidiuretic substance from tumor cells, or alternatively, a gain-of-function mutation in the V2 receptor (ie, nephrogenic SIAD). More recently, the same patterns have been shown for copeptin, even pointing to a fifth novel SIAD subtype discovered in 20% of patients that was characterized by a linear decrease in copeptin concentrations with increasing serum osmolality (type E), which may represent a "reset barostat", or could be consistent with resolution of acute type A SIAD (see Fig. 6). Whether treatment responses and patient outcomes will vary according to SIAD subtype is still to be investigated.

### Prognostic consequences of borderline dysnatremia: pay attention to minimal serum sodium change [^114mpKda]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This large multicenter cohort study, focusing specifically on dysnatremia at ICU admission, demonstrates that this electrolyte disorder is common and is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. This study confirms that mild hypernatremia and moderate hyponatremia (that is serum sodium concentration < 130 mmol/L or > 145 mmol/L respectively) are independently associated with poor outcome.

In this study, one-third of critically ill patients had a moderate to severe dysnatremia at ICU. Mild to severe hypernatremia and hyponatremia were present in respectively 7.8% and 27.4% of the admitted patients. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. Up to 40% of the overall population of hospitalized patients has a hyponatremia at admission. Presence of severe hyponatremia on hospital admission has been demonstrated to be independently associated with an increased risk for ICU admission and poor prognosis. Hyponatremia may be due to chronic organ dysfunctions (that is heart failure or liver dysfunction) but also to diuretic use, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, adrenal insufficiency, and cerebral or renal salt wasting syndromes. Each of these conditions is frequently encountered in critically ill patients and may explain the high prevalence of hyponatremia at ICU admission. Similarly, although less frequent than hyponatremia, several studies demonstrated hypernatremia to be common at ICU admission. Since thirst and free access to water are the most important mechanisms that prevent hypernatremia, critically ill patients and older patients are at high risk for this disorder. Only 2.5% patients have been found to develop moderate to severe hypernatremia in the general in-hospital population of patients. Higher prevalence has been reported in geriatric or critically ill patients.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117HhZgC]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Even in high sodium-loss states, normal dietary sodium intake is almost always adequate to maintain normal plasma sodium concentration. The usual recommended daily dietary sodium intake (∼ 100 mmol/d) contains twice as much sodium as a typical dose of salt tablets (3 g daily, eg, 5×600 mg tablets = 51 mmol Na +) — and many Western diets exceed these sodium guidelines. This quantity of sodium is equivalent to just over half a teaspoon of table salt (2.85 g = 47.4 mmol), or 100 mL of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride solution (51.3 mmol). Some recommended regimens for salt tablets are even higher, 9 g per day (3×1 g, 3 times daily = 154 mmol) aiming to produce an osmotic diuresis.

The only RCT of sodium chloride tablets evaluated them in combination with FR and furosemide, in a trial of 92 patients with SIAD. The trial involved 3 open-label arms: FR alone; FR + furosemide (20–40 mg daily); and FR + furosemide + salt tablets (3 g [51 mmol] per day, 10×300 mg tablets, in divided doses). Mean baseline pNa was 125 mmol/L. This study, the highest-quality evidence to date, found no difference in time taken for serum sodium concentration to normalize in those patients prescribed salt tablets compared to FR and furosemide, or FR alone (P = 0.5), and found higher rates of treatment withdrawal due to adverse events (20%, vs 6% and 10% in other arms; P = 0.03), namely increased acute kidney injury (P = 0.07) and significant hypokalemia less than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L (P = 0.01). By increasing thirst, salt tablets may increase water intake and worsen hyponatremia if the amount of fluid intake exceeds that of the extra urine volume excreted via salt-mediated solute diuresis. Whether higher doses of oral sodium chloride without furosemide are effective and safe has not been subject to RCTs.

Sodium supplementation may have a role where there is suspected solute depletion from long-term diuretic therapy or a low-solute diet in tandem with SIAD. Despite their popularity, there is no compelling evidence for efficacy of salt tablets in SIAD.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^113tpb9e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We systematically searched previous studies including patients with SIADH who received urea treatment. In the 23 studies analyzed, 537 patients with SIADH were reported and 462 were treated with urea as the only therapy. Due to the absence of randomized clinical trials, in particular ones with adequate sample sizes, there is no definite evidence for the efficiency of urea in the treatment of hyponatremia in patients with SIADH. However, the available, lower-quality evidence suggests that urea is an effective treatment option with a very low risk of overcorrection and rarely reported adverse effects aside from dysgeusia.

In the pooled analysis we present here, urea increased serum sodium by 10.2 mmol/L within the reported follow-up time and seemed to be as effective in increasing serum sodium concentration as the VRA tolvaptan (serum sodium increase of 10.4 mmol/L until end of follow up). The rise in serum sodium starts as early as 24 to 48 hours after treatment initiation. Nearly all reported patients improved their serum sodium concentration with urea treatment to a level above 130 mmol/L. The average urea dose in the 23 studies was 15 g to 30 g urea per day with no reported adjustment to urine osmolality. For context, the dose recommendation in the European guidelines for treatment of SIADHwith urea is 0.25 to 0.50 g/kg per day. Urea raises serum sodium by increasing free water excretion through an osmotic-diuretic mechanism. The amount of free water excretion and therefore effectiveness of urea depends among others on the applied dose of urea and the urine osmolality. With increasing urine osmolality, the necessary dose of urea to improve serum sodium is higher. A practical guideline on dosing of urea in hyponatremia patients with regard to the initial urine osmolality exists. The risk of overcorrection of serum sodium concentration with urea is very low. Overcorrection is assumed to be a major contributor to the development of ODS even though a recent work showed only very low incidences of ODS in a large retrospective cohort of patients with hyponatremia and found no correlation between rapid corrections of serum sodium and ODS. Of note, the incidence was higher in patients with serum sodium below 110 mmol/L and overcorrection should, in our opinion, still be avoided especially in high-risk patients. The risk for ODS is still a matter of concern, and especially in patients at higher risk urea might be a safe and effective therapeutic option. However, in animal models, urea seemed to protect from ODS. Regarding the most common adverse effect of urea, dysgeusia, previous studies suggest that taste of urea can be improved by adding sucrose and citric acidor by dissolving urea in sweetened beverages.

### Vaptans for the treatment of hyponatremia [^114ThkwS]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The vaptans constitute a new class of pharmaceuticals developed for the treatment of the hypervolemic and euvolemic forms of hyponatremia. These agents are nonpeptide vasopressin antagonists that interfere with the antidiuretic effect of the hormone by competitively binding to V(2) receptors in the kidney. This blockade results in water diuresis (aquaresis) that, if not offset by increased fluid intake, reduces body water content and raises plasma sodium levels. Probably as a result of this rise in plasma sodium, thirst and plasma vasopressin concentration increase, potentionally limiting the effects of the vasopressin antagonists. Nonetheless, vaptans are particularly useful to treat hypervolemic hyponatremia associated with severe congestive heart failure or chronic liver failure, as the only other treatments currently available, such as fluid restriction and diuretics, are slow-acting and minimally effective. Vaptans are also useful for treating euvolemic hyponatremia associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), at least when it is chronic and/or minimally symptomatic. However, because their effects vary unpredictably from patient to patient, vaptans are less useful than hypertonic saline infusion in cases of acute, severe and symptomatic hyponatremia. Vaptan therapy is absolutely contraindicated in hypovolemic hyponatremia (in which total body water is reduced) and is ineffective in the vasopressin-independent form of inappropriate antidiuresis caused by constitutive activating mutations of V(2) receptors.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Sleep-related breathing disorders and lower urinary tract dysfunction in children and adolescents: a scoping review [^114jLqvo]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Different hypotheses were stated to explain the prevalence of NE in children and adolescents with OSA/SDB. First, children/adolescents with sleep apnea experience limitations in their sleep cycle, which could affect different body functions including bladder control. Since the sleep cycles in children and adolescents with sleep apnea are disturbed, they can become easily fatigued. This state of fatigue could reduce the overall alertness, which may impact the child's or adolescent's ability to control the bladder. Furthermore, it could lead to an insufficient arousal response at night, which may impact the child's or adolescent's ability to wake up when bladder pressure increases. Second, impaired urodynamics, which involves an increase in intra‐abdominal pressure, caused by respiratory efforts against an obstructed airway. This pressure can be transmitted to the bladder leading to NE, Third, neurological impact: sleep apnea might cause a decrease in oxygen saturation. As the brain is in constant need of oxygen, low levels of oxygen can impair brain functions, especially affecting areas responsible for bladder function. This may also lead to the loss of bladder control. Fourth, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels: both natriuretic peptides work together and are involved in regulating our body's fluid balance and sodium homeostasis. OSA may increase levels of urinary hormones such as ANP and BNP due to upper airway obstruction. Increased ANP can lead to greater urine production at night (i.e. polyuria), overwhelming the bladder's capacity during sleep. This could increase the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) secretion, which increases the release of water and sodium excretion. In fact, Capdeville et al show that NE children have higher levels of BNP compared to non‐NE children at any degree of severity of SDB. And finally, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion: ADH is a hormone released by the hypothalamus and it promotes water reabsorption in the kidneys, reducing urine output and concentrating the urine. Therefore, disruptions to ADH could also increase urine production at night which may lead to enuretic episodes at night. Despite the evidence found in some of the studies involving these hypotheses, two other studies conclude that the exact cause of the association with NE and OSA remains unclear.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115cSj3z]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SIADH, a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, who may have SIADH as the underlying cause.

The diagnostic criteria consist of essential and supplemental components. The essential criteria include effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, absence of clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia, urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake, absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary or renal insufficiency, and no recent use of diuretic agents.

The supplemental criteria, which provide additional diagnostic support, include serum uric acid less than 0.24 mmol/L, serum urea less than 3.6 mmol/L, failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion, fractional sodium excretion greater than 0.5%, fractional urea excretion greater than 55%, fractional uric acid excretion greater than 12%, and correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction.

The Diagnostic Criteria for SIADH is a comprehensive tool that incorporates a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters, providing a robust framework for the diagnosis of this complex disorder.

The diagnostic criteria calculator for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is designed to analyze clinical criteria that can indicate the presence of this condition. It evaluates 13 specific criteria, each associated with a distinct point value. Responses to these criteria are typically marked as either true or false.

Here's how the criteria are scored:

- Effective serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg carries a weight of 8 points.
- Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg is assigned 8 points.
- No clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia also grants 8 points.
- Urine sodium concentration > 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake merits 8 points.
- Absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, or renal insufficiency scores 8 points.
- No recent use of diuretic agents is worth 8 points.
- Serum uric acid < 0.24 mmol/L or < 4 mg/dL earns 1 point.
- Serum urea < 3.6 mmol/L or < 21.6 mg/dL contributes 1 point.
- Failure to correct hyponatremia after a 0.9% saline infusion results in 1 point.
- Fractional sodium excretion > 0.5% leads to 1 point.
- Fractional urea excretion > 55% scores 1 point.
- Fractional uric acid excretion > 12% provides 1 point.
- Correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction adds 1 point.

The calculator sums the points for criteria that are marked true, resulting in a total score that is used to interpret the likelihood of SIADH being present. The interpretation process is as follows:

- If the total score is 7 or below, the criteria for SIADH are not met, suggesting that the condition is unlikely.
- A score ranging from 8 to 47 indicates that the criteria for possible SIADH are met, which implies a potential diagnosis.
- A score of 48 or higher confirms that the criteria for definite SIADH have been met, suggesting a strong likelihood of the condition.

This scoring and interpretation framework aids in systematically assessing whether the clinical criteria for SIADH are fulfilled.

### Position effect on antidiuretic hormone… [^11761rpG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

HYPONATREMIA occurs commonly in patients with severe intracranial disease or head injury who are maintained on a normal intake of water. Such patients typically have hyperosmotic urine and urine-to-serum osmolal ratios greater than one. These findings could result from dehydration and sodium loss. However, when they occur in hydrated patients, particularly those who have received an adequate intake of sodium, it is assumed that the blood level of antidiuretic hormone is elevated; a dilute urine, therefore, cannot be elaborated and, if the water intake is maintained at the usual level, hyponatremia occurs. This series of events was termed the "syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" by Schwartz et al1 in 1957. Since that time, an impressive body of direct and indirect evidence has shown that the blood ADH level is elevated in these circumstances. It is generally believed that the lesion producing the intracranial disease.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na⁺] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na⁺] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^113nG35Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is defined by a serum sodium (Na) concentration < 135 mmol/L. It is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients at a rate of 15–30%. A prospective cohort study of 98,411 hospitalised patients demonstrated that even mild hyponatraemia (Na 130–134 mmol/L) is associated with increased mortality in hospital (OR 1.37), at 1 year (OR 1.35) and at 5 years post discharge (OR 1.24).

Traditionally, hyponatraemia is classified clinically by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. The most common cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is characterized by dysregulated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, despite low serum Na and osmolality. Diagnostic criteria include: euvolaemic state, normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels, serum Na < 135 mmol/L, reduced serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/Kg and urine Na > 30 mmol/L.

In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium

Overcorrection of serum sodium can occur as a consequence of any sodium-raising intervention, or may occur spontaneously with the resolution of a reversible stimulus for AVP secretion or cessation of excessive water input, and subsequent aquaresis. There is no evidence that spontaneous overcorrection of chronic (> 48 h) hyponatremia is any safer than iatrogenic overcorrection. To maintain the rate of correction within the target range, "relowering" of serum sodium can be achieved with administration of hypotonic fluid, with or without iatrogenic AVP therapy (desmopressin, DDAVP) to suspend urine output (see Figs. 8 and 10), and of course ceasing any active sodium-increasing therapy. Because the symptoms of ODS are delayed by several days, relowering remains essential for patients who are asymptomatic — but may also improve symptoms and outcomes for those with early clinical ODS.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116WdLtD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic Hyponatremia

In chronic hyponatremia of duration greater than 48 hours, the brain adapts to a lower pNa, with a corresponding reduction in brain tissue osmolality, because of an influx of water and export of osmolytes (see Fig. 3). Chronic hyponatremia was previously considered to be "asymptomatic", but it is now recognized that while severe symptoms may be absent, it can be associated with cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, plus vulnerability to acute exacerbations of hyponatremia. Clinical features associated with chronic hyponatremia may include nausea, vertigo, confusion, muscle cramps, weakness, headache, restlessness, dysarthria, and hyporeflexia. There is preclinical evidence to suggest that cellular function, for example, enzymatic activity, is compromised when intracellular osmolality is reduced. Furthermore, the intracellular organic osmolytes that become depleted in chronic hyponatremia can play a vital role in neurotransmission and protein synthesis, factors that may explain clinical sequelae of chronic hyponatremia.

The evidence linking clinical symptoms to chronic hyponatremia is largely observational, and there is no prospective interventional study to demonstrate conclusively that correction of chronic hyponatremia, which is commonly biochemically mild, can improve such features. The literature is potentially further confounded by the fact that clinical features attributable to hyponatremia are nonspecific and have a relatively high background prevalence in the normonatremic population. Observational studies can never fully adjust for confounders, and reverse causality remains a possibility, meaning that hyponatremia may be a marker of poor health, rather than a pathogenic mediator. Likewise, there is a recognized association between chronic hyponatremia and increased mortality, though causation, or the direction thereof, is not yet established. For some of these chronic hyponatremia-associated clinical features, there is mechanistic evidence from preclinical studies supporting biologic plausibility, as discussed later.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11168QRU]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^1113PhXj]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

UNa concentration is a very useful discriminator of ECF volume status. This is because in hypovolemic hyponatremia the mechanisms to conserve sodium remain intact, resulting in low UNa excretion — however, in SIAD there is ongoing renal sodium loss. UNa concentrations can vary considerably, even in serial samples hour to hour, so the exact value is not as useful as whether it is above or below an approximate threshold of 30 mmol/L (according to current European guidelines, or 20–30 mmol/L according the expert panel guidelines). Because of measurement variability and other factors, it is difficult to determine a strict UNa cutoff for diagnosis. Different sources have set the UNa threshold for SIAD diagnosis at varying levels, including greater than 20 mmol/L, greater than 30 mmol/L, greater than 40 mmol/L, or even greater than 50 mmol/L. The original description of SIAD by Bartter and Schwartz referred to "continued renal excretion of sodium" without quantifying a threshold, an approach also taken by some contemporary sources, perhaps to avoid this controversy. Because UNa is a continuous variable under multifactorial influence, setting a higher threshold will increase the specificity of SIAD diagnosis but decrease sensitivity, and vice versa for a lower threshold (Fig. 9). Given this variability, and because volume status can change over time, repeated UNa measurements may be useful. Logically, the closer to the threshold, the greater the value in continued reevaluation. A low UNa may also develop with resolution of transient SIAD as the retained water begins to be excreted, so this finding does not totally rule out SIAD having been present. Clinical history and assessment of urine output are key to differentiating this scenario from hypovolemia.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: an ignored clinical syndrome? [^113sAYkf]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes Insipidus and Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion After Traumatic Brain Injury

Injury to the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, or pituitary stalk may cause water and electrolyte abnormalities. DI occurs because of underproduction of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalance. For diagnosing DI, exclusion of the effect of osmotic agents and hyperglycemia is paramount. The diagnostic criteria for DI are given in Table 1. The incidence of severe DI with gross hypernatremia was found to be 2.9%. In the early period after injury, the overall incidence of DI is about 22–26%. Patients with TBI have impaired consciousness, as well as nausea, vomiting, and pain, and receive osmotic diuretics for raised ICP, leading to decreased total intake. Occurrence of polyuria leads to much more water loss, resulting in a negative water balance. The consequent hypernatremia and dehydration add to the morbidity. It has been suggested that patients with features of acute DI should undergo screening for anterior pituitary dysfunction. Though most of the times it is transient, still in around 6.9% of the patients with TBI, DI may persist even 6–36 months after injury.

Hyponatremia (Na level < 135 mmol/l) is the most common (20%) electrolyte abnormality seen after TBI. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been observed in 12.7% of patients with TBI in the acute phase. It is also usually transient but can cause hyponatremia, increase cerebral edema, and even precipitate seizures. Acute ACTH deficiency can coexist in patients with TBI and is one of the reasons for hyponatremia. For making a diagnosis of SIADH, glucocorticoid deficiency, severe hypothyroidism, and the antiseizure drug carbamazepine need to be excluded. Patients who develop hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia are likely to have ACTH deficiency and should be screened for it.

### Desmopressin acetate injection, USP, 4 mcg / mL… [^117EpDBt]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

Desmopressin acetate injection, USP 4 mcg/mL is a synthetic analogue of the natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone affecting renal water conservation. It is chemically defined as follows: Mol. Wt.
1069. 23. Desmopressin acetate, USP, 4 mcg Sodium chloride, 9 mg Hydrochloric acid to adjust pH to 4 Water for injection, q. s. to 1 mL The 10 mL vial contains chlorobutanol as a preservative. Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL contains as active substance, desmopressin acetate, USP, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. One mL of desmopressin acetate solution has an antidiuretic activity of about 16 IU; 1 mcg of desmopressin acetate is equivalent to 4 IU. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine.

A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment receiving single dose desmopressin acetate injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. Hemophilia A: Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5%. Desmopressin acetate injection will often maintain hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A during surgical procedures and postoperatively when administered 30 minutes prior to scheduled procedure. An oral LD50 has not been established. An intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg in mice demonstrated no effect.

Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease: Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL is administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 0. 3 mcg desmopressin acetate/kg body weight diluted in sterile physiological saline and infused slowly over 15 to 30 minutes.

### Hyponatremia in neurotrauma: the role of vasopressin [^1145uhZg]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequent in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or following intracranial procedures, with approximately 20% having a decreased serum sodium concentration to < 125mmol/L. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia in neurotrauma is not completely understood, but in large part is explained by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The abnormal water and/or sodium handling creates an osmotic gradient promoting the shift of water into brain cells, thereby worsening cerebral edema and precipitating neurological deterioration. Unless hyponatremia is corrected promptly and effectively, morbidity and mortality increases through seizures, elevations in intracranial pressure, and/or herniation. The excess mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia (< 125mmol/L) extends beyond the time frame of hospital admission, with a reported mortality of 20% in hospital and 45% within 6 months of follow-up. Current options for the management of hyponatremia include fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, mineralocorticoids, and osmotic diuretics. However, the recent development of vasopressin receptor antagonists provides a more physiological tool for the management of excess water retention and consequent hyponatremia, such as occurs in SIADH. This review summarizes the existing literature on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of hyponatremia in the setting of neurotrauma.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", that is, early empirical coadministration both of desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach would be that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolonging of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (eg, paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours, 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium greater than 10 mmol/L at 24 hours, but no adverse effects were reported. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support this strategy, and instead we endorse a "reactive" or "rescue" approach to desmopressin therapy, in keeping with current guidelines.

### Multiphase management of sodium imbalance following traumatic brain injury: a case-based review [^116w76gQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This case report is important because it exemplifies a rare but clinically significant sequence of sodium disturbances — osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), and subsequent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) — following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These phases often overlap, mimic one another, or transition rapidly, making diagnosis and management highly challenging. The case emphasizes:

The Triphasic Pattern – Often overlooked in clinical practice, the unmasking of AVD following mannitol-induced diuresis and eventual transition to SIAD is under-recognized but crucial for guiding treatment decisions.
Dynamic Pathophysiology –The triphasic response mechanism is believed to involve an initial phase of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) caused by transient dysfunction or "stunning" of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-secreting neurons, followed by a second phase of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to uncontrolled ADH release, and finally a third phase of permanent CDI resulting from depletion of ADH stores and irreversible loss of ADH production in the posterior pituitary.
Clinical Relevance – Mismanagement (e.g. giving fluids in SIAD or restricting them in AVD) can lead to devastating complications like cerebral edema, seizures, or demyelination.
Teachable Value – The case serves as a high-yield clinical learning opportunity for ICU physicians, pediatricians, and neurologists, especially with its clear timeline, management strategies, and a schematic protocol for differentiation.
Gap in Literature – There are limited pediatric case reports systematically describing all three phases and offering practical ICU management tools in such a structured format.

In sum, the case bridges a gap between theory and bedside care, offering both a cautionary tale and a practical guide for optimizing outcomes in critically ill TBI patients.

Pathophysiology of Sodium Imbalance in Traumatic Brain Injury:

Sodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. (Tables 1 and 2) Initial osmotic diuresis is a common consequence of mannitol use and may exacerbate sodium derangement, particularly in unconscious or altered-consciousness patients, where fluid intake may be inadequate. Vasopressin deficiency (formerly central DI) arises due to hypothalamic or pituitary injury, impairing vasopressin secretion or release and causing polyuria and hypernatremia if patients cannot compensate with adequate fluid intake. SIAD results from non-osmotic vasopressin release, leading to water retention, concentrated urine, and dilutional hyponatremia. (Table 2. Diagnostic Clues in Sodium Imbalance, Table 3: Differentiation table).

Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion and TCMP

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a form of euvolemic, hypo‐osmolar hyponatremia, which is characterized by a negative free water clearance with high urine osmolality and low plasma osmolality in the absence of renal, adrenal, and thyroid insufficiency. 131 The causes of SIADH can include malignancy (small‐cell lung cancer, lymphoma), central nervous system–related causes (infections, mass, trauma, bleed), iatrogenic (psychoactive drugs, chemotherapy), pulmonary disorders, and, rarely, genetic causes. The clinical presentation and morbidity and mortality associated with SIADH are related to severity and rapidity of onset as well as duration of hyponatremia. Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are usually limited to the central nervous system and occur typically at sodium levels < 125 mEq/L. Cardiac manifestations in hyponatremia are not common but recently TCMP has been described in patients with severe hyponatremia in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and SIADH. 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139 Hyponatremia has been shown to exist in 32.1% of cases of TCMP. 140 However, many of the cases demonstrating a relationship between hyponatremia and TCMP had confounding factors present such as hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and seizures. Table 5 summarizes all the cases with confirmed diagnoses of SIADH associated with TCMP.

Pathogenesis of sodium and water perturbations in patients who had a stroke

Hyponatraemia

In acute stroke, AVP release from the posterior pituitary secretory granules is stimulated by various factors, including increased serum hyperosmolality, hypovolaemia due to decreased fluid intake, nausea, stress, pain and drugs (eg, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Water retention or (less often) loss of effective solutes (sodium and potassium) in excess of water can also lead to hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia caused by water retention occurs only under conditions that impair renal water excretion and does not tend to occur in patients with primary polydipsia in which excessive water intake can overwhelm the normal renal excretory capacity. The higher the plasma AVP, the more concentrated the urine. In most patients with SIADH, increasing water consumption does not adequately suppress AVP, and the urine remains concentrated. This leads to water retention, which increases total body water that subsequently lowers serum sodium levels by a dilutional effect. Additionally, the increase in total body water transiently expands the extracellular fluid volume causing increased urinary sodium excretion, which returns the extracellular fluid volume towards normal and further lowers serum sodium levels. Besides renal failure, primary polydipsia and low dietary solute intake, the majority of causes of hyponatraemia are associated with an absolute or relative excess of AVP (despite the presence of hypotonicity) often caused by SIADH or depletion of effective circulating intravascular volume.

### Evaluation and management of hyponatremia: an emerging role for vasopressin receptor antagonists [^113eqJq4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, collectively known as the 'vaptans', provide a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia; therefore, an updated Review of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia is particularly timely. After briefly defining hyponatremia and introducing its clinical aspects and complications, we present an approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of hyponatremia that is based primarily on the often-underused concept of free water clearance and, more specifically, the electrolyte-free water clearance. Then we review the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in the management of hyponatremia from the standpoint of their pharmacology, their mechanism of action, and available efficacy data from clinical trials.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cGVeF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The Hyponatremia Intervention Trial (HIT) is a large, international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) currently underway aiming to recruit 2278 hospitalized participants with pNa less than 130 mmol/L to be allocated 1:1 to receive either targeted correction of sodium concentration or standard care. The trial will include patients with hyponatremia irrespective of underlying cause or volume status. Targeted correction will aim to be achieved by adhering to predetermined diagnostic and treatment algorithms. The primary outcome will be death or rehospitalization within 30 days, and secondary outcomes will include measures of falls, fractures, hyponatremia recurrence, quality of life, and adverse events (eg, ODS). The results of this trial will provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that intervention to correct hyponatremia improves clinical outcomes.

Data regarding the mortality risk of SIAD specifically are conflicting, with some studies showing increased mortality and some potentially showing reduced mortality compared with other causes of hyponatremia. A prospective observational study in Ireland evaluated mortality outcomes in 1323 hyponatremic patients (43.3% with SIAD) compared to matched controls. SIAD was associated with increased mortality compared to normonatremic controls (RR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08–2.8). However mortality risk in SIAD was not as high as for other causes of hyponatremia. Hypervolemic patients had an RR of mortality of 2.9 compared to SIAD, and hypovolemic patients had an RR of 1.6. A recent Swiss retrospective population-based cohort study of 47 176 medical inpatients with hyponatremia (11.9% with SIAD) using propensity-score matching found no significant effect of hyponatremia on mortality as a whole, but sensitivity stratification by non-SIAD and SIAD hyponatremic patients showed opposing results. While non-SIAD hyponatremic patients had a 10% higher risk for in-hospital mortality, SIAD seemed to be associated with reduced mortality — however, 30-day readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay were all increased in SIAD. SIAD is known to be underrecorded in hospital coding, hence the accuracy of SIAD classification in this study may be low. This is particularly relevant when assessing mortality rates, as if a patient dies of an underlying malignancy, anecdotally, the hospital discharge documentation is even less likely to record comorbid SIAD.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^113fEaVG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized children. SIAD refers to euvolemic hyponatremia due to nonphysiologic stimuli for arginine vasopressin production in the absence of renal or endocrine dysfunction. SIAD can be broadly classified as a result of tumors, pulmonary or central nervous system disorders, medications, or other causes such as infection, inflammation, and the postoperative state. The presence of hypouricemia with an elevated fractional excretion of urate can aid in the diagnosis. Treatment options include fluid restriction, intravenous saline solutions, oral sodium supplements, loop diuretics, oral urea, and vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans).

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^113kbLYG]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for overcorrection of sodium following tolvaptan include lower initial serum sodium, presence of cancer, lower body mass index (BMI), lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased GFR, and concurrent use of other treatments for hyponatremia (eg, hypertonic saline, diuretics, FR, demeclocycline). Lower initial sodium is an intuitive risk, especially as the onset of thirst as the serum sodium enters the normal range for those with a higher sodium starting point would be expected to be protective against overcorrection. The increased risk with cancer may arise from increased severity of paraneoplastic SIAD that could arise from higher AVP concentrations that have been correlated with tolvaptan response in one small study, or may relate to cachexia and low BMI. There are no data available to indicate whether copeptin concentrations can predict response to tolvaptan. In patients with a lower BMI, a given volume of water excreted represents a higher proportion of total body water compared to those with higher BMI, there is a higher likelihood of raising serum sodium concentration rapidly, plus the tolvaptan dose would have a lower volume of distribution in those with lower BMI, hence higher serum concentration and greater capacity to counteract AVP. A lower BUN may represent hypotonicity and may correlate with a greater degree of AVP excess. Higher GFR may contribute to overcorrection risk via improved delivery of tolvaptan to its site of action in the collecting duct, and greater renal free water clearance response, compared to those with reduced renal function.

Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and in severe cases led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, in patients taking diuretics, and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Linezolid.

Endocrine effects of RSV bronchiolitis

Antidiuretic hormone

Hyponatraemia (a serum sodium level of less than 136 mmol/l) was found in 33% of infants requiring intensive care with RSV infection; 11% had a serum sodium level of less than 130 mmol/l. In a less selected population of children, including patients with milder disease, only 0.6% of patients had a serum sodium level of less than 130 mmol/l. This phenomenon has prompted investigations into the underlying endocrine causes. The first report on investigations of hyponatraemia associated with RSV infection dealt with four infants admitted to the ward with hyponatraemia and bronchiolitis during an outbreak of RSV. One presented with focal seizures and hyponatraemia and was found to be RSV positive. All four infants had elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels. One had a synacthen test done, which showed normal cortisol release. Further investigations revealed that ADH levels were significantly higher in patients with bronchiolitis than in patients with apnoeas or upper respiratory tract infections with RSV. The highest levels were found in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Increased ADH levels were associated with high arterial partial pressure of CO 2 and hyperinflation on a chest X-ray. There was, however, no association between ADH levels and serum sodium levels in this study. Hyponatraemia and hyponatraemic seizures have in this context been associated with the application of hypotonic fluids at 100 to 150 ml/kg per day.

Stress hormone responses

A prospective study comparing ventilated infants with RSV infection and patients admitted to the ward showed that ventilated patients had higher prolactin and growth hormone levels and significantly lower leptin and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels. Cortisol levels were not different. The leptin and prolactin levels accounted for 57% of the variation in lymphocyte count, which was significantly lower in ventilated patients with RSV infection.

Figure 9.
Identifying a urine sodium threshold for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) vs hypovolemic hyponatremia: urine sodium concentrations (UNa) in a prospective assessment of 58 patients with plasma sodium concentration less than 130 mmol/L, classified according to response to intravenous 0.9% saline rehydration (gold standard assessment of volume status). This study recommended a threshold of UNa greater than 30 mmol/L to differentiate hypovolemia (saline responders) from SIAD (saline nonresponders). Spot UNa in saline responders and nonresponders. All individual values as well as the mean ± 1 SEM are included. Figure reproduced from Chung 1987 with permission.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of UNa include metabolic alkalosis and dietary solute intake. In the setting of metabolic alkalosis, UNa is not a reliable indicator of volume status (due to excretion of bicarbonate with sodium). In such cases, the urine chloride concentration, which is also typically low in hypovolemia, can be used instead. This assessment assumes normal salt and water intake, as low solute intake can lead to a low UNa even in SIAD — which reduces the specificity for diagnosing hypovolemia as a differential.

It is important to note that hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency and diuretics is usually volume responsive and characterized by a high UNa, hence these are important differentials to consider (discussed later). It has been suggested that calculating fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) is another measure that can assist in diagnosing SIAD, potentially useful in patients on diuretics in whom UNa may be less reliable (see Fig. 2). This is because uric acid is excreted in the proximal tubule and hence is not subject to interference from common diuretics. In one study, a raised FE-UA (> 12%) had a 100% positive predictive value for diagnosis of SIAD regardless of recent diuretics. A challenge, however, is that such results may not be obtained at the point of care quickly enough to influence treatment decisions.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^115XRMHU]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone following high dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a case report [^115NKTdW]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a disorder defined by excess release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in increased water retention. The Bartter and Schwartz criteria for diagnosing SIADH includes decreased serum osmolality, less than 275 milliosmole (mOsm), increased urine osmolality, greater than 100 mOsm, euvolemia, increased urine sodium, greater than 20 milliequivalent/L (mEq/L), and no other cause for hyponatremia such as diuretics, hypercortisolemia, thyroid dysfunction. Etiologies of SIADH include malignancy, CNS disorders, especially disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-renal axis, pulmonary diseases, drugs, transient physiologic stressors including pain and infection, and surgical procedures. The resulting hypotonic hyponatremia, leads to intracellular water shift and symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and seizures when severe.

There are few cases of symptomatic hyponatremia due to SIADH following radiation therapy (RT) in the literature. McDonald et al. reported a case after palliative RT for non-small cell lung cancer, hypothesizing that the SIADH was caused by the release of ADH by dying malignant cells. Similar to the case reported here, Slevin et al. described a case of severe hyponatremia and seizures due to SIADH in a 61-year-old prostate cancer patient after a HDR procedure, hypothesizing that the use of general anesthesia and trauma brought on by the procedure were both contributing factors.

Herein, we report a case of symptomatic hyponatremia due to SIADH after prostate HDR brachytherapy.

### From renal salt wasting to SIADH [^116GLayh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common following major head injury and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A 20-year-old man presented with reduced consciousness after head trauma and was found to have a fractured skull base with bilateral frontal contusions. On day 3 of his admission, he developed hyponatraemia with raised urine sodium and osmolality, despite receiving dexamethasone and intravenous fluid therapy. His hyponatraemia worsened after the treatment with fluid restriction and oral salt. He was in negative fluid balance suggesting possible renal salt wasting. A trial of isotonic normal saline resulted in a further fall in serum sodium level. He was subsequently treated for suspected syndrome of inappropriate ADH with a hypertonic (3%) saline infusion. His sodium level and neurological status improved. This case report illustrates the confounding factors that commonly affect clinical decision-making when treating patients with hyponatraemia following head injury. The guidelines for diagnosis and management are discussed.

Regarding the risk of overcorrection, Table 4 shows that primary polydipsia, initial SNa at presentation, and early urine output were significant risk factors on the univariable analysis. In addition, multivariable model 1 and 2 revealed that only the initial SNa at presentation had a statistically significant impact on the incidence of overcorrection with an adjusted OR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.70–0.98; p = 0.037) for every 1 mEq/L increase in the multivariable model 1 after adjustment of all covariates listed in Table 3. Finally, we divided our study patients into the overcorrection and no-overcorrection groups, and compared the patient parameters, information on treatments and outcomes in Table 1, and the trend of SNa in Fig. 2 just for reference.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^112xVMrb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

### Risk of adverse clinical outcomes in hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions: a population-based cohort study [^1173JybT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

We found robust results in almost 5600 SIAD patients, leading to an alternative, more hypothetical explanation that (over-)production of the antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) during acute medical conditions might be an appropriate sign of immediate hormonal response. It is well established that various stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing vasopressin secretion. Thus, hyponatremia may simply be a marker for high levels of a stress hormone to maintain blood pressure and preserve fluid volume, an evolutionary advantage in "flight-or-fight" situations. Therefore, we may postulate that patients showing an adequate high vasopressin response in a "stress" situation have a survival advantage compared to comparably ill patients without such a capability. However, whether the increase in antidiuretic hormones is appropriate or inappropriate warrants further elucidation.

The major strength of this study is its high external validity, which is based on the large nationwide sample comprising nearly 100 000 patients. Within this cohort, weighted analysis allowed for highly accurate estimates at the national level.

Our data must be interpreted in the context of the study design. First, a certain risk of misclassification and underreporting needs to be acknowledged because administrative data were used in our analyses and we were not able to ascertain the diagnoses. Second, in our study population, merely 2.2% of all included hospitalized medical patients were diagnosed with hyponatremia and qualified for propensity-score matching, although current evidence suggests a much higher prevalence among hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, we were able to include more than 47 000 patients into our propensity-score matched analysis of real-world data. This rather strong data basis, in conjunction with the consistency of the observed effects of hyponatremia on clinical outcome measures in this study, indicates a high degree of internal validity and generalizability. Third, the diagnosis of hyponatremia was based on ICD-10 classification in discharge reports and in some of these reports non-SIAD and SIAD causes of hyponatremia were not distinguished. Because we do not have information on clinical symptoms and severity of hyponatremia, we are unable to account for unmeasured and unmeasurable residual confounding (eg, etiology of hyponatremia, thirst perception, volume status, body mass index, smoking status).

In conclusion, there is a relevant health-care burden among hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions. Further studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms on how hyponatremia may differentially modulate clinical outcomes.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^1145RSFN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^114MVSuY]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid Restriction

In patients with SIAD, FR is the first-line therapy currently recommended by EU and US hyponatremia guidelines, though evidence for efficacy is limited. FR has the advantages of being free and readily accessible; however, limitations include patient adherence, accuracy of fluid balance monitoring in real-world conditions, potential competing need for concurrent medications that require coadministration of oral or IV fluid, and potentially poor tolerability with respect to thirst and quality of life. Interestingly, the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in those with chronic SIAD, which may contribute to discomfort with FR — in a study comparing water intake post hypertonic saline infusion in 8 patients with chronic SIAD and 8 healthy controls, onset of thirst occurred at a significantly lower serum osmolality in those with SIAD, 264 vs 285 mOsml/kg H₂O.

### Hyponatremia and brain injury: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1165uxHq]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in neurocritical care patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research into the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW), their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood. This paper reviews the history behind our understanding of hyponatremia in patients with neurologic injury, including the first reports of CSW and SIADH, and current and future challenges to diagnosis and management in this setting. Such challenges include distinguishing CSW, SIADH, and hypovolemic hyponatremia due to a normal pressure natriuresis from the administration of large volumes of fluids, and hyponatremia due to certain medications used in the neurocritical care population. Potential treatments for hyponatremia include mineralocorticoids and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists, but further work is required to validate their usage. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlining hyponatremia in neurocritical care patients remains our biggest obstacle to optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging population.

### Hyponatremia in the postoperative craniofacial pediatric patient population: a connection to cerebral salt wasting syndrome and management of the disorder [^117S4j1F]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia after cranial vault remodeling has been noted in a pediatric patient population. If left untreated, the patients may develop a clinical hypoosmotic condition that can lead to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and eventually, to central nervous system and circulatory compromise. The hyponatremia has traditionally been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH); however, in our patients the treatment has been resuscitation with normal saline as opposed to fluid restriction (the accepted treatment of SIADH), thus placing the diagnosis of SIADH in question. Patients who developed hyponatremia after intracranial injury or surgery were, until recently, grouped together as having SIADH. However, there are diagnosis and treatment differences between SIADH and another distinct but poorly understood disorder that is designated cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSW). CSW is associated with increased urine output and increased urine sodium concentration and volume contraction, and it is frequently seen after a central nervous system trauma. We therefore developed a prospective study to evaluate the cause of the sodium imbalance. Ten consecutive pediatric patients who underwent intracranial surgery for various craniosynostotic disorders were postoperatively monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit for hemodynamic, respiratory, and fluid management. The first four patients were evaluated for electrolyte changes and overall fluid balance to determine the consistency with which these changes occurred. The remaining six patients had daily (including preoperative) measurement of serum electrolytes, urine electrolytes, urine osmolarity, serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH). All patients received normal saline intravenous replacement fluid in the postoperative period. All of the patients developed a transient hyponatremia postoperatively, despite normal saline resuscitation. Serum sodium levels as low as 128 to 133 mEq per liter (normal, 137 to 145 mEq per liter) were documented in the patients. All patients had increased urine outputs through the fourth postoperative day (> 1 cc/kg/h). The six patients who were measured had an increased ANH level, with a peak value as high as 277 pg/ml (normal, 25 to 77 pg/ml). ADH levels were low or normal in all but one patient, who had a marked increase in ADH and ANH. Aldosterone levels were variable. On the basis of these results, all but one patient showed evidence of CSW characterized by increased urine output, normal or increased urine sodium, low serum sodium, and increased ANH levels. The other patient had similar clinical findings consistent with CSW but also had an increase in ADH, thus giving a mixed laboratory picture of SIADH and CSW. The association of CSW to cranial vault remodeling has previously been ignored. This study should prompt reevaluation of the broad grouping of SIADH as the cause of all hyponatremic episodes in our postoperative patient population. An etiologic role has been given to ANH and to other, as yet undiscovered, central nervous system natriuretic factors. All of the patients studied required normal saline resuscitation, a treatment approach that is contrary to the usual management of SIADH. These findings should dictate a change in the postoperative care for these patients. After cranial vault remodeling, patients should prophylactically receive normal saline, rather than a more hypotonic solution, to avoid sodium balance problems.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111LrPaQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A low serum cortisol (eg, morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L [< 5 mcg/dL], depending on the cortisol assay) in patients without recent confounding medication (eg, exogenous glucocorticoids), is usually suggestive of primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. The gold-standard investigation for primary adrenal insufficiency is an ACTH 1–24 stimulation test (also known as the short synacthen test or the cosyntropin stimulation test), in which 250 mcg of corticotropin is administered parenterally, and cortisol levels measured after 30 and 60 minutes. A peak cortisol concentration below the local laboratory cutoff for the assay (eg, stimulated cortisol < 500 nmol/L [< 18 mcg/dL]) is consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency. A random serum cortisol concentration within the lower part of the normal range may be falsely reassuring in patients who are acutely unwell, who would be expected to be mounting a stress response of cortisol secretion. Therefore, a screening cutoff of morning cortisol greater than 300 nmol/L (> 10.9 mcg/dL) to exclude adrenal insufficiency in hyponatremia is recommended by some experts based on prospective data. Depending on the etiology and clinical presentation, a cortisol level greater than 300 nmol/L may still be inappropriate for a patient under physiologic stress, so this threshold does not definitively exclude pathology, although whether more subtle hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis insufficiency causes hyponatremia is not clear. Those with a morning cortisol less than 300 nmol/L (< 10.9 mcg.dL) may proceed to further evaluation with ACTH and a short synacthen test, unless acutely unwell. Empirical stress-dosing with hydrocortisone should be considered in hyponatremic patients with clinical features suspicious for adrenal insufficiency, a history of long-term exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, and those who are hypotensive or otherwise unwell, to avoid delaying potentially life-saving treatment. There is no universal dosing recommendation for glucocorticoid replacement in this circumstance, but in general patients with hemodynamic instability may benefit from higher IV dosing (eg, 100 mg hydrocortisone stat, then 50 mg IV every 6 hours), with care to monitor for overcorrection of serum sodium. Water diuresis following initiation of glucocorticoid therapy is supportive of adrenal insufficiency as the underlying cause of hyponatremia. Consequently, there is a high risk of serum sodium overcorrection, and requirement for relowering therapy if correction targets are exceeded (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). When correcting secondary adrenal insufficiency in patients with pituitary disease, it is important to be aware of the possibility of unmasking underlying AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) concealed by the stimulation of residual AVP production by cortisol deficiency — which can exacerbate overcorrection risk further.
