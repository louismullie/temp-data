## Question

What should be the approach to young adult patients with exercise-induced PVCs and reported palpitations and lightheadedness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the approach to a young adult with exercise-induced premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) causing palpitations and lightheadedness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment, red flags, and triage. Then, I should verify the core diagnostic workup, including ECG, ambulatory monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise testing. Next, I will examine risk stratification thresholds and imaging escalation. After that, I need to consider key differentials, especially CPVT and other inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Then, I will outline management strategies, including lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and ablation. Finally, I should review return-to-exercise decisions, family screening, and long-term follow-up with an eye toward PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and patient preference [^112kqMNu] [^1126s47S] [^1147qtJj] [^113zYsFi].

> Let me first confirm the essentials from the history and physical exam that shape triage and testing: symptom characterization (palpitations, presyncope/lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain), timing relative to exertion, prodrome, and triggers; personal and family history of cardiac disease, sudden death, drowning, seizures; and a medication/supplement review including stimulants, QT-prolonging agents, and anabolic steroids, plus vitals, murmurs, JVP, edema, and a focused neurologic exam for vasovagal features; any exertional syncope, chest pain, hemodynamic instability, or high-risk family history warrants expedited cardiology evaluation and restriction from intense exercise until cleared, and I should double-check that the patient's exercise context is captured precisely to guide provocative testing later [^116EQeVd] [^112Ez9Pq] [^113uN7nv].

> Next, I should review the core diagnostic tests, starting with a 12-lead ECG to screen for ischemia, conduction disease, pre-excitation, long or short QT, Brugada-type patterns, and to characterize PVC morphology; hold on, let me verify the rhythm–symptom correlation next with ambulatory ECG because a 24–48 hour Holter is reasonable for daily symptoms, while patch/event monitors for up to 2 weeks improve yield for sporadic symptoms and are more cost-effective than frequent short Holters; I need to ensure we quantify PVC burden and look for NSVT, couplets, and morphology clustering [^1118sHiU] [^1165YDsE] [^114a8ivw].

> I will now examine structural assessment with transthoracic echocardiography in essentially all symptomatic young adults with PVCs to exclude cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, congenital anomalies, and to establish baseline ventricular function; wait, I should confirm that if echo is normal but the clinical picture remains concerning (complex ectopy, high burden, or exertional symptoms), cardiac MRI is the next step to detect subtle scar, ARVC, or infiltrative disease, particularly when ectopy is RV outflow or multiform [^113zYsFi] [^111qvVwM].

> Exercise testing is pivotal here; let me think about how to tailor it to reproduce the patient's sport and symptoms, because exercise-provoked PVCs carry different prognostic signals than rest-only ectopy, and recovery-phase ectopy may be a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes; I should confirm that the lab is equipped for resuscitation, and if standard Bruce is non-diagnostic, consider customized protocols mimicking the patient's activity to increase diagnostic yield; if polymorphic or bidirectional ectopy appears with rising heart rate, I need to consider CPVT urgently [^116LvUa1] [^113SjqcF] [^111XcgXD] [^112om26Y].

> Now, risk stratification: I should double-check PVC burden thresholds because a burden around or above 10–15% raises concern for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, with ESC suggesting suspicion at ≥ 10% and many North American sources using > 15% as a practical threshold; additional risk features include complex PVCs (couplets, NSVT), increasing morphologies, broader QRS, non-outflow tract origins, and exercise-induced ectopy; if the burden is high or the morphology suggests a substrate, I need to escalate to CMR and consider EP referral [^112YDC6e] [^114Fh4cp] [^115mVucD].

> But wait, what if the ectopy is exercise-induced and polymorphic or bidirectional? I should confirm the possibility of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, which presents with structurally normal hearts, normal resting ECG, and adrenergically triggered bidirectional or polymorphic VT; diagnosis relies on exercise or catecholamine provocation, and management centers on high-dose beta-blockade (often nadolol), strict exercise restriction, and consideration of flecainide or an ICD in refractory cases; I need to ensure family screening is initiated because CPVT is heritable [^112om26Y] [^112Z7VKa] [^115SNnJo].

> Let me consider other inherited arrhythmia syndromes that can masquerade with exertional symptoms: long QT and Brugada typically manifest at rest or with fever/vagal stimuli, but overlap exists; if the resting ECG is suspicious or family history is concerning, I should verify with repeated ECGs, exercise testing, and, when indicated, genetic testing; in young patients with unexplained exertional syncope or SCA, guidelines support evaluation for genetic arrhythmia syndromes even without overt structural disease [^111bczPf] [^112EowDF].

> Turning to management, I need to ensure lifestyle measures are addressed first: optimize hydration and electrolytes, avoid stimulants and QT-prolonging drugs, moderate caffeine/alcohol, and counsel on anxiety's role in symptom amplification; hold on, I should verify that symptom–PVC correlation is real before escalating therapy, because palpitations often do not track with PVCs in a substantial proportion of patients, which can change the treatment focus toward nonarrhythmic contributors [^114nausy] [^113Z111g].

> For pharmacotherapy in idiopathic PVCs with normal ventricular function, I should confirm that beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable first-line agents to reduce symptoms and ectopy burden; if these are ineffective or not tolerated, flecainide is an option in carefully selected patients with structurally normal hearts, acknowledging proarrhythmic risk and the need for close monitoring; in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, beta-blockers or amiodarone can improve symptoms and LV function, but I need to balance long-term toxicity with efficacy [^112WSM2h] [^113d2K4T] [^114Go1J9].

> For catheter ablation, I should double-check indications: symptomatic patients despite medical therapy, high burden PVCs (generally > 10–15%), or PVC-induced cardiomyopathy with falling LVEF are appropriate candidates, especially when ectopy is monomorphic and mappable; success rates are high for outflow tract and fascicular PVCs, and LV function often normalizes within months after successful suppression; patient preference and local expertise should guide the sequence of meds versus ablation [^112EyLmH] [^11491S1z] [^114Fh4cp] [^113zYsFi].

> Return-to-exercise decisions hinge on whether structural heart disease is present; if echo and CMR are normal and ectopy is low burden and monomorphic without concerning features, unrestricted participation is generally acceptable with symptom-guided thresholds; if complex ectopy or high burden persists, I should reconsider detraining and repeat imaging, and if ARVC or other cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, high-intensity competition should be avoided; in confirmed CPVT, strenuous exercise must be avoided long term; I should confirm shared decision-making with the patient and sports medicine team [^112kqMNu] [^113uN7nv] [^115SNnJo].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal surveillance and family screening are in place: repeat echocardiography at 6–12 months if PVC burden is elevated to detect early PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and extend ambulatory monitoring periodically to track burden; if an inherited arrhythmia syndrome is suspected or diagnosed, cascade screening of first-degree relatives with ECG, exercise testing, and, when appropriate, genetic testing is recommended; throughout, I should keep verifying that our plan aligns with evolving symptoms, patient goals, and guideline-directed care [^1126s47S] [^1147qtJj] [^114a8ivw].

In young adults with exercise-induced PVCs and palpitations/lightheadedness, start with a **focused history, exam, and 12-lead ECG** to screen for structural or electrical disease and red flags (syncope, chest pain, family history of SCD) [^1118sHiU] [^115XuSq8]. If the ECG is abnormal or symptoms are concerning, obtain **echocardiography and ambulatory ECG** to assess burden and morphology, and use exercise testing to provoke and characterize the arrhythmia [^1165YDsE] [^116chErs]. Most with normal hearts and low PVC burden can be reassured and managed conservatively; treat symptoms with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine CCBs if needed [^112WSM2h]. Refer to electrophysiology for high burden (> 10–15%), PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, or refractory symptoms, and consider ablation for persistent, symptomatic, or high-burden PVCs [^112EyLmH] [^11491S1z]. Restrict intense exercise only if structural disease or high-risk features are present [^112kqMNu].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History and physical examination

During the history, **characterize symptoms** — onset, duration, frequency, triggers, and associated features (syncope, chest pain, dyspnea) — and review family history for SCD, cardiomyopathy, or channelopathies. Assess for stimulant use (caffeine, nicotine, energy drinks, supplements), and document medications, including those that prolong the QT interval [^113PQGWa]. On examination, measure vital signs and assess for murmurs, gallops, and signs of heart failure, and screen for neurologic deficits.

---

### Initial diagnostic testing

Obtain a **12-lead ECG** to assess rhythm, conduction, ischemia, and structural clues, and order **routine labs** (CBC, electrolytes, renal and thyroid function) to identify reversible contributors [^1118sHiU].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk stratification **guides further testing and management**:

| **Risk factor** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Syncope or presyncope | Increased risk of malignant arrhythmias; urgent evaluation required [^112Ez9Pq] |
| Family history of SCD | Suspect inherited arrhythmia syndromes (e.g. CPVT, LQTS) [^113PQGWa] |
| High PVC burden (> 10–15%) | Risk of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy [^114Fh4cp] |
| Structural heart disease | Increased risk of malignant arrhythmias; restrict exercise until cleared [^1113K8iv] |

---

## Further diagnostic evaluation

### Ambulatory ECG monitoring

Use **Holter or patch monitoring** to quantify PVC burden, morphology, and correlate with symptoms [^114a8ivw]; for infrequent symptoms, **event monitors** are preferred [^1118sHiU].

---

### Echocardiography

Use **transthoracic echocardiography** to assess ventricular function, wall motion, and valves; if the echo is abnormal or the ectopy is complex, **cardiac MRI** can detect subtle cardiomyopathy or scar [^111qvVwM].

---

### Exercise stress testing

Use **standard exercise testing** to provoke PVCs, assess hemodynamics, and identify ischemia or catecholaminergic arrhythmias; if standard testing is inconclusive, **customized protocols** can reproduce sport-specific symptoms and increase diagnostic yield [^116chErs] [^111XcgXD].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management includes **lifestyle measures** — avoiding triggers, moderating caffeine and alcohol, maintaining hydration, and managing anxiety — and **reassurance** when the heart is normal and the PVC burden is low [^113zYsFi].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line for symptomatic PVCs in normal hearts; reduce adrenergic drive and symptoms [^112WSM2h].

- **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**: Alternative if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective [^113d2K4T].

- **Antiarrhythmic drugs**: Consider flecainide or propafenone for refractory cases with normal hearts; monitor closely for proarrhythmia [^113d2K4T].

---

### Interventional therapy

Interventional therapy includes **catheter ablation** for high burden (> 10–15%), PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, or refractory symptoms; success is high in idiopathic PVCs, particularly from the RVOT or fascicles [^112EyLmH] [^11491S1z].

---

## Exercise restrictions and return-to-play guidelines

- **Normal heart, low burden**: No restriction; return to full activity [^112kqMNu].

- **Structural disease or high-risk features**: Restrict intense exercise until evaluation and treatment are complete [^113uN7nv].

- **Post-ablation**: Gradual return after confirmation of suppression and symptom resolution.

---

## Follow-up and long-term management

Follow-up should include **periodic reassessment** with ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring to detect evolving disease, and **patient education** on symptoms, triggers, and when to seek care [^1126s47S].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include evaluating for **CPVT** with exercise testing and genetic testing when exercise triggers polymorphic ectopy, and screening first-degree relatives for inherited arrhythmias when a genetic syndrome is suspected [^112om26Y] [^112gbiJs].

---

Most young adults with exercise-induced PVCs have a benign course; **thorough evaluation and risk stratification** enable safe return to activity, with therapy tailored to symptoms, burden, and heart health.

### Evaluation and management of premature ventricular complexes [^113zYsFi]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are extremely common, found in the majority of individuals undergoing long-term ambulatory monitoring. Increasing age, a taller height, a higher blood pressure, a history of heart disease, performance of less physical activity, and smoking each predict a greater PVC frequency. Although the fundamental causes of PVCs remain largely unknown, potential mechanisms for any given PVC include triggered activity, automaticity, and reentry. PVCs are commonly asymptomatic but can also result in palpitations, dyspnea, presyncope, and fatigue. The history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are each critical to the diagnosis and evaluation of a PVC. An echocardiogram is indicated in the presence of symptoms or particularly frequent PVCs, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when the evaluation suggests the presence of associated structural heart disease. Ambulatory monitoring is required to assess PVC frequency. The prognosis of those with PVCs is variable, with ongoing uncertainty regarding the most informative predictors of adverse outcomes. An increased PVC frequency may be a risk factor for heart failure and death, and the resolution of systolic dysfunction after successful catheter ablation of PVCs demonstrates that a causal relationship can be present. Patients with no or mild symptoms, a low PVC burden, and normal ventricular function may be best served with simple reassurance. Either medical treatment or catheter ablation are considered first-line therapies in most patients with PVCs associated with symptoms or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and patient preference plays a role in determining which to try first. If medical treatment is selected, either β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable drugs in patients with normal ventricular systolic function. Other antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered if those initial drugs fail and ablation has been declined, has been unsuccessful, or has been deemed inappropriate. Catheter ablation is the most efficacious approach to eradicate PVCs but may confer increased upfront risks. Original research remains necessary to identify individuals at risk for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and to identify preventative and therapeutic approaches targeting the root causes of PVCs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk.

### Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs): a narrative review [^115X2Kgw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs) are relatively common, occurring in 3%-20% of the general population, and are often found during work-up of palpitations or incidentally on routine electrocardiographic testing. They are usually considered benign but can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease and cause significantly impairing symptoms. While often thought of as a problem for the cardiologist, it is not uncommon for PVCs to be identified initially in a primary care or inpatient general medicine setting. This paper will review etiologies, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of PVCs for the internist.

There is a growing body of literature focusing on the morphology, management, and outcomes of PVCs in athletes. This review summarizes this literature and establishes recommendations on management, treatment, and indications for specialist referral in this patient population. The sports medicine physician's responses and recommendation should be made in conjunction with the athletes wishes. Medications or ablations are not always necessary in all athletes if they are followed with regular evaluations.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy — cascade cardiac investigations and arrhythmia provocation: Exercise stress testing (arrhythmia provocation) may be considered as a useful adjunct to cardiovascular evaluation, and in addition, exercise stress testing may expose a latent phenotype by initiating ventricular ectopy or arrhythmia; symptoms such as syncope or palpitations should initiate an urgent evaluation.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions — evaluation for high ectopic burden begins at PVC ≥ 500/24h and instructs clinicians to exclude electrical, ischemic or structural underlying etiology through three axes: imaging work-up (Echocardiography, Cardiac MRI, Other), electrical work-up (Exercise ECG, Signal-averaged ECG, Morphological PVC assessment [unifocal/multifocal; site of origin], Invasive EP study), and genetic work-up (Consider based on familial history, imaging or electrical work-up). Decision nodes then ask Evidence for underlying etiology? with Treatment to improve prognosis if present; otherwise assess Symptomatic PVC? with Treatment to improve symptoms if present. Additional prompts include > 10% PVC burden? followed by Yearly: LV function? and Long-term: CV disease?.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — exercise, athlete context, and high-burden effects are outlined as follows: PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and in 1 study, PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. In trained athletes with palpitations, PVCs are common and there does not appear to be increased risk of death at least in those without other cardiovascular abnormalities, and an electrophysiological study may be needed to assess patients' arrhythmogenic risk. Very frequent PVCs, > 1000 to 20000 a day, can be associated with depressed LV function that is reversible with control of the PVCs (PVC-induced cardiomyopathy). Very rarely, idiopathic PVCs from the outflow tract may trigger malignant VA in patients without structural heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia classification by clinical presentation — definitions used include: Asymptomatic defined as "The absence of symptoms that could result from an arrhythmia". Minimal symptoms/palpitations are patient-reported palpitations in the chest, throat, or neck with sensations such as "Heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing", "An unpleasant awareness of heartbeat", or "Feeling skipped beats or a pause". Presyncope is reported with symptoms including dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or "Graying out". Syncope is "Sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, not related to anesthesia, with spontaneous recovery as reported by the patient or observer", and patients "may experience syncope when supine". Sudden cardiac death is "Death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms", whereas sudden cardiac arrest is the same presentation "in whom medical intervention (e.g., defibrillation) reverses the event".

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Exercise testing and athletic populations — premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during exercise or recovery and the athletic context carry distinct prognostic signals. PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and in 1 study PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. In trained athletes with palpitations, there does not appear to be increased risk of death based on studies of small numbers of athletes, at least in those without other cardiovascular abnormalities. Complex PVCs may not represent a benign finding in endurance athletes and an electrophysiological study may be needed to assess patients' arrhythmogenic risk. Very frequent PVCs, > 10 000 to 20 000 a day, can be associated with depressed LV.

### Palpitations: evaluation in the primary care setting [^115XuSq8]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem in the ambulatory primary care setting, and cardiac causes are the most concerning etiology. Psychiatric illness, adverse effects of prescription and over-the-counter medications, and substance use should also be considered. Distinguishing cardiac from noncardiac causes is important because of the risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. A thorough history and physical examination, followed by targeted diagnostic testing, can distinguish cardiac conditions from other causes of palpitations. Persons with a history of cardiovascular disease, palpitations at work, or palpitations that affect sleep have an increased risk of a cardiac cause. A history of cardiac symptoms, a family history concerning for cardiac dysrhythmias, or abnormal physical examination or electrocardiography findings should prompt a more in-depth evaluation for heart disease. Ischemic symptoms may signal coronary heart disease and associated ventricular premature contractions that may warrant exercise stress testing. Exertional symptoms accompanied by elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, or lower extremity edema should raise concern for heart failure; imaging may be required to assess for functional and structural heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful to evaluate whether symptoms, including palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, are caused by ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR). Continuous or intermittent Holter or event recording is helpful in diagnosing suspected arrhythmias and assessing the response to therapy; a 24-hour continuous Holter recording is appropriate when symptoms occur at least once a day or when quantitation of PVCs/NSVT is desired. Adhesive patch monitors can record for weeks and allow continuous short-term 1-lead monitoring, and serial evaluations with exercise testing and/or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring are also used to assess rhythm burden. When suspicion of VA is high, outpatient ambulatory monitoring is inappropriate as prompt diagnosis and prevention of VA are warranted, and symptoms should be accurately correlated with arrhythmias detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to management of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation in patients requiring arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining ventricular function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular complexes (generally > 15% of beats and predominately of 1 morphology) and if antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to management of premature ventricular complexes, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating β-blockers or nondihydropyridine CCB to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms in patients with symptomatic premature ventricular complexes in an otherwise normal heart.

Conclusion

Clinical and ECG presentation of LQTS vary between the paediatric/young and adult LQTS population. Risk stratification and management strategies against young patients should take into consideration the difference between paediatric and adult patients and adopt an individualised approach.

Important considerations in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected ventricular arrhythmias (VA) list assessment findings relevant for VA and/or sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, including history of symptoms/events related to arrhythmia (palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, cardiac arrest), symptoms related to underlying heart disease (dyspnea at rest or on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, edema), precipitating factors (exercise, emotional stress), known heart disease (coronary, valvular [eg, mitral valve prolapse], congenital heart disease, other), risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking), medications (antiarrhythmic medications; other medications with potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; medications with potential to provoke or aggravate VA; stimulants including cocaine and amphetamines; supplements including anabolic steroids; medication–medication interaction that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes), past medical history (thyroid disease; acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or electrolyte abnormalities; stroke or embolic events; lung disease; epilepsy; alcohol or illicit drug use; use of over-the-counter medications that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; unexplained motor vehicle crashes), and family history (SCD, SCA, or unexplained drowning in a first-degree relative; SIDS or repetitive spontaneous pregnancy losses; heart disease [IHD; cardiomyopathy — hypertrophic, dilated, ARVC; congenital heart disease; cardiac channelopathies — Long QT, Brugada, Short QT, CPVT; arrhythmias; conduction disorders, pacemakers/ICDs]; neuromuscular disease associated with cardiomyopathies including muscular dystrophy; and epilepsy).

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^1116ztZD]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) requires a high degree of clinical suspicion with testing, and the clinical presentation and diagnosis of the genetically determined causes (eg, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [ARVC], lamin A/C, filamin-C, desmin) of ACM prior to puberty is uncommon. Clinical perspectives of ACM arise primarily from patients with arrhythmias of right ventricular (RV) origin and sudden cardiac death (SCD), and in the subset with ARVC, individual clinical and diagnostic findings are individually neither highly specific nor sensitive, and diagnostic criteria have been established to standardize the diagnosis. The diagnosis of ARVC should be considered in patients with exercise-related palpitations and/or syncope; survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (particularly during exercise); and individuals with frequent ventricular premature beats (> 500 in 24 hours) and/or VT of LBBB morphology in the absence of other heart disease. In patients with suspected ACM who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the evaluation should be systematic to establish the diagnosis of other genetic and nongenetic forms of ACM, with repeated evaluations considered if the disease is strongly suspected.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^1157wwVT]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope in paediatric patients — diagnosis, risk features, and management note that reflex syncope represents the vast majority of the aetiology, and in patients with a typical history of reflex syncope, normal physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) are usually sufficient to cease investigation. Tilt testing seems to have high false-negative and false-positive rates and should be used with caution for primary identification of patients with reflex syncope; a remarkably high incidence of near-fainting (40%) was reported during tilt testing after placement of a simple intravenous line in healthy children and teenagers, and in one study a shorter tilt test duration of 10 min at 60 or 70° showed a specificity > 85%. History features that should prompt cardiac evaluation include family history of premature SCD < 30 years or familial heart disease, known or suspected heart disease, syncope during exercise, syncope without prodrome, and syncope with chest pain or palpitations. For therapy, the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and tilt training for recurrent syncope is undetermined in the absence of well-designed paediatric trials, pacemakers should be avoided even in VVS with prolonged asystole due to the relatively transient and benign nature of the syndrome, and the cornerstone of therapy for young patients with reflex syncope includes education and reassurance.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC ventricular arrhythmia management — exercise testing provides graded indications, prognostic information, and safety notes: Exercise testing is recommended in adult patients with ventricular arrhythmias who have an intermediate or greater probability of having CHD by age, gender, and symptoms* to provoke ischemic changes or ventricular arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: B). Exercise testing, regardless of age, is useful in patients with known or suspected exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic VT, to provoke the arrhythmia, achieve a diagnosis, and determine the patient's response to tachycardia (Level of Evidence: B). Exercise testing can be useful in evaluating response to medical or ablation therapy in patients with known exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: B). Exercise testing may be useful in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and a low probability of CHD by age, gender, and symptoms* (Level of Evidence: C), and Exercise testing may be useful in the investigation of isolated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in middle-aged or older patients without other evidence of CHD (Level of Evidence: C). See Table 1 in the ACC/AHA 2002 Guideline Update for Exercise Testing for contraindications (Level of Evidence: B). The presence of exercise-induced ventricular ectopy increases mortality at 12 mo by 3-fold relative to patients with ectopy at rest only, and in one series, exercise testing in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias was associated with a 2.3% incidence of arrhythmias requiring cardioversion, intravenous drugs, or resuscitation. Exercise testing should be performed where resuscitation equipment and trained personnel are immediately available.

Ambulatory electrocardiography — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful to evaluate whether symptoms, including palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, are caused by ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Class I, B-NR). A 24-hour continuous Holter recording is appropriate when symptoms occur at least once a day or when quantitation of PVCs/nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is desired, whereas event or "looping" monitors are more appropriate for sporadic symptoms. Adhesive patch monitors can record for weeks and allow continuous short-term 1-lead monitoring with patient activation; serial evaluations with exercise testing and/or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring are also used to assess rhythm burden and response of VA to therapy. When suspicion of VA is high, outpatient ambulatory monitoring is inappropriate, and it is important to accurately correlate symptoms with arrhythmias detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) evaluation — history, family history, medication review, and examination elements are detailed, including arrhythmia symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, cardiac arrest) and symptoms of underlying heart disease (dyspnea at rest or on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, edema), precipitating factors (exercise, emotional stress), known heart disease (coronary, valvular such as mitral valve prolapse, congenital), and risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking). Medication review encompasses antiarrhythmic and other medications with potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, medications with potential to provoke or aggravate VA, stimulants including cocaine and amphetamines, supplements including anabolic steroids, and medication‑medication interactions that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Family history elements include SCD, SCA, or unexplained drowning in a first-degree relative; SIDS or repetitive spontaneous pregnancy losses; and heart disease with inherited conditions such as cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, dilated, ARVC), congenital heart disease, cardiac channelopathies (Long QT, Brugada, Short QT, CPVT), arrhythmias, and conduction disorders or devices. Physical examination focuses on heart rate and regularity, blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, murmurs, pulses and bruits, edema, and sternotomy scars. The text also notes that obtaining a complete medication history is important, that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and that some medications can also induce Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF.

Brugada syndrome — clinical manifestations and typical presentation: Symptoms associated with BrS include ventricular fibrillation (VF) or aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), syncope, nocturnal agonal respiration, palpitations, and chest discomfort. These symptoms often occur during rest or sleep, during a febrile state or with vagotonic conditions, but rarely during exercise. The syndrome typically manifests during adulthood, with a mean age of sudden death of 41 ± 15 years, and BrS is associated with no clearly apparent structural heart diseases, although mild right and left ventricular structural abnormalities have been reported.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — patients with symptomatic or ventricular function decline suspected from frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and for whom antiarrhythmic drugs are not effective, not tolerated, or not preferred may undergo catheter ablation, and in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy pharmacologic therapy is reasonable. For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining ventricular function suspected to be due to frequent PVCs (generally > 15% of beats and predominately of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacologic treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, and improve symptoms and left ventricular (LV) function.

5 CONCLUSION

A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of patients with frequent PVCs. Therefore, when making treatment decisions, it's important to carefully investigate the correlation between symptoms and arrhythmias. PVCs with a relatively short PVC CI and a long post‐PVC CI were more likely to cause palpitations, whereas palpitations lasting only a few seconds were more likely to be directly relevant to PVCs.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — exercise association and cardiomyopathy risk are described as follows: PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. Very frequent PVCs, > 1000 to 20000 a day, can be associated with depressed left ventricular (LV) function in some patients that is reversible with control of the PVCs and has been referred to as PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and very rarely idiopathic PVCs from the outflow tract may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — factors pointing to worse prognosis: Factors that may point to worse prognosis in patients with PVCs include underlying structural, ischemic or electrical disease; more than 2000 PVC/24 h; complex PVCs (couplets, triplets, and non-sustained VT); increasing number of morphologies; increasing number PVCs with exercise; non-outflow tract PVC (usually monomorphic or only slightly divergent morphologies); short coupling interval of the PVCs (R-on-T); and PVCs with broader QRS complexes (more frequently related to cardiomyopathy). These factors may suggest a poorer prognosis and need a thorough investigation to rule out underlying structural, ischemic, or electrical disease, with additional evaluations individually tailored.

Premature ventricular complexes — evaluation considerations: Because some studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes, the detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and such patients are generally evaluated to ensure they do not have underlying conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) that warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### The teenager with palpitations [^115fsqra]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Palpitations can result from cardiac awareness (increased conscious perception of the heart beating) or from a fast or irregular cardiac rhythm. Most causes for palpitations in the teenager can be diagnosed with minimal testing. Patients with an abnormal ECG, non-sinus tachycardia, abnormal cardiac examination, concerning family history, or palpitations associated with activity or syncope should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist. This article discusses the evaluation, testing, and management of teenagers with palpitations. It also provides a general guideline for referral for subspecialty evaluation.

### MEPPC syndrome: a systematic review and state-of-the-art paper [^114FKky7]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions syndrome presents as a rare cardiac disorder characterized by frequent multifocal ectopic ventricular beats with narrow QRS complexes, originating from various ectopic foci along the fascicular-Purkinje system. It is characterized by mutations in the SCN5A gene, inducing a gain-of-function in the human cardiac voltage-gated Na + channel (Na v 1.5), which causes an alteration in the action potentials of the cardiomyocytes. The syndrome was initially delineated in 2012 by Laurent et al in 3 Dutch families, subsequently garnering recognition through several reported cases worldwide. Clinically, it often manifests with a familial predisposition to other arrhythmogenic cardiac diseases, alongside symptoms such as palpitations and syncope. A key diagnostic hallmark is the high daily burden of multifocal premature ventricular contractions observed on 24-hour dynamic ECG, with evidence of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias. This can potentially induce a reversible form of left ventricular dilation with systolic dysfunction, known as premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis may be challenging, requiring exclusion of the most frequent causes of ventricular arrhythmias first. The disappearance of arrhythmias during a stress test and the inefficacy of catheter ablation procedures may serve as additional elements to bolster the suspicion of multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions syndrome. Genetic testing and electrophysiological studies are pivotal in confirming the diagnosis. Therapeutic management of this syndrome primarily involves medical therapy with class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as flecainide and quinidine, which may reduce ventricular arrhythmias and associated symptoms. In this systematic review, our aim was to provide an exhaustive insight into the genetic basis, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for this intriguing yet relatively underexplored syndrome.

### Evaluation and management of arrhythmia in the athletic patient [^117NF1B7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Athletes may present with palpitations, syncope, or arrest resulting in the diagnosis of arrhythmia, or screening may result in diagnosis of conditions with predisposition to arrhythmia. This chapter focuses on 3 common arrhythmic conditions in athletes-atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and the athlete with an implanted device. (1) Atrial fibrillation: most studies show that atrial fibrillation is more common in competitive athletes, particularly those participating in long-term endurance sports. Postulated mechanisms include morphologic changes such as atrial dilatation, autonomic changes such as increased vagal tone, or inflammatory changes due to sports participation. Treatment options include long-term antiarrhythmic agents, "pill in the pocket" medications, or radiofrequency ablation, a highly successful procedure in athletes. (2) Premature ventricular contractions: data conflict on whether the incidence of PVCs is increased in highly trained individuals. Very frequent PVCs in athletes, however, can be a manifestation of underlying heart disease, and athletes presenting with PVCs should undergo evaluation. In the absence of underlying heart disease, PVCs do not carry a poor prognosis, and US guidelines do not recommend restriction from sports. (3) Implanted devices: the safety of sports for the athlete with an implanted device is unknown, and current guidelines recommend against participation in vigorous competitive sports, based on postulated risks including failure to defibrillate and risk of injury. Many athletes with defibrillators and pacemakers do participate in sports. Ongoing research will better delineate the risks of sports for the athlete with an implanted device.

Orthostatic intolerance — definition and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) features are described as frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, most commonly including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. One condition of note is POTS, in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS. Treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 ventricular arrhythmias — symptoms and hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia note that palpitations or a perception of cardiac rhythm irregularity may be caused by the whole spectrum of arrhythmias and can also occur without arrhythmia; patients with ventricular tachycardia may present with paroxysmal dyspnea or chest pain related to hemodynamic consequences; presyncope is a vague term, poorly defined and not specific, and ventricular tachycardia may cause undiagnosed syncope especially with structural heart disease; patients with poor ventricular function and inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation have a high incidence of subsequent appropriate therapies when implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and similar patients may be at risk of sudden cardiac death; very rapid ventricular tachycardia such as torsades de pointes with repolarization syndromes will typically present with syncope or seizure rather than palpitations; in hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, patients may be asymptomatic but more often sense rapid heart beating with dyspnea or chest discomfort, stability relates to tachycardia rate, retrograde conduction, ventricular function and peripheral compensatory mechanisms, stable presentations do not suggest absence of heart disease and can occur with very poor left ventricular function, and even patients with poor ventricular function may not notice palpitations during ventricular tachycardia.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114o7hxP]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Suspected tachycardia — EPS findings and prognostic value: In patients with syncope preceded by sudden-onset brief palpitations suggesting supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), an EPS may be indicated to assess the exact mechanism especially when a curative catheter ablation procedure can be performed. In patients with previous myocardial infarction and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is strongly predictive of the cause of syncope, whereas induction of ventricular fibrillation is considered a non-specific finding; absence of inducible ventricular arrhythmias identifies a lower-risk group. The role of EPS with pharmacological challenge by class I antiarrhythmic drugs in syncope with suspected Brugada syndrome is controversial. A meta-analysis of world-wide data reported 1036 patients, in 54% of whom VT or ventricular fibrillation had been induced by premature ventricular stimulation, with no difference in outcome observed in 34 months follow-up.

### Outpatient approach to palpitations [^114D8G6o]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem seen in family medicine; most are of cardiac origin, although an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety, is also common. Even if a psychiatric comorbidity does exist, it should not be assumed that palpitations are of a noncardiac etiology. Discerning cardiac from noncardiac causes is important given the potential risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. History and physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing are necessary to distinguish a cardiac cause from other causes of palpitations. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an essential initial diagnostic test. Cardiac imaging is recommended if history, physical examination, or electrocardiography suggests structural heart disease. An intermittent event (loop) monitor is preferred for documenting cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when they occur infrequently. Ventricular and atrial premature contractions are common cardiac causes of palpitations; prognostic significance is dictated by the extent of underlying structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia resulting in hospitalization; such patients are at increased risk of stroke. Patients with supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) diagnosis — expert consensus criteria include age-stratified exercise/catecholamine-induced arrhythmias and genetic/family findings. CPVT is diagnosed in the presence of a structurally normal heart, normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and unexplained exercise or catecholamine-induced bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) or polymorphic ventricular premature beats or VT in an individual < 40 years of age. CPVT is diagnosed in patients (index case or family member) who have a pathogenic mutation, and CPVT is diagnosed in family members of a CPVT index case with a normal heart who manifest exercise-induced premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or bidirectional/ polymorphic VT. CPVT can be diagnosed in the presence of a structurally normal heart and coronary arteries, normal ECG, and unexplained exercise or catecholamine-induced bidirectional VT or polymorphic ventricular premature beats or VT in an individual > 40 years of age.

### The impact of high burden idiopathic premature ventricular contractions in pediatric versus adult populations. A retrospective cohort study [^112v1PE3]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can occur in up to 40% of children with structurally normal hearts. The study aims to assess the impact of high-burden idiopathic PVCs on children in comparison with adults in terms of symptoms, distribution of origin, management strategies, and safety considerations. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study that included patients with frequent PVCs (> 10% burden in Holter monitoring) and categorized by age into adult group (≥ 18 years) and pediatric group. Data encompassed demographic profiles, clinical symptoms, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic analyses, and one-year follow-up management. A total of 224 PVC cases were collected during a 2-year study (120 children and 104 adults). Syncope occurred significantly more in children than adults (15.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.003). In children, the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) free wall was the predominant site (48 patients; 40%), while the septal RVOT was most common in adults (35 patients; 33.7%). Pediatric cases exhibited significantly higher PVCs originating from the outflow tract (92.5% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.001). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between groups regarding the safety, acute, and one-year outcomes of RF ablation. Age disparities were evident in syncope incidence and PVC origin, with no variance in PVC-induced myopathy prevalence or the safety and outcomes of RF catheter ablation between children and adults.

### Management challenges in left ventricular diverticulum: a case with 8-year follow-up and literature review [^113PZTCR]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

This case represents a young, previously healthy woman with intermittent palpitations, who was found to have a left ventricular outpouching. Imaging with echocardiography and magnetic resonance revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with a slightly reduced ejection fraction. The outpouching was characterised as a left ventricular diverticulum (LVD) as it involved all three layers of the heart wall with synergistic contraction. This is an extremely rare, usually incidentally found entity. Management is based on case reports as guideline-based therapies lack with a wide range of treatment options, from watchful waiting to surgical repair, suggesting an unmet clear management strategy. Despite slightly reduced exercise capacity, symptoms and imaging findings remained stable over a period of 8 years with medical therapy and close follow-up. We underscore the importance of adopting a cautious strategy in the management of patients with LVD. The management decision, however, remains patient-tailored, considering the type of anomaly and patient characteristics.

Section 3 Clinical Evaluation

3.1. Clinical Presentation

Recommendation for clinical evaluation of patients with VAs

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

1. History should identify the onset, duration, frequency, and trigger of any symptoms and should include medication use as well as comorbidities and family history. Available cardiac rhythm data include interrogation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to assess arrhythmia burden, morphologies, and duration as well as treatment. Electrogram storage may be programmed to include far- and near-field electrograms to allow superior assessment of VA morphologies. The laboratory workup should be individualized to the patient's presentation and may include electrolytes, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, genetic testing, or drug screening as appropriate.

Synopsis

The clinical presentations of patients with VAs encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to VT/VF storm or sudden cardiac death.

Presenting symptoms can be classified into 5 groups: due to the VA itself (eg, PVCs, VT or VF); due to a secondary disease caused by the VAs (eg, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy); due to an underlying pathology associated with the VAs (eg, ischemia); due to ICD therapy; and a combination of these causes.

Idiopathic VA is frequently asymptomatic, especially when presenting as PVCs or nonsustained VT. In those cases, Vas are commonly detected coincidentally during routine exams. If symptomatic, symptoms can often be secondary to post-PVC augmentation of contractility or a post-PVC compensatory pause, and commonly consist of palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or chest discomfort. With increasing duration or VA rate (eg, VT or VF), hemodynamic compromise can result in more severe symptoms, such as pre-syncope, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death.

Screening of family members — when first-degree relatives of victims of SADS or premature (less than 50 years old) unexplained sudden death undergo cardiac assessment, up to half of families reveal cardiac genetic diseases; the strategy for evaluation is staged with less invasive investigations first and then more invasive tests if a diagnosis is not made. The investigative protocol may include personal and family history and history of the sudden death victim; resting, exercise, signal-averaged and ambulatory 24 hour ECG; echocardiography; and provocation testing with sodium channel blocker and/or epinephrine and cardiac MRI as required. Resting and exercise ECG, Class I drug challenge and cardiac imaging offer the most diagnostic value consistently across studies. It is reasonable that relatives of SUDI deaths who are obligate carriers or have ominous symptoms such as cardiac syncope should be prioritized for evaluation, young family members may require periodic reassessment even if the initial assessment is normal, and repeated evaluations should occur if family members become symptomatic or additional suspicious sudden deaths are identified in the family.

### Predictors and possible mechanisms of premature ventricular contraction induced cardiomyopathy [^116bhuVD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are encountered frequently in clinical practice. While PVCs may have various causes, a small number of individuals with PVCs develop cardiomyopathy in the absence of other potential etiologies. When correctly identified, patients with PVC-incuded cardiomyopathy can have dramatic improvement of their cardiomyopathy with treatment of their PVCs. In this focused review, we discuss potential predictors of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, including PVC frequency, PVC characteristics, and modifiable patient risk factors. We also review some proposed mechanisms of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and conclude with future directions for research and clinical practice.

Introduction

In patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), palpitations may not always be directly caused by PVCs, and therefore, it is essential to establish symptom-rhythm correlations to determine the appropriate treatment. This study aims to analyze the palpitations and related factors in patients with frequent PVCs.

Methods

The study enrolled patients with frequent PVCs who were not combined with other arrhythmias or structural heart disease. Through face-to-face consultation, patients were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. For symptomatic patients, the correlation between palpitations and PVC was further evaluated based on the temporal consistency of symptom onset and PVC occurrence. The demographic, clinical, and electrocardiogram features of the patients in each group were compared.

Results

Of the 214 patients enrolled, 124(57.9%) experienced palpitations. Compared to the asymptomatic group, the symptomatic group had a higher proportion of females (63.7% vs. 47.8%; p = .020) and a higher proportion of subjects with anxiety (44.4% vs.14.4%; p = .000). Within the symptomatic patients, 72 (33.60%) who had palpitations that were clearly correlated with PVCs were classified as the PVC-relevant group. In this group, the PVC CI ratios were significantly lower (55% [52% -60%] vs. 62% [55% -67%]; p = .001) and the Post-PVC CI were longer (1170 [1027–1270] vs. 1083 [960–1180] ms; p = .018) than in the PVC-irrelevant group.

Conclusion

A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of patients with frequent PVCs. PVCs with a relatively short PVC CI and a long post-PVC CI were more likely to cause palpitations, whereas palpitations lasting only a few seconds were more likely to be directly relevant to PVCs.

Background

A 44-year-old female presented with a long history of chest pain, palpitations and increasing dyspnea. Electrocardiography and 24 h Holter monitoring revealed multiple premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), and echocardiography demonstrated significant left ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment. After further investigation it was concluded that this cardiomyopathy was secondary to the observed multiple PVCs and that these represented a potential target for treatment.

Investigations

Electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, 24 h Holter monitoring, coronary angiography, tilt testing and invasive electrophysiological testing using a multielectrode array catheter.

Diagnosis

PVC-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.

Management

Electrophysiological mapping and cryoablation of the focus of the ventricular ectopy.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) management — ventricular premature beats (VPBs) — Asymptomatic VPBs usually persist on Holter recordings and exercise tests with an unmodified threshold of appearance, and complete suppression of asymptomatic VPBs does not seem to be mandatory. The presence of couplets or more successive VPBs during exercise testing seems significantly associated with future arrhythmic events, suggesting intensifying the treatment in these patients.

Athletes — arrhythmias, cardiac devices, and participation guidance: For legal and ethical reasons, athletes receiving cardiovascular drugs and devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are generally not allowed to participate in high-grade competition, and according to the World Anti-Doping Code, beta blockers and diuretics are prohibited in some particular sports. Athletes presenting with syncope or presyncope should not participate in competitive sports until the cause is determined to be both benign and treatable, whereas athletes with nonsustained and asymptomatic exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias may participate in low-intensity competitive sports provided that no structural heart disease has been demonstrated.

Athletes — ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) preparticipation and evaluation: Preparticipation history and physical examination, including family history of premature or SCD and specific evidence of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiomyopathies and ion channel abnormalities, is recommended in athletes (Level of Evidence: C). Athletes presenting with rhythm disorders, structural heart disease, or other signs or symptoms suspicious for cardiovascular disorders should be evaluated as any other patient but with recognition of the potential uniqueness of their activity (Level of Evidence: C). Athletes presenting with syncope should be carefully evaluated to uncover underlying cardiovascular disease or rhythm disorder (Level of Evidence: B). Athletes with serious symptoms should cease competition while cardiovascular abnormalities are being fully evaluated (Level of Evidence: C). Twelve-lead ECG and possibly echocardiography may be considered as preparticipation screening for heart disorders in athletes (Level of Evidence: B).

### A 54-year-old woman with premature ventricular complexes and a rapidly changing ECG [^113VZ8wM]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common findings in asymptomatic participants during ECG recordings. While most PVCs are treated conservatively, some patients may develop adverse cardiac events needing further investigations and definitive ablation by radiofrequency. Spectral strain ultrasonography has demonstrated ventricular dysfunction as a sequel to high burden PVCs, but the exact underlying pathophysiology is still uncertain. Cohort studies have associated PVCs with increased risks for overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and yet consensus is still lacking for threshold in treating PVCs. Our case is that of a 54-year-old woman with an unusual bradycardiac presentation of PVCs and an ECG that changed rapidly within minutes.

### Diagnostic yield of customized exercise provocation following routine testing [^111XcgXD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines advocate for customization of exercise testing to address patient-specific diagnostic goals, including reproduction of presenting exertional symptoms. However, the diagnostic yield of adding customized exercise testing to graded exercise in patients presenting with exertional complaints has not been rigorously examined and is the focus of this study. Using prospectively collected data, we analyzed the diagnostic yield of customized additional exercise provocation following inconclusive graded exercise test with measurement of gas exchange. Additional testing was defined as "positive" if it revealed a clinically-actionable diagnosis related to the chief complaint or reproduced symptoms in the absence of an explanatory diagnosis or pathology. Of 1,110 patients who completed a graded test, 122 (11%) symptomatic patients underwent additional customized exercise testing (e.g., sprint intervals and race simulations). Compared with those who did not undergo additional testing, this group was younger (29 [interquartile range 19 to 45] vs 46 [25 to 58] year old) and disproportionately female (43% vs 27%). Presenting symptoms included palpitations (46%), lightheadedness/syncope (25%), chest pain (14%), dyspnea (11%), and exertional intolerance (3%). Additional testing was "positive" in 48 of 122 (39%) of patients by revealing a clinically actionable diagnosis in 26 of 48 (54%) or reproducing symptoms without an explanatory diagnosis in 22 of 48 (46%). In conclusion, while patient-centered customization of exercise testing is suggested by clinical guidelines, these data are the first to demonstrate that the selective addition of customized exercise provocation following inconclusive graded exercise testing improves the diagnostic yield of exercise assessment.

Implications for competitive sports eligibility

The presence of an underlying heart disease is a key prognostic factor and the most important determinant regarding eligibility recommendations for competitive sports activity for athletes with PVBs.

According to the 2015 recommendations of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, athletes with PVBs or couplets in the absence of structural heart disease should be considered eligible for all competitive sports. The recommended intensity of exercise is to remain under the threshold for the occurrence of arrhythmia-related symptoms such as presyncope, dizziness or dyspnoea. If at-risk cardiovascular disease is identified, only sports activities at low cardiovascular demand are allowed.

The 2006 consensus document of the Working Group on Sports Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology provided more strict criteria for eligibility and recommended to exclude from competitive sports activity athletes with > 2000 PVBs/day and complex or exercise-induced PVBs even in the absence of an underlying structural heart disease, unless they disappear after 3–6 months of detraining. However, these recommendations appear out of date considering more recent scientific data on the morphology and clinical meaning of PVBs.

### Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of exercise-induced arrhythmias [^113mrwyh]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of physical activity are indisputable. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that both atrial fibrillation and right ventricular arrhythmia can be caused by intense exercise in some individuals. Exercise-induced atrial fibrillation is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged, otherwise healthy men who have been engaged in endurance training for > 10 years, and is mediated by atrial dilatation, parasympathetic enhancement, and possibly atrial fibrosis. Cardiac ablation is evolving as a first-line tool for athletes with exercise-induced arrhythmia who are eager to remain active. The relationship between physical activity and right ventricular arrhythmia is complex and involves genetic and physical factors that, in a few athletes, eventually lead to right ventricular dilatation, followed by subsequent myocardial fibrosis and lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction blocks are common in athletes, most of whom remain asymptomatic, although incomplete reversibility has been shown after exercise cessation. In this Review, we summarize the evidence supporting the existence of exercise-induced arrhythmias and discuss the specific considerations for the clinical management of these patients.

### Application of the 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guidelines for risk stratification for sudden death in adult patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^112Ydt8v]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of the asymptomatic pre-excited patient largely hinges on risk stratification and individual patient considerations and choice. A high threshold to treat patients may lead to a small overall risk of death while a low threshold clearly leads to increased invasive testing and ablation with associated cost and procedural risk. A firm recommendation to uniformly assess all by electrophysiology study or, alternatively, reassure all is inappropriate and unjustified by data as reflected in the recent guideline recommendations. The use of noninvasive and invasive parameters to identify the potentially at-risk individual with surveillance for symptoms in those comfortable with this approach or ablation for those choosing this alternative for individual reasons remains the cornerstone of best practice.

Papillary muscle ventricular arrhythmias (VA), including premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) — phenotype, outcomes, and recommendation: The papillary muscles of the left ventricle (LV) or right ventricle (RV) can be the site of origin of VA in the presence or absence of structural heart disease, and idiopathic papillary muscle VA are most commonly PVCs and NSVT, are usually exercise-related, and may be induced by intravenous epinephrine or isoproterenol. In 1 study, successful ablation was achieved in all 8 patients with a reduction in PVC burden from 17 ± 20% to 0.6 ± 0.8%, and in the LV the site of origin may be either the posteromedial or the anterolateral papillary muscles. Multiple VA QRS morphologies were observed in 47% of patients, ablation on both sides of the papillary muscle is required in some patients, acute ablation success is high, and recurrences are more frequent than for idiopathic outflow tract VA. Serious complications, including valve injury, appear to be infrequent, and risks include bleeding related to arterial and venous access and a low risk of pericardial tamponade. For symptomatic papillary muscle VA when antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful (I, B-NR).

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contractions are the most frequent ventricular arrhythmia and commonly associated with HF, ventricular arrhythmias, and SCD. Frequent PVCs are recognized as a reversible cause of LV systolic dysfunction referred to as 'PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy' (PVC-CM), where PVC suppression will improve and even normalize LV function. The prevalence of PVC-CM is estimated between 10 and 29% in patients with frequent PVCs (> 5–10%). While PVC burden is the most consistent predictor of PVC-M, various factors, including genetics, comorbidities, cardiac phenotype, or PVC features and length of exposure, play a role in the susceptibility or resilience to develop PVC-CM. In addition, PVCs with a longer QRS duration and epicardial location are more frequently associated with PVC-CM, supporting the role of LV dyssynchrony in PVC-CM (Table 2 and Figure 1).

Table 2
Clinical and premature ventricular contraction features to identify premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy can present with or without fatigue, HF symptoms, syncope, and SCD. Frequently, patients are referred for bradycardia due to bigeminy where heart rate is underestimated (i.e. pseudo-bradycardia) due to the lack of pulse pressure generated by PVC. The time to develop PVC-CM is unknown, but probably months or years of exposure to frequent PVCs are needed.

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy diagnosis should be suspected if PVC burden is > 5–10% and other causes of HF are excluded, and confirmed only if PVC suppression improves and even normalizes LV function. A major diagnosis challenge is when PVCs cannot be successfully eliminated. A frequent dilemma is to determine whether the PVCs are a bystander or the cause of CM. Some PVCs and clinical features (e.g. absence of scar) can assist to differentiate these two scenarios (Table 2).

### How to evaluate premature ventricular beats in the athlete: critical review and proposal of a diagnostic algorithm [^113Sfdmn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although premature ventricular beats (PVBs) in young people and athletes are usually benign, they may rarely mark underlying heart disease and risk of sudden cardiac death during sport. This review addresses the prevalence, clinical meaning and diagnostic/prognostic assessment of PVBs in the athlete. The article focuses on the characteristics of PVBs, such as the morphological pattern of the ectopic QRS and the response to exercise, which accurately stratify risk. We propose an algorithm to help the sport and exercise physician manage the athlete with PVBs. We also address (1) which athletes need more indepth investigation, including cardiac MRI to exclude an underlying pathological myocardial substrate, and (2) which athletes can remain eligible to competitive sports and who needs to be excluded.

Sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) therapeutic interventions — Genetic screening of the first-degree relatives of a SUDS victim is recommended whenever a pathogenic mutation in a gene associated with increased risk of sudden death is identified by molecular autopsy in the SUDS victim. Evaluation of first-degree blood relatives of all SUDS victims with resting ECG with high right ventricular leads, exercise stress testing and echocardiography is recommended, and assessment of obligate carriers and relatives with a history of palpitations, arrhythmias or syncope should be prioritized. Follow-up clinical assessment is indicated in young family members of SUDS victims who may manifest symptoms and/or signs of the disease at an older age and in all family members whenever additional SUDS or SUDI events occur. Evaluation of first-degree relatives of SUDS victims with ambulatory and signal-averaged ECGs, cardiac MRI and provocative testing with Class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs can be useful, and evaluation of first-degree relatives of SUDS victims with epinephrine infusion may be considered.

### Exercise-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in adults without structural heart disease [^115SZpsB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia present at a young age with exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and may have a positive family history. We describe 8 patients who presented with exercise-induced symptoms as adults, have a negative family history, and responded to beta-blocker therapy. The study evaluated exercise treadmill electrocardiographic data from patients referred for exercise-induced VA. Inclusion criteria consisted of development of bidirectional, pleomorphic, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with exercise, adult age at first onset, negative family history, and no evidence of structural heart disease. We correlated VA configurations with respect to heart rate before and after beta-blocker therapy. Patients displayed a pattern of increasing ventricular complexity with increasing heart rate. The appropriate beta blocker (n = 7) or calcium channel blocker (n = 1) was defined as the dose that resulted in control of symptoms. Three patients showed suppression of VA with sinus tachycardia at peak heart rate. Six patients had decreased VA defined as absence of higher complexity arrhythmias. With drug therapy, average heart rate associated with premature ventricular complex couplets/triplets increased, whereas duration and complexity of premature ventricular complexes decreased. One patient had an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placed but has had no discharges from the device since starting the appropriate beta blocker. In conclusion, these patients appear to respond well to beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy with decreased ectopic complexity and an increased heart rate threshold for inducing VA.

4 DISCUSSION

The main findings of this study included: (1) Almost half of patients with frequent PVCs were asymptomatic, and only one‐third had palpitations clearly correlated with PVCs; (2) Females were more likely to experience palpitations; (3) Young people had a lower likelihood of experiencing symptoms compared to adults; (4) Patients with palpitations had a higher chance of developing anxiety; (5) Patients with a lower PVC CI ratio and longer Post PVC CI were more likely to have PVC‐relevant palpitations.

In this study, 58% of patients with frequent PVCs complained of palpitations, which is comparable to previous studies. Compared to asymptomatic patients, females make up a higher proportion of those with palpitations. A study by Vicent et al. revealed that palpitations were the most common reason for consultation in females. When comparing the palpitation‐PVC‐relevant group and the PVC‐irrelevant group, we found no gender difference. This suggests that there is no significant difference in the feeling of PVCs between males and females, while females might experience palpitations more often due to causes other than PVCs. According to Ehlers et al. females were more likely than males to be aware of sinus rhythm, and sinus tachycardia is also a common cause of palpitations.

Long QT syndrome — risk with normal QTc and beta-blocker considerations: Approximately 10% to 36% of genotype-positive patients have QTc intervals ≤ 440 ms and, although patients with normal QTc have a lower risk of VA and SCD than those with prolonged QTc, they still have increased risk versus genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched patients. Beta blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events substantially; during the periods of highest risk in the first 3 decades of life, treatment with a beta blocker may reduce risk of SCA. Because QTc changes over time, assessment of QTc on ECG annually or with medication changes and assessment of medication efficacy with exercise testing are indicated, and asymptomatic adult (male) patients with normal QTc intervals may choose to decline beta-blocker therapy.

### Recommendations on the use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in young adult competitive athletes: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111qvVwM]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Arrhythmias in competitive athletes (CA) presenting with palpitations or subjective arrhythmias that occur or intensify during exercise should undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to diagnose or exclude underlying structural disease, and additional imaging with CMR may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis. These patients should also undergo maximal effort-limited exercise testing with or without adjunctive imaging as dictated by current guidelines. CTA and CMR imaging in CA with suspected arrhythmia should be considered second line and be performed as dictated by suspected or confirmed pathology following TTE, and CMR should be performed following a normal TTE examination among CA with documented complex ventricular arrhythmia to evaluate for underlying myocardial scar. For ventricular pre-excitation, both asymptomatic and symptomatic CA should undergo TTE to exclude concomitant Ebstein's anomaly, PRKAG2 gene-mediated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and complex forms of congenital heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining left ventricular (LV) function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (generally > 15% of beats and predominantly of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms and LV function. Frequent PVCs (usually > 15% of the total number of beats) may produce a reversible form of LV dysfunction, and LV dysfunction has been associated with greater PVC burden (> 10% and usually > 20%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a retrograde P-wave after the PVCs, and interpolated PVCs. In a prospective study of catheter ablation for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ablation was completely successful in 80% of patients, and LV function normalized within 6 months in 82% of the 22 patients who had depressed ventricular function at baseline. In a double-blind parallel study of 30 patients with or without ischemic heart disease with > 30 PVCs per hour, proarrhythmic effects were present in 1 patient on sotalol; there was no significant difference in suppression of PVCs (sotalol 65%, propranolol 44%), with reduction in ventricular couplets being 39% for sotalol and 49% for propranolol, and there was a significant increase in QTc in patients on sotalol.

### HRS / EHRA / APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in may 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 [^112Z7VKa]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Medium credibility.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) diagnosis — CPVT patients present a normal resting ECG, occasionally with a lower than normal heart rate, and with exercise ventricular ectopy develops, increasing in complexity from monomorphic ventricular premature beats (VPBs) to polymorphic VPBs and bidirectional or polymorphic VT. Holter monitoring, exercise stress test or implantable loop recorders are therefore pivotal investigations for establishing the diagnosis, while programmed electrical stimulation has no diagnostic or prognostic value as either bidirectional or polymorphic VT is not inducible. Drug challenge with epinephrine or isoproterenol may elicit arrhythmias and is useful in patients who are unable to exercise, and adrenergically mediated atrial arrhythmias are also common manifestations.

### Fitness-related cardiac arrhythmias… [^115aMduP]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Fitness-related atrial fibrillation/flutter should be suspected when athletic individuals who are in their 30s or 40s or older report symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness when they are at rest or exercising. If the symptoms are occasional and atrial fibrillation/flutter is not confirmed with resting electrocardiography, a cardiac event monitor can be used to detect the arrhythmia, with the duration of monitoring determined by the anticipated frequency of the patient's symptoms. Once an arrhythmia is confirmed, the patient should be asked about the use of performance-enhancing stimulants, although it is not clear whether they contribute to atrial fibrillation/flutter in athletes. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of fitness-related atrial fibrillation/flutter, although a reduction in exercise is often recommended.

In a European study, male athletes reported fewer arrhythmic episodes after reducing athletic activity; the response was greater in younger athletes than in older athletes. 9 However, many highly active individuals may be reluctant to decrease their exercise intensity. The optimal antiarrhythmic treatment is controversial. Some experts recommend ablation as a first-line therapy, whereas others recommend antiarrhythmic drugs as initial treatement. 10, 11 Anticoagulation should be considered to prevent embolic stroke when atrial fibrillation is present, depending on the individual's risk score and bleeding risk. Final Comments Family physicians should always encourage appropriate physical activity levels, such as those recommended in the U. S.

Department of Health and Human Services' Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. 19 The benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks, but physicians should be alert for cardiac arrhythmias in patients who are physically fit and appear to have minimal risk of heart disease. Patients should be counseled to consider moderating their exercise so that it is closer to the recommended levels. Some require support in coming to terms with diagnoses they have done everything possible to avoid. In our own experience, we each had reactions of "It's not fair" or "I'm shocked and insulted that I could have heart disease, " and we appreciated the understanding of our physicians during recovery.

### Evaluation and management of vasovagal syncope… [^117HR1JK]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is characterized by the common faint, resulting from "vagally" mediated cardioinhibition. The resulting brady-cardia reduces cerebral blood flow to a level inadequate to maintain consciousness. Because of the episodic nature of vasovagal syncope and the heterogeneity of the patient population, it is difficult to make specific therapy recommendations. Fenton and associates reviewed the current understanding of vasovagal syncope to provide a diagnostic and therapeutic approach. There are no specific physical signs related to vasovagal syncope. Tilt-table testing provokes venous pooling and resultant vasovagal syncope. Pharmacologic agents used to emphasize this effect are not well standardized.

Testing is warranted in patients whose syncope is uncertain to be vasovagal and in patients with one or more of the following indications: recurrent syncope, a single syncope episode associated with injury, a single syncope episode associated with a high-risk setting, or syncope of another established cause whose treatment might be affected by vasovagal syncope. Treatment is empiric because the specific physiologic triggers of vasovagal syncope are largely unidentified. Infrequent episodes require only counseling and observation. Hydration and salt intake may need to be increased, especially in warm weather. Pharmacologic treatment options include beta-adrenergic blockers, anticholinergic agents, adenosine receptor blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mineralocorticoids and anticonvulsants. The use of compression hose and pacemakers has been recommended.

The authors conclude that beta blockers are probably the appropriate first-line agent in most cases of vasovagal syncope because of their antagonistic actions to catecholamines. Clinical guidelines for can be based on blood pressure and vital signs. A conservative nondrug approach should be used in patients with infrequent occurrences and recognizable prodromal symptoms. The role of pacing is unclear at present. Counseling about avoidance of volume depletion is important for all patients with vasovagal syncope. editor's note: Common presentations ofvasovagal syncope include episodes occurringafter a painful or fearful stimulus. Patientsmay faint after prolonged standing or exertion. A tilt-table test is the best diagnostic test; the hemodynamic and catecholamine response during the test simulates those occurring during a vasovagal syncopal episode andwill provoke a syncopal episode in susceptiblepersons.

### Exercise-related syncope in the young athlete… [^113kB7ow]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Prodromal symptoms occurring during exercise, including palpitations, chest pain, nausea, wheezing and pruritis, are also significant. As in the evaluation of syncope in nonathletes, it is also important to identify whether syncope or dizziness occurs only in the upright position or also during sitting or supine positions. SPECIAL TESTS AND REFERRAL Numerous special tests may be warranted in the evaluation of young athletes with exercise-induced syncope. The two most fundamental tests, however, are the echocardiogram and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography, which should precede exercise stress testing, allows the clinician to assess ventricular size and function, estimate pulmonary pressures and rule out valvular dysfunction.

In young athletes, echocardiography can specifically assist in making the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. The exercise stress test should be performed after the echocardiogram. Rather than using a standard Bruce protocol, a test should be designed to reproduce the conditions that provoked the specific syncopal event and challenge the individual athlete. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity test for a runner might be performed. The exercise electrocardiogram should also be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Unexplained exercise-related syncope warrants restriction and an evaluation beginning with echocardiography preceding exercise stress testing.

A diagnosis made with the preceding tests should be managed as appropriate, while negative testing may warrant either careful observation or referral to a cardiologist for consideration of more advanced testing. In patients with an unremarkable echocardiogram and exercise stress test, a presumptive diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope may be the conclusion. If the event was clearly postexertional by history, nonrecurrent and associated with a normal physical examination and a normal ECG, patients may safely return to vigorous activity with careful observation. Athletes whose clinical pictures do not meet these criteria, on the other hand, warrant further evaluation by a cardiologist.

### Palpitations: evaluation in the primary care setting… [^115eMPB6]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Although syncope or presyncope can occur with vasovagal syncope, its occurrence during exertion in an athlete is of particular concern because of the increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia that may result in sudden cardiac death. In young athletes, the incidence of sudden cardiac death is estimated to be one to three cases per 100, 000 person-years. 20 Etiologies include cardiomyopathies, congenital coronary anomalies, and ion channelopathies.
20. 13 Other substances that may cause palpitations include performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids. 13, 22 Nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol are commonly used legal substances that may induce palpitations. 4, 5, 7 A prolonged QT interval suggests polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, whereas a short PR interval or delta wave suggests a reentrant tachycardia via an accessory pathway.

24 Nonspecific ST-segment changes and T-wave abnormalities may be important clues to the presence of myocardial disease. Patients with exertional symptoms should be evaluated with standard exercise stress testing because they are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. 17 Patients in whom at least 25% of heartbeats are VPCs have an increased risk of VPC-induced cardiomyopathy. Patients with a decreased ejection fraction have VPCs more often than those with normal left ventricular function. 32 Persistent or hemodynamically significant SVT can be aborted with intravenous adenosine; calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or other antiarrhythmics can also be used. 8 In refractory cases, synchronized cardioversion can be considered for short-term treatment, or radiofrequency catheter ablation for longer-term treatment. 27 Patients with SVT or syncope associated with palpitations should be referred to a cardiologist.

8 It may be life-threatening and should trigger immediate intervention and consultation with a cardiologist. It is important to note that use of medications such as beta blockers is contraindicated in these patients because they may result in syncope and increase the risk of death. In one study of persons included in the International Long QT Syndrome Registry, those with a long QT interval who were subsequently prescribed a beta blocker had a 3. 6-fold increase in the risk of severe arrhythmic events. 19.
