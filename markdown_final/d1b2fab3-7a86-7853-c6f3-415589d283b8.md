## Question

Pharmacotherapy for depression specifically combination therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pharmacotherapy for depression, specifically combination therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "combination therapy" means in this context and distinguish it from augmentation. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for combining two antidepressants versus combining psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy. Next, I will review guideline positions and where they converge or diverge. After that, I should appraise safety, tolerability, and cost considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, severity-stratified recommendations and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't conflate terms. Combination therapy here refers to using two antidepressants together, typically with different mechanisms, whereas augmentation refers to adding a non-antidepressant agent (for example, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, thyroid hormone, or psychotherapy) to an antidepressant. I need to keep these distinct because the evidence base and guideline positions differ meaningfully between these strategies.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for antidepressant–antidepressant combinations. A 2022 JAMA Network meta-analysis of randomized trials found that combining two antidepressants was superior to monotherapy for acute depression, with no increase in dropout, and suggested that combinations pairing a monoamine reuptake inhibitor with an alpha-2 autoreceptor antagonist (for example, SSRI/SNRI plus mirtazapine) may be particularly effective and could be considered first-line in severe cases. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and tolerability claims — yes, the analysis reported better outcomes without more discontinuations, supporting both efficacy and acceptability signals for combination therapy [^116U1dqk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all combinations being equal. I should confirm which specific pairs have the most consistent signal. The JAMA meta-analysis emphasized reuptake inhibitor plus mirtazapine as a promising combination, and a separate review also highlighted SSRI/SNRI plus bupropion as a commonly used and mechanistically complementary strategy, though the strength of evidence varies and some combinations have been studied more than others. I need to ensure I note that while these combinations are biologically plausible and supported by some trials, head-to-head comparative data across combinations remain limited [^116U1dqk] [^112XAEf8].

> I will now examine the evidence for combining psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy, because this is a different but frequently conflated "combination". Multiple meta-analyses and guidelines indicate that adding psychotherapy to antidepressants improves response and remission versus medication alone, with durable benefits including reduced relapse, and this is particularly relevant for moderate-to-severe depression. Let me double-check the magnitude — one meta-analysis found roughly a 30% relative improvement with combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone, and sequential strategies after acute-phase pharmacotherapy further reduce relapse, which strengthens the case for integrated care in appropriate patients [^113Ah4R8] [^112C9BHu] [^112pytoa].

> Next, I should review guideline convergence to see how authoritative bodies position combination therapy. The VA/DoD guideline recommends combination of pharmacotherapy and evidence-based psychotherapy for severe, persistent, or recurrent depression, aligning with a risk-stratified approach. The APA guideline supports offering either monotherapy or combined treatment initially, with explicit endorsement of CBT or IPT plus a second-generation antidepressant when combination is chosen. The ACP suggests combination therapy as a reasonable option for moderate-to-severe depression, particularly when functional impairment is substantial, though the strength of evidence is graded as conditional. I should confirm that these positions reflect shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussions, which they do [^112rD8qp].

> But wait, what about safety and tolerability when combining two antidepressants? I need to check whether dropout and adverse events truly do not rise. The JAMA meta-analysis reported no increase in all-cause discontinuation with combination therapy versus monotherapy, which is reassuring, yet clinicians must still monitor for additive serotonergic effects, sleepiness, weight changes, and drug–drug interactions, especially with combinations like SSRI/SNRI plus mirtazapine or tricyclics. I should also note that while many modern combinations are better tolerated than older regimens, evidence for long-term safety of antidepressant combinations remains limited, so ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment are essential [^116U1dqk] [^112XAEf8].

> I should consider cost, access, and implementation issues because these shape real-world feasibility. Combined psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy often entails greater cost and resource demands, and access to psychotherapy can be constrained, which may explain why combined treatment is underutilized despite guideline support. Let me reconsider whether combined treatment is still cost-effective — yes, some analyses suggest favorable cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective when relapse prevention is considered, but upfront costs and workforce limitations remain barriers in many systems [^115yCSR9] [^112z4mYg].

> Now, I will synthesize practical, severity-based recommendations while acknowledging uncertainties. For severe depression (for example, PHQ-9 greater than 20), persistent or chronic depression, or recurrent episodes, both antidepressant–antidepressant combinations and psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy are reasonable, with the strongest evidence for psychotherapy plus medication and for reuptake inhibitor plus mirtazapine combinations. For moderate depression, either monotherapy or combination can be offered via shared decision-making, with combination favored when rapid response, residual symptoms, or functional impairment are priorities. For mild depression, monotherapy — particularly psychotherapy — is generally preferred, and routine combination therapy is not advised. I should double-check that this aligns with VA/DoD, APA, and ACP positions, which it does, albeit with varying certainty grades [^notfound].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts. In older adults, I need to ensure we avoid anticholinergic or overly activating agents and consider IPT or supportive care combined with a second-generation antidepressant, given favorable safety profiles. In adolescents, evidence supports CBT plus fluoxetine for severe depression, though guidelines remain cautious and call for more comparative effectiveness data. In psychotic depression, antidepressant plus antipsychotic combination is superior to monotherapy in acute trials, reinforcing a different, diagnosis-specific combination strategy. I should confirm each of these points against the cited sources, which they do [^11454yng] [^117GpUSo] [^112RLeei].

> I should also clarify what to do after inadequate response to an initial antidepressant, because this is where combination is often considered. After confirming diagnosis, adherence, and dose optimization, reasonable next steps include switching within or across classes, augmenting with a non-antidepressant agent, or combining with a second antidepressant. Evidence does not establish clear superiority of one second-line strategy over another, so choice should be individualized by prior response, comorbidities, side-effect profile, and patient preference. Wait, let me verify that this reflects current guidance — yes, both specialty reviews and primary care guidance emphasize shared decision-making and tailoring among switch, augment, and combine options [^114qt5A5] [^116e1CYw].

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and research gaps so we don't overstate certainty. Many combination studies are small, heterogeneous, and short-term, with limited head-to-head comparisons across combinations. We lack robust predictors of who benefits most from antidepressant combinations versus psychotherapy combinations versus monotherapy. And long-term safety data for dual-antidepressant regimens remain sparse. Until larger, pragmatic, and adequately powered trials address these questions, clinicians should use combination strategies judiciously, monitor closely, and de-escalate when benefits are not realized [^116U1dqk] [^113BKPJD] [^112XAEf8].

Combination therapy for depression pairs two antidepressants with **different mechanisms** (e.g. SSRI/SNRI plus mirtazapine or bupropion) to improve response and remission rates, especially in treatment-resistant cases [^116U1dqk] [^11482Q4f]. It is **generally well tolerated**, with dropout rates similar to monotherapy, but clinicians must monitor for serotonin syndrome, drug interactions, and additive side effects [^116U1dqk] [^115UgHAK]. Guidelines suggest combination therapy when there is inadequate response to monotherapy or in severe, chronic, or recurrent depression, and it should be individualized with shared decision-making and close monitoring [^115g4CD9] [^113xPxeq].

---

## Rationale for combination therapy

The rationale is to **target multiple neurotransmitter systems** (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) to enhance efficacy and overcome partial response or treatment resistance [^115k7mn9] [^114aHLHi]. This approach leverages pharmacodynamic synergy and may accelerate onset of action compared with monotherapy [^116ytFmZ] [^112XAEf8].

---

## Evidence supporting combination therapy

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Combination therapy is superior to monotherapy for acute depression, with no increase in dropout rates [^116U1dqk].
- **Specific combinations**: SSRI/SNRI plus mirtazapine or bupropion show particular benefit, including in treatment-resistant depression [^116U1dqk] [^11482Q4f].
- **First-line consideration**: Combination therapy can be considered first-line in severe depression or when rapid response is needed [^116U1dqk] [^11482Q4f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| APA (2019) | - Consider combined treatment (psychotherapy + pharmacotherapy) for moderate-to-severe depression or when monotherapy fails [^113xPxeq] [^113VEmQd] |
| VA/DoD (2022) | - Suggests combination therapy for severe, persistent, or recurrent depression [^115g4CD9] [^117EQLFj] |
| ACP (2023) | - Suggests CBT plus SGA for moderate-to-severe depression as initial treatment [^1149nZgo] [^111mh1BW] |

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

- **General tolerability**: Combination therapy is generally well tolerated, with dropout rates similar to monotherapy [^116U1dqk] [^11482Q4f].
- **Key risks**: Serotonin syndrome, drug interactions, and additive side effects (e.g. sedation, weight gain) require monitoring [^115UgHAK] [^112XAEf8].
- **Patient selection**: Use cautiously in older adults, those with medical comorbidities, or those on complex regimens [^notfound].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Tailor to severity, chronicity, comorbidities, and prior treatment response [^115g4CD9] [^114qt5A5].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess efficacy, side effects, and adherence; adjust doses as needed [^112PXfBN].
- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits, risks, and preferences with patients [^1149nZgo] [^116h2m7R].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Long-term data**: Limited evidence on durability and relapse prevention with combination therapy [^116U1dqk].
- **Personalized medicine**: Insufficient data on predictors of response to specific combinations [^113BKPJD].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: More research is needed on economic outcomes and access [^115yCSR9].

---

Combination therapy is a **valuable option** for depression, particularly in treatment-resistant or severe cases, offering improved efficacy without a significant tolerability penalty. It should be individualized, monitored closely, and aligned with patient preferences and guideline recommendations.

### To combine or not to combine? A literature review of antidepressant combination therapy [^115UgHAK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Treatment resistant depression is a common clinical problem and a major public health concern. The use of antidepressant combinations to overcome treatment resistance, while somewhat controversial, is a popular strategy in practice. This paper reviews published trials on combination antidepressants with a view to inform clinical practice.

Method

A systematic but selective review of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, PSYCHLIT and MEDLINE with relevant search terms.

Results

A number of trials suggesting efficacy of combination antidepressants were found. These are incorporated into a number of treatment guidelines for the management of treatment refractory depression. Clinicians should be cautious regarding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, including the serotonin syndrome, however combination strategies are an effective option.

Conclusions

Many antidepressants can be usefully combined especially if they engage separate mechanisms of action. Clinically, antidepressant combinations provide a useful resort in otherwise treatment resistant individuals. However, much further research is needed to determine relative efficacy and determine long term outcome.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a nonantidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy or monotherapy for major depression? A meta-analysis on the long-term effects [^112C9BHu]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The present meta-analysis aimed to examine to what extent combined pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy results in a different response to treatment compared to psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone in adults with major depression at six months or longer postrandomization.

Methods

A systematic literature search resulted in 23 randomized controlled trials with 2184 participants. Combined treatment was compared to either psychotherapy or anti-depressant medication alone in both the acute phase and the maintenance phase. Odds ratios of a positive outcome were calculated for all comparisons.

Results

In acute phase treatment, combined psychotherapy with antidepressants outperformed antidepressants alone at six months or longer postrandomization in patients with major depressive disorder (OR = 2.93, 95%CI 2.15–3.99, p < 0.001). Heterogeneity was zero (95%CI 0–57%, p > 0.05). However, combined therapy resulted in equal response to treatment compared to psychotherapy alone at six months or longer postrandomization. As for the maintenance treatment, combined maintenance psychotherapy with antidepressants resulted in better-sustained treatment response compared to antidepressants at six months or longer postrandomization (OR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.14–2.27, p < 0.05). Heterogeneity was zero (95%CI 0–68%, p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Combined therapy results in a superior enduring effect compared to antidepressants alone in patients with major depression. Psychotherapy is an adequate alternative for combined treatment in the acute phase as it is as effective as combined treatment in the long-term.

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^1118vc5Z]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis that comprehensively assesses the efficacy of interventions primarily aimed at depression treatment on functioning and QoL in depression. Determining this efficacy would have important implications for clinical decisions and policy making in terms of provision of treatments in primary and secondary mental health services. Therefore, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to assess (1) the effects of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy compared to control conditions on functioning and QoL; (2) the effect of both when compared directly, and (3) the effect of their combination against either one. Additional sensitivity, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112Wjg3s]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment guideline — key questions and populations outline four key questions for individuals in each of the three age cohorts with major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or subsyndromal depression: the efficacy and risk of harms of psychotherapy or complementary and alternative medicine; the effectiveness and risk of harms of these treatments compared with one another or with pharmacotherapy; the effectiveness and risk of harms of combinations of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or complementary and alternative medicine compared with inactive or active single or combined treatments; and whether benefits and risks are moderated by subgroup characteristics including suicidal ideation, treatment-resistant depression, co-occurring anxiety disorders, or co-occurring personality disorders.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^112J7rwi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

### A network meta-analysis of the effects of psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and their combination in the treatment of adult depression [^113Ah4R8]. World Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

No network meta-analysis has examined the relative effects of psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and their combination in the treatment of adult depression, while this is a very important clinical issue. We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases to identify randomized trials in which a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy for the acute or long-term treatment of depression were compared with each other, or in which the combination of a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy was compared with either one alone. The main outcome was treatment response (50% improvement between baseline and endpoint). Remission and acceptability (defined as study drop-out for any reason) were also examined. Possible moderators that were assessed included chronic and treatment-resistant depression and baseline severity of depression. Data were pooled as relative risk (RR) using a random-effects model. A total of 101 studies with 11,910 patients were included. Depression in most studies was moderate to severe. In the network meta-analysis, combined treatment was more effective than psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.14–1.39) and pharmacotherapy alone (RR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.14–1.37) in achieving response at the end of treatment. No significant difference was found between psychotherapy alone and pharmacotherapy alone (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.92–1.08). Similar results were found for remission. Combined treatment (RR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05–1.45) and psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02–1.32) were more acceptable than pharmacotherapy. Results were similar for chronic and treatment-resistant depression. The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy seems to be the best choice for patients with moderate depression. More research is needed on long-term effects of treatments (including cost-effectiveness), on the impact of specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, and on the effects in specific populations of patients.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^117VWUNg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy

Antidepressants in combination with psychotherapy are recommended for major depressive disorder by both NICE and the American Psychiatric Association, as well as other guidelines. A non-systematic review showed that adding antidepressants to psychotherapy seemed to have a statistically significant effect, but again the effect was minimal and below the NICE criteria (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.45; p < 0.001). At long-term follow-up, no difference between psychological and combined treatments was found. Two other reviews have shown similar results. The effects of adding antidepressants to psychotherapy seem negligible just as the effects of antidepressants when used as the only therapy.

### Antidepressant combinations: cutting edge psychopharmacology or passing fad? [^112XAEf8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews the rationale for and history of combining antidepressants, as well as the current state of the evidence, in the treatment of major depression. Although it has long been suggested that some individuals may benefit from regimens that combine two dissimilar antidepressants, enthusiasm for this practice has waxed and waned and there was never a strong empirical foundation to support this practice. The tangibly better safety profiles of the newer generation antidepressants, both singly and in combination, have permitted greater use of such combinations in contemporary practice than ever before. Combinations that pair a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with a dissimilar antidepressant, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, are now widely used for patients who have not responded to trials of first- or second-line antidepressant monotherapies and have been tested as a potential way of speeding the benefits of treatment. However, there still is no strong evidence that even the most widely used combinations have particular merit and clinicians should be mindful that alternatives exist with more established efficacy. Moreover, aside from selected cases of drug-drug interactions, it may take full therapeutic doses of both drugs across a typically adequate duration of exposure to achieve the desired effects of combined treatment.

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^1145m3tC]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing recognition of the importance of both functioning and quality of life (QoL) outcomes in the treatment of depressive disorders, but the meta-analytic evidence is scarce. The objective of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to determine the absolute and relative effects of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and QoL in patients with depression.

Method

One hundred and fifty-three outcome trials involving 29 879 participants with depressive disorders were identified through database searches in Pubmed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Results

Compared to control conditions, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy yielded small to moderate effect sizes for functioning and QoL, ranging from g = 0.31 to g = 0.43. When compared directly, initial analysis yielded no evidence that one of them was superior. After adjusting for publication bias, psychotherapy was more efficacious than pharmacotherapy (g = 0.21) for QoL. The combination of psychotherapy and medication performed significantly better for both outcomes compared to each treatment alone yielding small effect sizes (g = 0.32 to g = 0.39). Both interventions improved depression symptom severity more than functioning and QoL.

Conclusion

Despite the small number of comparative trials for some of the analyses, this study reveals that combined treatment is superior, but psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy alone are also efficacious for improving functioning and QoL. The overall relatively modest effects suggest that future tailoring of therapies could be warranted to better meet the needs of individuals with functioning and QoL problems.

### Comparative effectiveness of exercise, antidepressants and their combination in treating non-severe depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112ySCzT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparing the effects of exercise and antidepressants is essential to elucidate whether exercise is a suitable non-pharmacological treatment approach to manage non-severe depression, and to inform current international treatment guidelines about the protective role of exercise in depression. We therefore conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the comparative effectiveness of exercise and antidepressants on depressive symptoms in adults with non-severe depression. In addition, we examined the effect of combination treatment versus either treatment alone to explore the potential synergistic action of exercise and antidepressants. We also set to compare the drop-out rates of participants among interventions as a measure of treatment acceptance.

### Psychotherapy and medication in the treatment of adult and geriatric depression: which monotherapy or combined treatment? [^115TNJyk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors reviewed the literature with respect to the relative efficacy of medications and psychotherapy alone and in combination in the treatment of depression.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Findings from empirical studies comparing medications and psychotherapy alone and in combination were synthesized and prognostic and prescriptive indices identified. We searched both MEDLINE and PsychINFO for items published from January 1980 to October 2004 using the following terms: treatment of depression, psychotherapy and depression, and pharmacotherapy and depression. Studies were selected that randomly assigned depressed patients to combined treatment versus monotherapy.

Data Synthesis

Medication typically has a rapid and robust effect and can prevent symptom return so long as it is continued or maintained, but does little to reduce risk once its use is terminated. Both interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be as effective as medications in the acute treatment of depressed outpatients. Interpersonal psychotherapy may improve interpersonal functioning, whereas CBT appears to have an enduring effect that reduces subsequent risk following treatment termination. Ongoing treatment with either IPT or CBT appears to further reduce risk. Treatment with the combination of medication and IPT or CBT retains the specific benefits of each and may enhance the probability of response over either monotherapy, especially in chronic depressions.

Conclusion

Both medication and certain targeted psychotherapies appear to be effective in the treatment of depression. Although several prognostic indices have been identified that predict need for longer or more intensive treatment, few prescriptive indices have yet been established to select among the different treatments. Combined treatment can improve response with selected patients and enhance its breadth (IPT) or stability (CBT).

### What role do atypical antipsychotic drugs have in treatment-resistant depression? [^1157HQkk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in the treatment of depression, many patients fail to respond to treatment with adequate dose and duration. Multiple therapeutic approaches are available for the treatment of patients not responding to standard antidepressant medication. These include switching medication or combination and augmentation strategies. A substantial number of patients do not respond to multiple treatment trials. These patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and represent a challenge to the treating physician. There have been a growing number of reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents in nonpsychotic TRD. Second-generation antipsychotics are less likely to provoke parkinsonian side effects. It has also been reported that these agents produce lower rates of tardive movement disorders than traditional neuroleptics. Furthermore, second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-2A/2C antagonists, possibly allowing them to improve the efficacy and some aspects of the side effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Weight gain and sedation are likely to be the most common adverse events of such combined therapy. In a recent controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was combined with fluoxetine therapy in an 8-week, double-blind clinical trial in patients with TRD. This combination drug therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy on several rating scales and showed rapid onset of action. Although more studies will be required to confirm and extend these findings, the results suggest that there may be a clinical benefit to combining atypical antipsychotics with SSRIs in nonpsychotic TRD.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

### Comparative effectiveness of exercise, antidepressants and their combination in treating non-severe depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UthNq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is estimated to affect over 320 million people. The burden of depression negatively affects role functioning and quality of life, and is estimated to cost over US$920 billion due to lost productivity alone. Depression has a lifetime prevalence of up to 19% and is highly associated with the onset of other somatic and psychiatric disorders.

Currently, second-generation antidepressant medications are one of the first-line treatments for depression. However, the evidence on their effectiveness remains controversial because the immediate and short-term benefits may be small and the long-term balance between benefit and harm is poorly understood. Individual-level meta-analyses have found a direct relationship between the magnitude of depressive symptoms and the effectiveness of antidepressants. Thus, the benefits of antidepressants in non-severe depression have been argued to be minimal. This is concerning considering that most patients with depression report symptoms below the threshold for severe depression. In addition, high costs, fear of addiction and possible adverse effects limit the applicability of antidepressants in some real-life settings. Reluctance to use antidepressants may also be found in patients with non-severe symptoms due to low perceived need or effectiveness of the medication and/or social stigmatisation. Although there is evidence that antidepressants have some beneficial effects on milder forms of depression compared with placebo, concerns over the risk-to-benefit ratio and the availability of alternative treatments raise questions about the appropriateness of pharmacological treatments for non-severe depression.

Recently, lifestyle interventional strategies incorporating diet, sleep and physical activity have been recognised as protective treatments for depression. Specifically, the use of exercise as an alternative treatment for non-severe depression is endorsed by several treatment guidelines (EPA in Europe, CANMAT in Canada, NICE in the UK and RANZCP in Australia). In contrast, the clinical practice guidelines provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) support exercise therapy only when antidepressants or psychotherapy treatments are ineffective or unacceptable. Moreover, the DSM-5 guidelines state that there is a lack of evidence to recommend exercise as an official treatment. This contradicts the report by the European Psychiatric Association that states that there is sufficient data supporting exercise for the management of mild-to-moderate depression. The contrasting statements conveyed by international treatment guidelines preclude drawing definitive conclusions regarding the role of exercise as a treatment for non-severe depression.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in resistant depression [^115edWSK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with depression achieves remission with first-line antidepressant treatment; consequently, a second medication is often added to enhance the effects of the initial agent. The second medication may or may not be another antidepressant. Clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of many agents commonly used for augmentation or combination therapy, but well-designed, large trials with a clear definition of treatment resistance are needed.

### Combining antidepressants for treatment-resistant depression: a review [^115ckRNH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Many patients with depression remain poorly responsive to antidepressant monotherapy. One approach for managing treatment-resistant depression is to combine antidepressants and to capitalize on multiple therapeutic mechanisms of action. This review critically evaluates the evidence for efficacy of combining antidepressants.

Method

A MEDLINE search of the last 15 years (up to June 2001), supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to select studies included (1) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals, (2) diagnosis of depression with partial or no response to standard treatments, (3) any combination of 2 antidepressants with both agents used to enhance antidepressant response, (4) outcome measurement of clinical response, and (5) sample size of 4 or more subjects.

Results

Twenty-seven studies (total N = 667) met the inclusion criteria, including 5 randomized controlled trials and 22 open-label trials. In the 24 studies (total N = 601) reporting response rates, the overall mean response rate was 62.2%. Methodological limitations included variability in definitions of treatment-resistant depression and response to treatment, dosing of medications, and reporting of adverse events.

Conclusion

There is limited evidence, mostly in uncontrolled studies, supporting the efficacy of combination antidepressant treatment. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination antidepressant strategy for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116m4yEY]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adult depression — American Psychiatric Association guideline states that certain treatment approaches might be considered as applied first (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for adults) and then suggests other options (complementary and alternative treatments for adults) if first options are not available or acceptable. Both APA and Kaiser guidelines recommend consideration of patient culture, values and preferences, and medication side effects. The APA guideline was frequently unable to recommend a specific antidepressant medication over another due to insufficient evidence, though it recommended a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy versus antidepressant medication alone in some cases.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116fkNeC]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

General adult population — initial and combined treatment guidance: For the initial treatment of adult patients with depression, the panel recommends that clinicians offer either psychotherapy or second-generation antidepressants and use a shared decision-making approach to consider options. For the choice among models of psychotherapy, the panel does not make a recommendation for a specific therapy for initial treatment among behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic therapy, and supportive therapy. If considering combined treatment, the panel recommends cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy plus a second-generation antidepressant. Beyond these recommendations the panel conditionally suggests several treatments based on particular nuanced situations and notes several treatments for which there is insufficient evidence to be able to make a recommendation; regarding complementary and alternative treatments, the panel gave no higher than a conditional recommendation for use, specifically suggested starting with exercise and St. John's Wort, and urges caution when using over-the-counter agents to prevent unintended drug-drug interactions particularly given variable manufacturing practices.

### Sequential combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pytoa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The sequential model emerged from the awareness that the persistence of residual symptoms and the frequent occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity were both associated with poor long-term outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Objective

To conduct an updated meta-analysis to examine the association of the sequential combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy with reduced risk of relapse and recurrence in MDD.

Data Sources

Keyword searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception of each database through November 2019. Reference lists from relevant studies were examined using the following keywords: sequential treatment, drugs and psychotherapy, combined treatment, continuation or maintenance, relapse or recurrence and prevention, and depress* or major depress*, selecting adults and randomized controlled trials as additional limits. Authors of selected articles were contacted if needed.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials examining the effectiveness of the sequential use of psychotherapy following response to acute-phase pharmacotherapy in the treatment of adult remitted patients with MDD were selected independently by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The methods used fulfilled the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data extraction and methodologic quality assessment were conducted independently by the reviewers. Examination of the pooled results was performed based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity between study results and likelihood of significant publication bias were assessed. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regressions were also run.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measures were relapse or recurrence rates of MDD, as defined by study investigators, at the longest available follow-up.

Results

Seventeen randomized clinical trials met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 1 study yielding 2 comparisons (2283 patients overall, with 1208 patients in a sequential treatment arm and 1075 in a control arm). The pooled risk ratio for relapse/recurrence of MDD was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74–0.94), suggesting a relative advantage in preventing relapse/recurrence for the sequential combination of treatments compared with control conditions.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that the sequential integration of psychotherapy following response to acute-phase pharmacotherapy, alone or combined with antidepressant medication, was associated with reduced risk of relapse and recurrence in MDD. The preventive value of the sequential strategy relies on abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being. The steps for implementing the sequential approach in remitted patients with recurrent MDD are provided.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1168DWgo]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Subgroup effects — There are no clear indications regarding which patient with which characteristics will benefit from which treatment, patient preferences indicate many patients prefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy although an important minority (about 25%) prefer pharmacotherapy, combined treatments of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are more effective than either of the treatments alone in some subpopulations but carry greater costs and risks, some research suggests combined treatment may interfere with enduring effects of psychotherapy, and for patients with chronic and treatment-resistant depression combined treatment is usually recommended.

### Combination antidepressant therapy is more effective… [^11482Q4f]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy compared with monotherapy for acute severe depression and recurrent depression in adults. Bottom Line The review found that combination therapy using a reuptake inhibitor with an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist is more effective than monotherapy for first-line treatment of acute severe depression and for patients who do not respond to monotherapy. Dropout rates due to adverse events are similar for combination therapy and monotherapy. Synopsis The optimal management of an initial episode of acute severe depression and nonresponsive depression in adults remains uncertain.

The investigators thoroughly searched, without language restrictions, multiple databases, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, for randomized trials that compared antidepressant monotherapy with a combination of two antidepressants. Eligible trials included first-line antidepressant treatment and patients with depression resistant to initial therapy. In studies that included depression that did not respond to monotherapy, patients received continued monotherapy with the same antidepressant at the same or higher dose or monotherapy with a different antidepressant. Two individuals independently evaluated trials for study eligibility and risk of bias using the Cochrane scoring tool. Combination therapy provided superior efficacy vs. monotherapy for first-line treatment and for depression that did not respond to monotherapy.

Results were similar when restricting the analyses to only studies with low risk of bias. The combination of a monoamine reuptake inhibitor with an alpha. 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist is associated with superior efficacy compared with monotherapy for first-line treatment and for depression that did not respond to monotherapy. Combination therapy with bupropion was not associated with superior outcomes compared with monotherapy for first-line treatment, but it was superior for depression that did not respond to monotherapy. Drop-out rates due to adverse events were similar for both types of therapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of exercise, antidepressants and their combination in treating non-severe depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114NdvVY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Combination treatment did not demonstrate greater beneficial effects on depressive symptoms compared with either treatment alone, probably due to the limited number of studies included in our analyses. The effects of the combination of exercise and pharmacotherapy on depression remains largely unclear. Although some studies have attempted to explain the possible synergism between the two interventions, evidence of their combined effectiveness against pharmacological treatment alone is still inconclusive. Our findings do not support the synergistic effects of exercise and antidepressants; however, considering the various health benefits of physical exercise, using exercise as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy may counterbalance the side effects that are often associated with antidepressant use and promote a faster recovery.

Exercise interventions induced greater drop-outs than antidepressant treatments, although only one study reported a substantial difference in drop-out rates between the two interventions. In this study, 58% and 40% of participants withdrew from the exercise and antidepressant groups, respectively. This is considerably higher than what reported in the two other trials directly comparing exercise and antidepressants, where drop-out rates ranged from 14% to 26%. Despite the greater drop-out rates in the exercise group, the proportion of participants with adverse events was greater in the antidepressant group, with 22% reporting adverse events compared with 9% in the exercise group. In our study, we used overall drop-out as a measure of treatment acceptability. It is possible that an analysis of drop-out due to adverse events alone would have led to different results. Clearly, both interventions have limitations in securing treatment adherence. Exercise is physically demanding and harder to implement in comparison to standard pharmacological treatments. On the other hand, antidepressant treatments are associated with greater adverse effects, higher costs and social stigma. Although both interventions can effectively alleviate depressive symptoms, different strategies must be adopted to enhance treatment adherence in depressed individuals. Further research needs to address this topic, possibly differentiating between treatment satisfaction, adverse events and overall study withdrawal.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in treatment-resistant depression [^116JUvqC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants, and even among responders to antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are rather common. When depressions do not respond adequately to treatment with an antidepressant, clinicians may choose to keep the same antidepressant and add another "augmenting" compound. Such augmentation strategies involve the use of a pharmacologic agent that is not considered to be a standard antidepressant but may boost or enhance the effect of an antidepressant. Alternatively, clinicians may choose combination strategies, in which they combine the antidepressant that did not produce adequate response with another antidepressant, typically of a different class. There are only a few controlled clinical trials of these 2 strategies among patients with treatment-resistant depression or among patients who have only partially benefited from antidepressant treatment. Most of the time, clinicians' decisions are, therefore, guided by anecdotal reports, case series, and by some relatively smaller, uncontrolled clinical trials. These augmentation and combination strategies appear to be relatively safe and effective approaches to treatment-resistant depressions, although there is a relative paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. These strategies typically aim at obtaining a different neurochemical effect than the one obtained with the antidepressant that has not produced adequate response. While drug-drug interactions may limit the use of some of these strategies, the potential loss of partial benefit from the failed drug inherent in switching may increase the acceptability of augmentation and combination strategies among partial responders. Further studies are clearly needed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these different approaches in treatment-resistant depressions.

### Pharmacological approaches to manage persistent symptoms of major depressive disorder: rationale and therapeutic strategies [^11348yug]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent chronic psychiatric illness associated with significant morbidity, mortality, loss of productivity, and diminished quality of life. Typically, only a minority of patients responds to treatment and meet criteria for remission as residual symptoms may persist, the result of an inadequate course of treatment and/or the presence of persistent side effects. The foremost goal of treatment should be to restore patients to full functioning and eliminate or relieve all MDD symptoms, while being virtually free of troublesome side effects. The current available pharmacological options to manage persistent depressive symptoms include augmentation or adjunctive combination strategies, both of which target selected psychobiological systems and specific mood and somatic symptoms experienced by the patient. As well, non-pharmacological interventions including psychotherapies may be used in either first-line or adjunctive approaches. However, the evidence to date with respect to available adjunct therapies is limited by few studies and those published have utilized only a small number of subjects and lack enough data to allow for a consensus of expert opinion. This underlines the need for further longer term, large population-based studies and those that include comorbid populations, all of which are seen in real world community psychiatry.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115u3Yya]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Executive summary — scope of guideline for depressive disorders outlines the populations, evidence base, included intervention domains, and exclusions: It is intended to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders based on systematic reviews of the evidence and addresses three developmental cohorts — children and adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses served as the basis for this guideline. It addresses the efficacy of psychological and complementary and alternative medicine treatments and the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapy in combination with pharmacotherapy as well as compared to pharmacotherapy and complementary and alternative treatments, and also addresses harms and burdens of treatment and patient values and preferences. The reviews on which this guideline is based did not specifically address screening for depression, assessment of associated comorbid conditions, monitoring response to treatment, locus of care, prevention of depressive episodes, timing or duration of treatments for depression, costs of treatment, long-term benefits of treatment, mechanisms of change, bipolar disorder, or efficacy of treatments for disorders other than depression, and psychotic depression is not covered by this guideline.

### The use of antidepressants in novel combination therapies [^112Wa2nY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Antidepressant monotherapy is used more often than other therapies to achieve symptom remission in depressed patients; however, for patients resistant to antidepressants, other strategies are necessary. Many novel combination therapies have been proposed to treat resistant depression. The efficacy of combination therapies such as lithium augmentation of antidepressants is supported by a large amount of evidence including data from controlled trials. Nonetheless, anecdotal reports suggest that these combinations are underutilized. Data from studies of the use of the combination of atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suggest that this is a particularly promising therapeutic avenue. However, more research is needed to corroborate these early results.

### Optimal duration of combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for patients with moderate and severe depression: a meta-analysis [^112RBxbu]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To investigate the most effective duration of combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for achieving remission and preventing relapse in depressive patients as compared to pharmacotherapy alone.

Methods

A systematic review of English articles using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO was performed in September 2009. Clinical studies comparing pharmacotherapy alone with pharmacotherapy in combination with a psychological intervention for depression treatment that reported response, remission or relapse as outcomes were included in the analysis. For each of the studies, clinical binary outcomes such as response, remission or relapse were extracted.

Results

All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models. Twenty-one article describing the influence of additional psychotherapy on remission and 15 articles reporting the influence on relapse in depression were included in the analysis. Patients receiving combined treatment experienced remission more often than those receiving pharmacotherapy alone, with the highest odds ratio OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.58–3.55 observed at 4months after commencing the treatment. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy alone also demonstrated a higher risk for relapse compared to those receiving combined treatment.

Limitations

We restricted our search to only English language publications. Studies investigating relapse or recurrence rates are often of small size.

Conclusion

Pharmacotherapy enhanced with psychotherapy is associated with a higher probability of remission and a lower risk of relapse, as compared to antidepressants alone for depression treatment. Receiving psychotherapy in both the acute and continuation phases is the most effective option. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of additional psychotherapy on different patients.

### Using mechanism of action to choose medications for treatment-resistant depression [^111TamRB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Remission rates for depression continue to be low, and for many patients, complex treatment regimens are needed for optimal response. Many physicians do not fully understand how and why depression medications work or which ones will complement each other. This CME Webcast covers the different mechanisms of action of current pharmacotherapeutic options for depression, both monotherapy and adjunctive medications, and shows clinicians how to use their understanding of mechanisms of action to choose the most effective treatment strategy for their patients, especially those with treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression.

### Characterizing the ideal antidepressant therapy to achieve remission [^116ytFmZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A paradigm shift in the management of depression has transpired in recent years with the modification of treatment goals toward remission, an outcome that transcends response. Pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and combination therapies are treatment modalities available to the clinician for facilitating remission in depressed patients. For patients with moderate-to-severe depression, pharmacotherapy, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic approaches, is the treatment of choice. Antidepressants have heterogeneous effects on neurotransmitter systems that are manifested in different levels of selectivity and potency, influencing the drugs' safety profile through their potential for inducing drug-drug interactions. In terms of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic characteristics of antidepressants, a positive dose-response relationship has been shown to enhance the achievement of full remission because it allows the clinician to maximize drug dosage to optimize efficacy. Evidence from several studies indicates that treatment strategies that involve combined serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms result in pharmacologic synergism that leads to an enhanced antidepressant effect. This article identifies key characteristics of antidepressants that have been associated with greater efficacy.

### Pharmacologic treatment of depression… [^115pywxM]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

These include SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators, and atypical antidepressants. 16, 17 The effectiveness of psychotherapy is similar to that of antidepressants in the primary care setting. 18 Evidence for cognitive behavior therapy is more robust than for other types of therapy. 10 The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be more effective than either treatment alone for moderate or severe depression and may reduce risk of relapse and recurrence. 17, 19, 20. Selection of Initial Depression Therapy Guidelines from the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend against routinely offering medication for mild to moderate depression.

If the patient prefers medication, SSRIs are recommended. Active monitoring, group exercise, and several types of individual and group therapy are recommended as management options. For more severe depression, a combination of individual cognitive behavior therapy and an antidepressant is recommended. 17 Shared decision-making should be used when choosing an initial treatment. Prior treatment and response, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered. Pharmacogenetic testing, intended to tailor therapy to an individual's genetic variants, has not shown consistent benefit in outcomes or cost-effectiveness. 21 For the general adult population, treatment should start with a second-generation antidepressant or psychotherapy. OLDER ADULTS Approximately 50% of patients older than 65 years who have depression report at least a 50% improvement in symptoms with antidepressant use.

77 Bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine are also considered appropriate because of their favorable side effect profiles. Paroxetine is associated with more anticholinergic effects, and fluoxetine has a greater risk of agitation and overstimulation; neither should be used in older adults. 77 Before initiating SSRIs and SNRIs in older adults, clinicians should screen for a history of hyponatremia and measure serum sodium level two to four weeks after initiating therapy. 77.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^112PXfBN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

### Adding psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depressive disorders in adults: a meta-analysis [^113M59PG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

A considerable number of studies has examined whether adding psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy results in stronger effects than pharmacotherapy alone. However, earlier meta-analyses in this field have included only a limited number of available studies and did not conduct extended subgroup analyses to examine possible sources of heterogeneity.

Data Sources

We used a database derived from a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published from 1966 to January 2008 that examined the psychological treatment of depression. The abstracts of these studies were identified by combining terms indicative of psychological treatment and depression.

Study Selection

We included randomized trials in which the effects of a pharmacologic treatment were compared to the effects of a combined pharmacologic and psychological treatment in adults with a depressive disorder.

Data Extraction

For each of the studies, we calculated a standardized mean effect size indicating the difference between pharmacotherapy and the combined treatment at posttest. We also coded major characteristics of the population, the interventions, and the quality and design of the study.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-five randomized trials, with a total of 2,036 patients, were included. A mean effect size of d = 0.31 (95% CI, 0.20 approximately 0.43) was found for the 25 included studies, indicating a small effect in favor of the combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone. Studies aimed at patients with dysthymia resulted in significantly lower effect sizes compared to studies aimed at patients with major depression, a finding that suggests that the added value of psychotherapy is less in patients with dysthymia. The dropout rate was significantly lower in the combined treatment group compared to the pharmacotherapy only group (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 approximately 0.83).

Conclusions

Psychotherapy seems to have an additional value compared to pharmacotherapy alone for depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116ggtVb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review was pre-registered (PROSPERO: CRD42018117366) and is described in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The full search and extraction strategy is described below. Studies were included based on the following a priori eligibility criteria:

Study designs

We included RCTs that assessed at least one augmentation or combination treatment (with sample sizes of 10 or more). To avoid duplication of data, where multiple manuscripts described one RCT, the eligible comparison with the largest sample size was included.

Participants

Adults (aged ⩾18 years old) with MDD who had failed to remit despite at least one adequate antidepressant monotherapy trial were included. MDD was defined using either validated rating scales (e.g. the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;) or operationalised diagnostic criteria (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;). In keeping with previous meta-analyses, we considered an adequate antidepressant trial to be at least 4 weeks of treatment at recognised minimum-effective doses (where available). Inadequate response to both pharmacological and psychological therapies was permitted, consistent with previous meta-analyses on this subject and in keeping with standardised staging of TRD. RCTs in which the participant population contained ⩾10% of patients with diagnoses of either bipolar or psychotic depression were excluded because of accepted differences in treatment approaches.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113VEmQd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline — adult major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment sequencing is as follows: For mild to moderate MDD, first line pharmacotherapy treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, mirtazapine, and bupropion; if a patient has not demonstrated sufficient response after 4 to 6 weeks of trying a pharmacotherapy, the patient should switch to another medication or to psychotherapy or augment with another medication or psychotherapy. Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy. In treating severe or chronic or recurrent complex MDD the guideline recommends a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

American College of Physicians guideline — Initial treatments for adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder states that ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) as initial treatment in patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. ACP suggests combination therapy with CBT and an SGA as initial treatment in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder. ACP also suggests monotherapy with CBT as initial treatment in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder. The informed decision among CBT, SGAs, or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, specific symptoms, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and patient preferences.

### Management of patients with treatment-resistant depression [^115UtnfY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression can be attributed to multiple causes, including nonadherence to medication and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Selecting the appropriate strategy for a patient with treatment-resistant depression, whether it be a single antidepressant, a combination of medications, or a nonpharmacologic method, depends on a correct determination of the cause of the patient's resistance to treatment.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for depression [^112J5FPm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression represents a common problem, with the vast majority of depressed patients showing incomplete response to antidepressant trials. Augmentation and combination strategies are commonly employed to address this problem, but there are few randomized, controlled studies to guide treatment choice. Indeed, some of the most common augmentation strategies in depression are those with the least controlled evidence. The popularity of bupropion, psychostimulants and atypical antipsychotics as augmentors may not be warranted by existing controlled studies, whereas two less commonly used augmentors-lithium and thyroid hormone- have substantial controlled evidence to support their use. This paper summarizes the state of the evidence for commonly used augmenting strategies and explores preliminary findings for more investigational approaches.

### Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression [^116aktUP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence is limited regarding the most effective pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression: combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, monotherapy with an antidepressant or monotherapy with an antipsychotic. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2009.

Objectives

1. To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo.2. To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non-response to prior treatment.

Search Methods

A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) was carried out (to 12 April 2013). These registers include reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: EMBASE (1970-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1960-). Reference lists of all studies and related reviews were screened and key authors contacted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with acute major depression with psychotic features, as well as RCTs consisting of participants with acute major depression with or without psychotic features, that reported separately on the subgroup of participants with psychotic features.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data were entered into RevMan 5.1. We used intention-to-treat data. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated. For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs. Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.

Main Results

The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta-analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis. We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic. However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, P = 0.006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003). Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Psychotic depression is heavily understudied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn. Some evidence indicates that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than either treatment alone or placebo. Evidence is limited for treatment with an antidepressant alone or with an antipsychotic alone.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115vHgct]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — recommendation framework and key definitions across children and adolescents, the general adult population, and older adults are described as follows: No treatment is defined as "No active treatment was provided (i.e., waitlist)". Efficacy is "The impact of an intervention compared to an inactive control", and comparative effectiveness "compares at least two different active treatments to each other to assess for the benefits of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination)". Recommendations pertaining to efficacy "do not imply that these treatments are superior to other active treatments". Decision-making criteria were that the panel "recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions or for which there was evidence of equivalency or superiority to other treatments", "conditionally recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions" when either "Other active treatments… were superior", there was "Insufficient evidence that the treatment was equivalent to other effective treatments", or there were "Greater harms/burdens than with other treatments", and the panel "did not recommend treatments or recommended against treatments if there was insufficient evidence of efficacy or if the harms were considered to outweigh any benefits". The ultimate decision "should be based on shared decision-making with the patient" and, for youth, "the parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care".

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1143zxuM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What others are saying

A collaborative statement on current chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) research needs, published by the ATS and the European Respiratory Society, positions pretreatment in pursuit of smoking reduction as a potential mechanism for reducing COPD respiratory symptoms but does not address the potential role of pretreatment for all patients with COPD who continue to smoke. The ATS research statement on smoking-cessation interventions in lung cancer screening programs identified the profound drop-off in intervention rates after assessment of quit readiness as a potential point for performance improvement but did not make specific pretreatment recommendations. The Canadian Cancer Society produced an educational flyer encouraging agency among smokers not ready to quit. It offers advice for preparing for a quit attempt but does not address the role of pharmacotherapy.

Research needs

Given the cumulative effect of varenicline on abstinence during the treatment phase, guidance regarding the optimal duration of treatment, including methods for determining when continuation is unlikely to derive further benefit, is critical to maximizing impact on outcomes. Future research needs to measure outcomes important to patients, such as QOL and other substance use, when conducting trials on patients who are unready to quit. In addition, given the identified synergistic effect of nicotine on varenicline, studies evaluating the impact of combination pharmacotherapy on treatment outcomes are warranted. Finally, research on subgroup populations with comorbidities should be considered. For example, should patients with COPD who continue to smoke receive longer-duration treatment, given their recognized dependence severity? Would patients with a history of depression or alcoholism benefit from combination pretreatment with bupropion? Does the pharmacotherapy follow-up interval after initiation have an impact on efficacy?

Question 6: In Tobacco-Dependent Adults with Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions, Including Substance-Use Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, and/or Bipolar Disorder, for Whom Treatment Is Being Initiated, Should Clinicians Start with the Optimal Controller Identified for Patients without Psychiatric Conditions or Use a Nicotine Patch?

Rationale for question

Before the publication of the EAGLES clinical trial, there was a boxed warning regarding possible neuropsychiatric adverse events for both varenicline and bupropion. These concerns stemmed from case reports and postmarketing surveillance, as no RCTs found evidence for these events and early observations suggested no significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events with pharmacotherapy compared with placebo, even among patients with preexisting mental illness. Given the persistent stigma assigned to varenicline within the behavioral health community, the panel believed it important to evaluate the evidence guiding the clinical question of whether varenicline or nicotine should be used in adults with comorbid psychiatric conditions.

### Combining antidepressants in acute depression… [^116U1dqk]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of RCTs comparing combinations of antidepressants with antidepressant monotherapy, combining antidepressants was associated with superior treatment outcomes but not with more patients dropping out of treatment. Combinations using an antagonist of presynaptic α2-autoreceptors may be preferable and may be applied as a first-line treatment in severe cases of depression and for patients considered nonresponders. In a previous meta-analysis, 9 we showed that, compared with monotherapy, combination therapy is more effective and comparably tolerable as a treatment for acute depression, most notably when applied as a first-line treatment. We also found that this was particularly the case for combinations that include monoamine reuptake inhibitors and antagonists of presynaptic α2-autoreceptors.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing combinations of 2 antidepressants with antidepressant monotherapy in adults with acute depression addresses a number of questions. What is the efficacy of combination therapy, relative to monotherapy, both as first-line treatment and as treatment for nonresponders. Are combination treatments that include mirtazapine or bupropion particularly effective. What is the comparative tolerability of combination therapies. This study yielded 2 main results. First, combination treatment as a general principle seems to be more effective than monotherapy without being associated with higher numbers of patients dropping out. Second, the combination of monoamine reuptake inhibitors and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists seems to be the most effective and preferable antidepressant combination.

The relative tolerability of combination therapy and the modest response rates with initial antidepressant monotherapy also suggest considering RI+α2 combination therapy as a first-line treatment, at least in severe cases of depression. On the whole, in our analysis, treatment effects of antidepressant combinations were not associated with baseline severity. According to these results, combination treatment is effective regardless of initial illness severity. Nevertheless, this finding must be viewed as preliminary because it rests on a subset of studies and only on outcomes ascertained by HDRS.

Study selection

The review included all randomized controlled trials that compared (1) psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy against treatment as usual (TAU), placebo, waiting list (WL) or other control group: (2) psychotherapy against pharmacotherapy; or (3) the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy against either one. Psychotherapy was defined by the American Psychiatric Association as 'the informed and intentional application of clinical methods and interpersonal stances derived from established psychological principles for the purpose of assisting people to modify their behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and/or other personal characteristics in directions that the participants deem desirable' (Norcross). More specifically, different psychotherapeutic approaches were defined according to definition previously developed in comparative meta-analyses (Cuijpers et al.). All studies had to report at least one validated outcome measure assessing functioning (any difficulty experienced in maintaining daily activities or participation in social life (Lam et al.) or QoL (one's satisfaction with these activities and perception of his/her health (World Health Organization Quality of Life Group; IsHak et al.). Information on symptom severity was extracted only from validated instruments that explicitly measured symptoms of depression [e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD; Hamilton,)]. The diagnosis of depression had to be established by a standardized diagnostic interview according to ICD or DSM criteria (APA; WHO). Studies including bipolar or schizoaffective disorder or reporting results from maintenance or continuation therapies were excluded. The abstract screening was done by one researcher (K.K.) and a random selection of 20% of the abstracts was double-checked independently by another two researchers (M.C. and C.T.).

### Can monoamine-based therapies be improved? [^114aHLHi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Monoamine-based therapies that selectively target serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine uptake are effective as antidepressants. However, many depressed patients do not achieve remission with these single-action agents. Treatment strategies that target more than one neurotransmitter, either through augmentation, combination treatment, or the development of single agents with dual or triple reuptake mechanisms, may prove to be even more effective than traditional antidepressants and merit further research.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117VTy5M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 12%. MDD imposes a substantial burden of illness and is the leading cause of disability internationally. The most common treatments for MDD are broadly classified as pharmacological or psychological, with a multitude of different treatments from each category available.

A significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatment(s) and are considered 'treatment resistant'. Although there is no universally accepted definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the most frequently used criterion is the failure to respond to two trials of pharmacological therapy of adequate dose and duration, in the current episode. Less commonly, failure of psychological therapies is also considered to contribute towards the definition of treatment resistance. The most widely used staging model of TRD is the Thase and Rush model. In this model, failure to respond to one adequate antidepressant trial from a major antidepressant class is considered Stage I TRD, and those who then do not respond to a second adequate antidepressant trial (from a different class than the antidepressant used in Stage I) are termed Stage II TRD. There are variations between measures, studies and groups in terms of requiring a second antidepressant to be from a different class, however. It has been suggested that permitting two 'failed' treatments from within a class, and permitting psychological treatments, should be incorporated in updated definitions of Stage II TRD.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression [^113YhoKn]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various effective treatments for depression exist. We aimed to identify the most effective first-line treatments for new episodes of less and more severe depression (defined by depression scale cut-off scores), to update NICE guidance on the management of Depression in Adults in England.

Methods

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2020 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019151328). We analysed interventions by class and individually. The primary efficacy outcome was depressive symptom change (expressed as standardised mean difference [SMD]). The review for this outcome was updated in November 2023.

Findings

We included 676 RCTs, 105,477 participants and 63 treatment classes. For less severe depression, group cognitive/cognitive behavioural therapy (CT/CBT) class was efficacious versus treatment as usual [TAU], the reference treatment for this population [SMD −1.01 (95% Credible Interval [CrI] −1.76; −0.06)]. For more severe depression, efficacious classes versus pill placebo (reference treatment for this population) included combined individual CT/CBT with antidepressants [−1.18 (−2.07; −0.44)], individual behavioural therapies [−0.86 (−1.65; −0.16)], combined light therapy with antidepressants [−0.86 (−1.59; −0.12)], combined acupuncture with antidepressants [−0.78 (−1.12; −0.44)], individual CT/CBT [−0.78 (−1.42; −0.33)], mirtazapine [−0.35 (−0.48; −0.22)], serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [−0.32 (−0.43; −0.22)], tricyclic antidepressants [−0.29 (−0.50; −0.05)], and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [−0.24 (−0.32; −0.16)]. Additional treatments showed evidence of efficacy at the intervention level. Evidence for less and more severe depression was of low and low-to-moderate quality, respectively. In the 2023 update, group yoga and self-help without support emerged as efficacious for less severe depression. For more severe depression, combined group exercise with antidepressants emerged as efficacious, whereas combined light therapy with antidepressants failed to remain efficacious.

Interpretation

Group CT/CBT (and possibly group yoga and self-help) appears efficacious in less severe depression, whereas antidepressants do not show evidence of effect. Combined antidepressants with individual CT/CBT, acupuncture and, possibly, group exercise, individual psychological therapies (behavioural therapies, CT/CBT) alone, and antidepressants alone appear efficacious in more severe depression. Quality of evidence, cost-effectiveness, applicability and implementation issues also need to be considered when formulating clinical practice recommendations.

### Combining psychotherapy and antidepressants in the treatment of depression [^1141tK9K]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of antidepressants with that of antidepressants plus psychotherapy ("combined therapy") in the treatment of depression.

Methods

6 month randomised clinical trial of antidepressants (N = 84) and combined therapy (N = 83) in ambulatory patients with Major Depression and a 17-item HDRS baseline score of at least 14 points. The antidepressant protocol provides for three successive steps in case of intolerance or inefficacy: fluoxetine, amitriptyline and moclobemide. The combined therapy condition consists, in addition to pharmacotherapy, of 16 sessions of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy. Efficacy is assessed using the 17-item HDRS, the CGI of Severity and of Improvement, the depression subscale of the SCL-90, and the Quality of Life Depression Scale. The data analysis is conducted on three samples: the intention-to-treat sample, the per protocol sample and the observed cases sample.

Results

After randomisation, 32% of the patients refused the proposed pharmacotherapy while 13% refused the proposed combined therapy. In 24 weeks, 40% of the patients who started with the pharmacotherapy stopped medication; 22% of those receiving the combined therapy did so. The difference in success rates is statistically significant, favouring combined therapy, in 23%, 31% and 62% of the patients after 8, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. At week 24, the mean success rate is 40.7% in the pharmacotherapy group and 59.2% in the combined therapy group.

Conclusion

Patients found combined treatment significantly more acceptable, they were significantly less likely to drop out of combined therapy and, ultimately, significantly more likely to recover. Combined therapy is preferable to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ambulatory patients with major depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111tKVfj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment (augmentation/combination) is recommended for the ~50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

Methods:

We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

Results:

In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9 weeks (range 5 days to 18 months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73) and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a not inconsiderable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's (aripiprazole, (es)ketamine, mirtazapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). We report marked heterogeneity between studies for almost all analyses.

Conclusions:

Our findings support cautious optimism for several augmentation strategies; although considering the high prevalence of TRD, evidence remains inadequate for each treatment option.

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^115yCSR9]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The results from the meta-regression analysis suggest that functioning and QoL improve when symptom severity improves, but which is the leading factor is still unknown. Previous research suggests that functional recovery appears later than the symptomatic one and certain level of impairment continues even after the symptomatology is ameliorated, and that depressive symptoms and QoL do not share high proportion of common variance (Coryell et al; Trompenaars et al.). The residual functional impairment has been found to evoke relapse and recurrences (Vittengl et al.); therefore functioning and QoL should be directly targeted in the response and remission criteria for a more comprehensive assessment of treatment efficacy. There are already steps in this direction. Individual Burden of Illness Index for depression was created to measure treatment impact and recovery in depression by incorporating symptom severity, functioning, and QoL outcomes (Cohen et al.). Zimmerman et al. validated the Remission from Depression Questionnaire, including different domains of functioning and QoL along with symptomatology. However, all attempts for implementation of such criteria are still in their infancy and future research is warranted.

The present meta-analysis demonstrates that the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is significantly better than any of the treatments alone for both functioning and QoL. The number of studies comparing treatments for QoL was limited, but still our result has an important clinical implication for primary and secondary mental health professionals when choosing their treatment lines. Recent data showing the trends in treatment of depression report decrease in the use of combined treatment and psychotherapy and a substantial increase in the prescription of antidepressants (Gemmill et al; Marcus & Olfson). This might be driven by various factors such as availability of resources in terms of money and personnel. However, a recent analysis by Sado et al. shows that combined therapy for depression appears to be cost-effective from health-care system and social perspective. More cost effectiveness and comparative long-term data on combined treatment is needed (McAllister-Williams).

American College of Physicians guideline — comparative benefits and harms for moderate to severe MDD report that moderate-certainty evidence showed there were probably no differences in treatment response, remission rates, and improvement in functional capacity between monotherapy with CBT or SGAs after 8 to 16 weeks, and low-certainty evidence showed there may have been no differences between combination therapy with CBT and SGAs versus SGA monotherapy at 12 weeks; evidence was insufficient about differences in overall serious adverse events between SGA monotherapy and CBT alone or in combination with an SGA, although specific types of adverse events differed among treatments, and compared with SGA monotherapy, discontinuation due to adverse events may have been lower with CBT monotherapy (absolute risk difference, 54 fewer events per 1000 patients) with no differences for combination therapy with CBT and an SGA.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113ZSPrx]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Prevention of recurrence–MDD in older adult patients with a history of depression — recommended and conditional options: For older adult patients with a history of depression, the panel recommends clinicians offer either combination interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and pharmacotherapy, and while the study on which this is based used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects; if the prior options are not acceptable or available, the panel suggests considering interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) alone. Based on the literature reviewed that met the IOM or AMSTAR requirements, comparative effectiveness research demonstrated sufficient evidence for the panel to recommend some combinations of treatments over others due to differences in treatment effect for prevention of recurrence, other treatment/combinations of treatments were equally recommended by the panel based on comparative effectiveness research evidence demonstrating no difference in effect for prevention of recurrence, and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11186Vq3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions on comparative effectiveness and harms in major depressive disorder (MDD) specify: for adults attempting initial treatment, the effectiveness of SGA monotherapy compared with nonpharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy (Key Question 1a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (1b); for adults who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with 1 SGA, the comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies (2a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (2b); the comparative risks for harms for those attempting initial treatment or those who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with an SGA (3a) and whether comparative risks vary by MDD severity (3b); and whether benefits and risks differ by subgroups defined by psychiatric symptoms or demographics (4). The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment according to MDD severity because screening is becoming more widespread and may increase diagnosis of milder MDD.

How the APA clinical practice guideline compares to other clinical practice guidelines for treatment of depression — this section notes that various other organizations' guidelines are now considered to be outdated and highlights guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute, the Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The American Psychiatric Association's last guideline on depression focused on major depressive disorder in adults and is now listed as outdated; its main recommendations include overall psychiatric management. For patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder, antidepressant medication or psychotherapy were recommended as initial treatments; for moderate to severe major depressive disorder, a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy was recommended; and for severe major depressive disorder that was not responding to medication or psychotherapy or with associated catatonic or psychotic features, electroconvulsive therapy was recommended. The recommendations also included monitoring during the continuation phase of treatment, a maintenance phase of treatment, tapering of medication during the discontinuation phase, and consideration of psychiatric factors, psychosocial and demographic factors, and other co-occurring medical conditions. Like the American Psychiatric Association's guideline, the present American Psychological Association's guideline also includes recommendations for psychotherapy and for antidepressant medication; however, it more commonly recommends combinations of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication versus antidepressant medication alone and does not detail recommendations for the various stages of treatment.

### Neurobiology of depression and mechanism of action of depression treatments [^115k7mn9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may alleviate depressive symptoms but also leave residual symptoms. The mechanism of action of SSRIs increases serotonin (5-HT) activity but decreases norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) activity. By engaging additional targets (eg, NE, DA) along with 5-HT, clinicians may help patients with residual symptoms and treatment-resistant depression. Dual-acting agents and combination strategies can be used to target specific symptoms or block/activate specific receptors for broader therapeutic benefits. Clinicians who understand the mechanism of action of antidepressants can switch or combine agents as needed to help patients achieve complete remission.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided versus unguided antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder: new insights from subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses [^116FMRYW]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest and emotional and physical symptoms that severely impact daily functioning, affecting one out of five individuals in their lifetime. The standard of care for MDD involves a combination of evidence-based interventions, primarily pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression and in preventing relapse. Pharmacotherapy is essential for moderate-to-severe cases, offering rapid symptom relief and neurochemical balance. It typically begins with first-line antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, due to their broad efficacy and favourable side-effect profiles. For patients who do not respond to initial therapy or who have specific clinical indications, alternatives such as tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and atypical antidepressants may be considered. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants, substantial variability in treatment response remains, with 30%–40% of patients failing to achieve adequate response or remission, partly due to genetic differences impacting drug efficacy and side effects. This variability, coupled with a trial-and-error approach to prescribing, can result in delayed relief, prolonged suffering and an elevated suicide risk. These challenges highlight the urgent need for more precise, personalised treatment strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with MDD.

Antidepressant efficacy: a review of current standards and challenges

How effective are antidepressants in treating patients with MDD? Data from STAR*D — the largest comparison trial, to date, of antidepressant effectiveness among agents from different classes — support the use of antidepressants in patients with MDD, as there was a cumulative 67% response rate after all four steps of the study. Furthermore, in an analysis that was independent of the STAR*D data set, Gibbons et al. found an estimated response rate of 58.4% (versus 39.9% for placebo) to antidepressants. Indeed, antidepressants can be helpful to many patients.

However, antidepressant monotherapy alone may not always be enough to treat depression. Towards this end, augmentation strategies with other classes of medications can be a useful option. For example, a meta-analysis of antipsychotic efficacy in 16 trials (n = 3480) found that adjunctive atypical antipsychotics significantly outperformed placebo as treatment strategies for depression response and remission (though their use is associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events). Quetiapine and aripiprazole are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive therapies for the treatment of depression, while olanzapine/fluoxetine combination therapy is approved for patients with treatment-resistant depression (as per the FDA definition ⩾2 failed treatments). Furthermore, ziprasidone was recently found to significantly outperform placebo in patients with depression (n = 139) with regard to reductions in depression scores (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Similarly, 8-week adjunctive use of the atypical antipsychotic cariprazine 2–4.5 mg per day (n = 276) was effective for treating depression in patients with refractory disease compared with cariprazine 1–2 mg per day (n = 274) or placebo (n = 269). Drug tolerability was favorable, adding to its potential promise for treatment-resistant depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^117GpUSo]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child and adolescent depression — American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidance recommends case management, support, and psychoeducation for brief or uncomplicated depression; recommends either interpersonal psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for moderate depression; and states that for severe depression antidepressant medication is also recommended alone until the child can begin psychotherapy or in combination with psychotherapy from the start, with combination therapy recommended for children that do not respond to monotherapy. The American Psychological Association notes caution with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and suggests combination of treatment may be warranted with more severe clinical presentations, yet its guideline does not address combination treatment of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication for children/adolescents. In the Treatment of Adolescent Depression trial, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was compared as a stand-alone intervention to fluoxetine, to the combination of CBT and medication, and to placebo across 13 sites and over 400 adolescents, and the study concluded that combination treatment of fluoxetine and CBT resulted in significantly better outcomes than CBT or fluoxetine alone. Despite these data, the panel did not find these studies to yet warrant recommendations regarding combined treatment for children and adolescents and desires more comparative effectiveness and combined treatment research.

### Managing major depressive disorder through the use of adjunct therapies [^114FaFMi]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Although many treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) exist, only half of all patients respond to initial trial of pharmacotherapy and only a third will achieve remission with that trial. First-line therapies for the management of MDD include psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, alone or in combination. Given the disappointing rates of response and remission to initial therapy, clinicians are looking for methods to improve the management of MDD, such as through the use of adjunct therapies. The first article in this series, by Katzman and Chokka, discusses gaps in the treatment of MDD and proposes measures to change and strengthen future practice guidelines. Epstein et al. summarize the findings of clinical studies, systematic analyses, and reviews of trials supporting the use of adjunct therapy for the treatment of MDD. Velehorschi et al. review emerging research identifying common pathophysiological processes between MDD and three of its comorbidities. Lastly, Cameron and Habert highlight the challenges that primary care physicians face in the management of MDD. Ultimately, the goal of treatment is to not only relieve symptoms of MDD, but achieve sustained remission. This supplement was written to address the issues of less than ideal outcomes and approaches to enhancing response and remission rates.

The American Psychological Association (APA) developed this clinical practice guideline to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders, including major depression, subsyndromal depression, and persistent depressive disorder. It addresses three developmental cohorts: adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other literature and observations from practitioners and patients, served as the basis for the guideline. The guideline development panel consisted of health professionals from psychology, psychiatry, and family medicine as well as community members who self-identified as having had depression. The panel examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and of complementary and alternative medicine treatments. It also examined comparative effectiveness among psychological treatments, by themselves and in combination with pharmacotherapy, and comparative effectiveness of psychological treatments in relation to pharmacotherapy and to complementary and alternative treatments. The panel made recommendations for treatment of depression in adolescents, adults, and older adults but did not make treatment recommendations specific to children. These recommendations, presented in detail in the guideline, are summarized here. The target audience for the guideline includes clinicians, researchers, patients, family members, and policymakers.

### Major depressive disorder: understanding the significance of residual symptoms and balancing efficacy with tolerability [^112GrDhr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is a complex and frequent psychiatric condition that poses significant challenges to both the patients who experience it and the physicians who treat them. The goal of therapy is for patients to achieve remission, which requires identifying and measuring symptoms at the outset and throughout treatment to document both response and resistance to treatment. A number of validated instruments are available both for diagnosis of and response to treatment. Many factors affect a patient's ability to achieve remission, but although many patients do achieve remission, a significant number continue to have residual symptoms that cause functional impairment.

Methods

Review of the literature for treatment of major depression, including mechanisms of action, individualized treatment optimization, residual symptom reduction, and minimization of side effects.

Results

For sustained remission, all symptoms must be treated until they are undetectable. Patients who do not achieve remission after adequate treatment trials should be evaluated for adherence to treatment, as well as comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders. In these cases, consideration should be given to changing therapy by switching, combining, or augmenting initial therapy, as well as referring some patients to a psychiatrist for treatment with specialized modalities. Linking symptoms with malfunctioning brain circuits and neurotransmitters provides a targeted approach for achieving sustained remission. Neurobiology also provides a rational basis for combination therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression, because it can aid selection of different drugs with different mechanisms of action or of multifunctional/multimodal antidepressant drugs that target more than 1 molecular mechanism.

Discussion

Recent advances and better understanding of neurobiology provide a rational basis for individualizing treatment of patients with major depression.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^113nRYr1]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians face another challenge because, after several weeks of the first-line treatment, only 50% of patients respond (i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at pre-treatment), and only 30% remit (i.e. return to a euthymic state). Patients' failure to respond or remit requires consideration of alternative treatments. Guideline recommendations for second-line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant or adding a different drug. The last strategy may be divided into 'augmentation' when a non-antidepressant drug is added to an antidepressant and 'combination' when two antidepressants are used together. Systematic reviews of RCTs agree that dose escalation confers no benefit beyond continuing the initial drug dose; consistent with these results, the German National Guideline clearly states that dose escalation for SSRI does not work. Two previous systematic reviews have found some support for the switching strategy, especially to an antidepressant from a different class. However, a recent more rigorous meta-analysis found no high-level evidence that switching the antidepressant is effective when compared to simply continuing the initial antidepressant. There are also reviews that support various augmentation strategies and combination strategies. However, most of the RCTs addressing patients who fail to respond to initial pharmacotherapy for depression compared new strategies against continuing preceding treatment; far less evidence exists comparing alternative second-line strategies against one another. For example, only two reports have directly compared switching vs combination strategies among patients who failed first-line treatment: one study compared combination vs switching vs continuing the prior treatment, while another compared dose escalation vs combination vs continuing the prior treatment. Unfortunately, neither study was sufficiently powered (only 32–38 patients in each arm in the first study and 98–99 patients in the second study) to reach meaningful conclusions. The STAR*D trial randomised 1439 patients with major depression who had not remitted on citalopram to various switching strategies or augmentation/combination strategies. However, they used an equipoise-stratified design which gave patients choices in their treatment regimen: only 105 patients consented to randomisation to any of the drug switching or augmentation strategies, and consequently the analyses had to be conducted separately among the switching strategies or among the augmentation/combination strategies. A recently published study compared switching to bupropion against combining with bupropion or augmenting with an antipsychotic aripiprazole among 1522 patients with antidepressant-refractory major depression and found that aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased response over bupropion combination or switching. Most patients in this trial were, however, chronically depressed and highly refractory (the mean duration of index episode was more than 85 months and the mean number of previous medication courses was 2.4). The trial does not, therefore, address the initial treatment of a new depressive episode.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment. This article will review available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### Are antipsychotics or antidepressants needed for psychotic depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy with combination treatment [^112RLeei]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a meta-analysis of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy for psychotic depression.

Data Sources

We performed an electronic search (from inception of databases until February 28, 2011) in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, without language or time restrictions. Search terms were (psychosis OR psychotic OR hallucinations OR hallucinating OR delusions OR delusional) AND (depression OR depressed OR major depressive disorder) AND (random OR randomized OR randomly).

Study Selection

Eight randomized, placebo-controlled acute-phase studies in adults (N = 762) with standardized criteria-defined psychotic depression (including Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-IV, or ICD-10) were meta-analyzed, yielding 10 comparisons. Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was compared in 5 trials with 6 treatment arms (n = 337) with antidepressant monotherapy and in 4 trials with 4 treatment arms (n = 447) with antipsychotic monotherapy.

Data Extraction

Primary outcome was study-defined inefficacy; secondary outcomes included all-cause discontinuation, specific psychopathology ratings, and side effects. Using random effects models, we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), number-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/NNH), and effect size (ES).

Results

Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment outperformed antidepressant monotherapy regarding less study-defined inefficacy (no. of comparisons = 6; n = 378; RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98; P = 0.03; heterogeneity [I2] = 34%) (NNT = 7; 95% CI, 4–20; P = 0.009) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 289; ES = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.02; P = 0.03; I2 = 0%), with trend-level superiority for depression ratings (no. of comparisons = 5; n = 324; ES = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.44 to 0.03; P = 0.09; I2 = 10%), but not regarding psychosis ratings (no. of comparisons = 3; n = 161; ES = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.85 to 0.38; P = 0.45; I2 = 70%). Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment also outperformed antipsychotic monotherapy regarding less study-defined inefficacy (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 447; RR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63–0.84; P < .0001; I2 = 0%) (NNT = 5; 95% CI, 4–8; P < .0001) and depression ratings (no. of comparisons = 4; n = 428; ES = -0.49; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.23; P = 0.0002; I2 = 27%), while anxiety (P = 0.11) and psychosis (P = 0.06) ratings only trended toward favoring cotreatment. All-cause discontinuation and reported side-effect rates were similar, except for more somnolence with antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressants (P = 0.02). Only 1 open-label, 4-month extension study (n = 59) assessed maintenance/relapse-prevention efficacy of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant monotherapy, without group differences.

Conclusions

Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was superior to monotherapy with either drug class in the acute treatment of psychotic depression. These results support recent treatment guidelines, but more studies are needed to assess specific combinations and maintenance/relapse-prevention efficacy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^115yhizH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Combination interventions

With the exception of OFC, each treatment combination (i.e. two intervention/controls initiated simultaneously) had only been assessed in one study per combination and with wide ranging ESs (presented in). We conclude that, given the methodological differences between these, no conclusions can at present be made about specific combinations from RCTs of people with early-stage TRD.

Secondary outcomes

Subgroup analyses

Additional analyses stratifying between early-stage and substantive TRD criteria required for inclusion in each study are presented in. For all treatments studied, ES 95% CI had large overlap when comparing between studies defining TRD as 1 FT and 2 FTs, suggesting treatment efficacy was not sensitive to TRD definition. The exception to this rule was buspirone, for which the ES and 95% CIs were considerably higher when TRD was defined as 2 FTs (1 FT = ES = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61–1.07; 2 FTs = ES = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14–2.02), although this consisted of only one small study.

Additional analyses stratifying treatment ESs by the duration of study treatment are presented in. As previously mentioned, study durations were defined as 'short-term' (< 6 weeks), 'adequate duration' (6–12 weeks) and 'long-term' (> 12 weeks). Perhaps surprisingly, subgroups of 'short-term' and 'adequate duration' studies did not result in any consistent findings concerning treatment efficacy. Although approximately half of the treatments studied in this subgroup analysis saw an ES increase when focussing on those studied at an 'adequate' duration, half did not. Moreover, 95% CIs and I 2 statistics demonstrated considerable overlap and high heterogeneity, respectively.

Tolerability and acceptability

Tolerability data were recorded by 79% of included studies (k = 91). The specific measures used were too heterogeneous to allow for meaningful comparison. Data on acceptability were available for 84% of studies (k = 97). The most commonly used measure to assess tolerability was dropout due to any cause, which was reported in 28% of active treatment patients, compared to 12% of those receiving placebo.

Dropouts due to adverse events were recorded in 23 articles, returning a dropout rate approximately twice as high in active treatment conditions compared to placebo (9.2% vs 4%). Other, less commonly used, measures included treatment-emergent adverse events, dropout due to intolerance and mean retention time in weeks.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^11454yng]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA guideline — initial treatment for major depressive disorder in older adult patients: The panel recommends, in the context of shared decision-making, either group life review treatment or Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (either alone or added to usual care) over no treatment, and combined pharmacotherapy and IPT over IPT alone; although the study used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Strength of recommendation: Recommendation for use. Justification notes that cognitive-behavioural therapy (group) and life review (group) were the only interventions with adequate efficacy evidence; comparative effectiveness research either finds sufficient evidence to recommend between some treatment comparisons or finds similar effects between treatments; and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy, generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline; there is some efficacy data from systematic reviews/meta-analyses showing efficacy of second-generation antidepressants over placebo. Older adults were defined as ages 60 and over, with at least one study including some individuals as young as 50; however, the majority were ages 60 and over.

Major depressive disorder — SGA versus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): For monotherapy, moderate-quality evidence from 5 trials showed no difference in response between SGAs and CBT in patients with MDD after 8 to 52 weeks of treatment, and low-quality evidence from 3 trials showed no difference between remission rates and functional capacity for SGAs compared with CBT. For combination therapy, low-quality evidence from 2 trials showed no difference in response or remission when comparing SGA monotherapy with SGAs plus CBT after 12 to 52 weeks of treatment; functional results were mixed, with one trial finding that combination therapy patients reported more improvement on 3 of 5 work-functioning measures than SGA monotherapy, although clinically important differences were uncertain.

### Issues in treatment-resistant depression [^11129XY9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease that imposes significant social and economic burdens not only on patients but also on society. Although various treatment options are available, treatment-resistant depression is common. Determining the exact prevalence of treatment-resistant depression is difficult because definitions vary, as do definitions of antidepressant response. Operational definitions of antidepressant response, nonresponse, partial response, and remission will be discussed in this article. Pharmacotherapy options for patients with treatment-resistant depression include augmentation, combination, and switching therapies; however, data from controlled clinical trials supporting these therapies are limited. Electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy offer additional treatment strategies. New nonpharmacologic therapies are under investigation. Remission is the goal of treatment.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^114V68As]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult patients with depression — conditional recommendation for use: If a recommended treatment is not acceptable or available, the panel suggests that clinicians offer one of the following psychotherapies/interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment or treatment as usual. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (individual) (either standalone or in combination with usual care) was found to be superior to no treatment, a nonspecific talk therapy control, usual care, and desipramine. Combination cognitive-behavioral therapy and nonspecific therapeutic techniques (individual) with pharmacotherapy was superior to pharmacotherapy alone, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was conditionally superior for preventing recurrence to supportive care or to IPT and supportive care, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Problem-solving therapy (group) was superior to reminiscence therapy (group), and interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) was superior to supportive care. The rationale states that the panel suggests the use of interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment (i.e., waitlist) or treatment as usual, notes that nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression, is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline, and that there is some efficacy data from systematic reviews/meta-analyses showing efficacy of second-generation antidepressants over placebo.

### Effective treatment of bipolar depression: monotherapy and combination strategies [^115dE17W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Managing patients with bipolar disorder remains a challenge due to its chronic nature. In addition, bipolar depression remains understudied even though patients spend more time in depressive episodes than in manic ones. Effective treatment requires an accurate and timely diagnosis, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and implementation of elements of the chronic care model. Pharmacologic strategies for treating bipolar depression differ from those for bipolar mania as well as those for unipolar depression and require knowledge of the efficacy and safety of agents including mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants both as monotherapy and in combination.

For combination therapy, low-quality evidence from 1 trial showed no difference in functional capacity for SGA monotherapy compared with SGA plus psychodynamic combination therapy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111du1U9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

By using a more inclusive definition of early-stage TRD (non-response to one adequate course of antidepressant monotherapy), in addition to including psychological and combination treatments, we hope to strengthen the pooled evidence with a substantially greater number of studies and participants than previous meta-analyses of this topic.

The study aims to assess the impact of treatment intervention for patients with early-stage TRD. The objectives were to evaluate treatment improvement in depression, alongside acceptability and tolerability using pre-post treatment effects. Using pre-post effect meta-analyses, we were able to compare effectiveness estimates for heterogeneous treatment strategies and did not require a common comparator (e.g. placebo arm). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that pre-post ESs can estimate the magnitude of treatment effects appropriately, reflecting naturalistic clinical outcomes more closely and also take into account non-specific clinical effects.

### Psychological treatment of depression in primary care: recent developments [^112z4mYg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, disabling, and costly disorders that are linked with considerably diminished role functioning and quality of life, medical comorbidity, and mortality. In the past decades, considerable progress has been made in the research and development of treatments of depression in several settings, including primary care. Many different types of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy are now available that have shown to be effective in multiple randomized trials. Based on these significant and positive effects, many of these treatments are included in treatment guidelines and are widely used across clinical practice.

The majority of depressed patients are treated in primary care and only a small proportion of these are referred to mental health services. Despite the hundreds of randomized trials on drugs and therapy, only a limited number of these trials on drugs and therapy have focused on primary care patients. The results found for treatments in specialized mental health care may, however, not be valid in depressed primary care patients, also because depression is assumed to be less severe in primary care patients.

Although both antidepressant medication and psychotherapies have small, but positive effects on depression, with no clinically relevant differences at the short-term, many general practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe antidepressant medications to depressed patients. The majority of patients, however, prefer psychological treatments. In a systematic review of 34 studies among different settings, it was found that on average 75% of patients with mental disorders preferred psychotherapy over drug treatment, especially in younger patients, although there are indications that this may be related to severity of depression with more severe patients more often preferring drugs.

In this paper, we will give an overview of the available psychological treatments that have been tested in randomized trials in primary care patients. We will also examine the relative effects of therapies, antidepressants, and their combination. We will summarize what is known about how these therapies can be delivered (individually, in groups, by telephone, through the internet) and who can deliver them. Then we will focus on new developments in the field, including the use of therapies that are delivered through new technologies, the increasing number of trials on psychotherapy in primary settings in low and middle income countries (LMICs), the recent evidence that simple forms of therapy are as effective as more complicated forms, that treating subthreshold depression can have important preventive effects, and that there is increasing knowledge about the treatment of specific target groups, such as older adults, women with postpartum depression, comorbid substance use, and comorbid general medical disorders.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116h2m7R]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence.

Audience and Patient Population

The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD.

Recommendation 1a

ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 1b

ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant:

- Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
- Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Translating clinical science into effective therapies [^1129UceC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Identifying a patient with treatment-resistant depression involves ensuring that at least 2 evidence-based antidepressant trials from two different pharmacologic classes have been undertaken and determining their impact on patients' symptoms, functioning, quality-of-life and social relationships as outcomes. When assessing depressive symptoms throughout the course of treatment, clinical judgment should be supplemented by using standardized tools such as the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). Adjunctive treatment strategies preserve the benefits of first-line antidepressants in partial responders and potentially enhance the initial antidepressant's effect through complementary mechanisms of action. Novel "multimodal" pharmacotherapies with diverse potentially beneficial mechanisms of action are in development, which have varying degrees of activity across multiple monoamine systems including those regulated by serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate.

Changes since protocol registration

It was originally planned for data from all included studies to be extracted independently by paired authors and then discrepancies assessed. However, considering the large number of included studies, the protocol was amended so that data were extracted by one author, and then independently reviewed for accuracy by a second author. This was decided in order to complete the review in a timely manner, so that the findings accurately reflected the current evidence base. For this reason, pairwise meta-analyses were also not undertaken. Due to the increased heterogeneity in previous analyses of class- and modality-level analyses (see), these were not undertaken. Due to the number of studies and extent of heterogeneity between included study methodologies, the planned subgroups of depression severity, comorbidities, episode duration, continuation treatments and treatment setting were not ultimately considered in analyses.

### Pharmacologic treatment of depression [^116e1CYw]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of depression and the use of antidepressant medications have risen steadily in the United States over the past three decades. Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age. Second-generation antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators, atypical antidepressants) are first-line therapy for depression. Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavior therapy and other types of individual and group therapy, is also a first-line treatment. The combination of medication and psychotherapy is preferred for severe depression. Treatment history, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered when choosing an antidepressant medication. Although many patients use antidepressants indefinitely, few studies have examined safety and effectiveness beyond two years. There is an increased risk of relapse or recurrence of depressive symptoms when an antidepressant is discontinued, compared with continued use. Gradually tapering the dosage while concurrently providing cognitive behavior therapy can decrease this risk. High-quality evidence on antidepressant use in pregnancy is lacking. Depression and use of antidepressants are both associated with preterm birth.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112whxWW]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of depression — research and funding needs emphasizes developing innovative ways to match patients with treatments and states that studies should examine the efficacy of a step-wise approach like switching patients from medication to types of psychotherapies (or vice versa) in cases of treatment failure, with the goal to better understand how to make the treatment more effective for all persons or to better understand for which individuals the treatment is not recommended. The page notes that, given the complexity and large resource needs of randomized clinical trials, available high-quality research is limited, that funding is highly competitive and thus available to a relatively small number of investigators, and that addressing the many questions raised will require more investment in complex and expensive research across many investigative teams, including much larger sample sizes for key questions about moderators and mediators of treatment response than are typical of current psychotherapy research studies.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) comparators describe that second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) were compared with monotherapy that involved nonpharmacologic interventions or with combination therapies of SGAs and nonpharmacologic interventions; for second-line treatment, modifications of initial treatment with SGAs were compared with nonpharmacologic interventions; other pharmacologic interventions, including CAM; or combinations of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies as either switches to new treatment or augmentation of existing therapy.

### Is combination olanzapine and antidepressant medication associated with a more rapid response trajectory than antidepressant alone? [^114GuY3Y]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors' goal was to determine if prescription of antidepressant medication plus olanzapine initiates a more rapid response than prescription of antidepressant alone.

Method

Twenty patients with major depression were studied. For 2 weeks the patients were blindly assigned to receive antidepressant plus olanzapine or antidepressant plus placebo. After 2 weeks, olanzapine augmentation was initiated for patients who did not improve with placebo augmentation. Response to medication was measured primarily by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. Other measures were the CORE, Clinical Global Impression, Beck Depression Inventory, and Daily Rating Schedule.

Results

Hamilton depression scores improved nonsignificantly in response to olanzapine combination therapy, but that trend was not evident on any secondary measure. Four patients who did not improve while receiving antidepressant and placebo showed rapid remission following late olanzapine augmentation.

Conclusions

Failure to demonstrate any benefit from initial combination therapy may reflect an underpowered rather than a negative study. The distinct impact of late olanzapine augmentation suggests that pretreatment with an antidepressant may be required to facilitate a rapid antidepressant response to combined treatment.

Introduction

Depression is one of the most devastating human conditions. In the Unites States alone, the economic burden attributed to major depressive disorder (MDD) increased by over 21% from 2005 to 2010; this cost is representative of the combination of direct effects, suicide-related expenditures and workplace costs. Several reasons may explain this sharp uptick in costs in a short period of time: an increase in both the population of the United States as well as in the prevalence of MDD; an increase in the costs of treatments; changes in the composition and quality of treatment services; and changes in the rates of employment and treatment-seeking behaviors. Without a doubt, the discovery of treatments to combat depression is essential.

Though there are several classes of approved antidepressant treatments for depression — including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors — about a third of patients do not respond to these medications. Even when patients do respond to available treatments, the effects often take weeks to months to meet their full potential. Furthermore, treatment-resistant depression (a form of depression that does not respond to one or more antidepressant treatments of adequate dose and duration) is severe and, in some cases, debilitating. For example, 17% of patients with treatment-resistant depression have a prior suicide attempt, underscoring the severe nature of this disease. In addition to lost productivity and poorer quality of life, in the United States alone, it is estimated that treatment-resistant depression costs nearly $50 billion annually. These reasons underscore the critical need for rapid and novel therapies for treatment-resistant depression.

After a brief review of the efficacy of standard antidepressants, we will discuss the status of experimental antidepressant therapeutics. The mechanism by which many of these novel antidepressants are thought to work represents a departure from traditional antidepressants (which may affect their antidepressant actions primarily through the modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission). Specifically, new medications that modulate the glutamatergic system are at the forefront of antidepressant research and development.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies in initial treatment of major depressive disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BKPJD]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Finally, comparative effectiveness at a group level did not detect a difference between second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies, but how best to tailor this information to an individual patient is still not clear, especially given the low strength of evidence for most of the included outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that biomarkers may have a role in predicting response to cognitive behavioral therapy compared with second generation antidepressants, but these findings have yet to be replicated or implemented in clinical practice. Analyses of individual patient level data are best suited to answer that question and should be done in the future. Although we searched for unpublished literature, publication bias and selective outcome reporting may still be potential limiting factors. Finally, because we did not compare active treatment with placebo or no treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that cognitive behavioral therapy and second generation antidepressants may be similarly ineffective. However, because evidence of benefit from both treatments exists, a provider would be unlikely recommend no treatment instead.

Conclusions and policy implications

In clinical decision making, providers should consider not only the efficacy of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions but also patients' preferences about potential adverse events, the costs and availability of each treatment, and expected treatment effects. Currently, the biggest barrier to offering psychotherapy either alone or in combination with drugs may be how well patients can gain access to such mental healthcare clinicians. Given that the benefits of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy do not seem to differ significantly in treating major depressive disorder and that primary care patients may have personal preferences for one first line treatment over the other, both treatments should be made accessible, either alone or in combination, to primary care patients with major depressive disorder.

Having access to psychotherapeutic interventions in the primary care setting might improve treatment outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder. It has the potential to improve use of psychiatric consultations and therapy and to enhance coordination of care between primary care clinicians and mental health professionals. It may also have additional downstream effects of reducing the stigma associated with mental illness in general, empowering patients to tackle the symptoms and problems associated not only with depression but also with other mental health related concerns and encouraging them to seek and maintain treatment more quickly at an earlier stage of their illness.

Potential sources of variability not examined

Although we examined TRD severity as a dichotomous factor for its potential to influence treatment efficacy, we were neither able to look in detail at the different approaches used to assess treatment resistance (e.g.vs Massachusetts General Hospital staging models), nor we categorised studies employing a sequential design or prospective open-label standardised treatment to determine TRD. Relatedly, we did not examine the severity or chronicity of patients' depressive episodes as potential effect modifiers on clinical outcome.

There are several other factors confounders, which could have impacted ESs. These include blinding (and indeed incidences of unblinding), allegiance effects or statistical methods, as well as the extent of the likely efficacy expectation effect, recruitment sources of patients, trial-specific eligibility criteria and generalisability (clinical or demographic) and treatment delivery. It is important to note that these effect modifiers may even differ between treatments (e.g. newer interventions being subject to different methodologies than older interventions). In traditional between-subjects meta-analyses, these factors are largely accounted for, within each study, by the direct group comparisons. Our comparison of within-subjects ES' between treatments does not account for this study-to-study variability directly.
