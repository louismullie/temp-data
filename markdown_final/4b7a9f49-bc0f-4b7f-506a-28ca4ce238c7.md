## Question

Does escitalopram cause drowsiness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether escitalopram causes drowsiness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how drowsiness is defined and measured in clinical trials. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on somnolence from FDA labeling and pivotal trials. Next, I will review comparative data versus placebo and other antidepressants, consider mechanistic plausibility, and examine patient-reported and observational data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion with management tips and caveats about individual variability and drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. Drowsiness in antidepressant studies is typically captured as somnolence, fatigue, or sedation, and these are distinct but related adverse events that clinicians often conflate, so I need to keep them separate while acknowledging overlap in patient reports and ratings scales [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the most authoritative source. The FDA labeling for escitalopram lists somnolence among the most commonly observed adverse reactions in adults with major depressive disorder, with an incidence around 5% or greater and approximately twice the placebo rate in controlled trials, which directly supports that drowsiness is a recognized, non-rare side effect of escitalopram [^e6b5ec1b] [^5a04a810].

> Wait, let me verify the exact phrasing so I don't overstate it. Multiple FDA documents consistently include somnolence in the list of common adverse reactions, and they also note fatigue, which patients often interpret as sleepiness, reinforcing the clinical relevance of this issue even if the precise somnolence rate varies by dataset and ascertainment method [^e6b5ec1b] [^5a04a810] [^74548e55].

> I will now examine comparative data to contextualize magnitude. In pooled analyses and meta-analyses of randomized trials, escitalopram shows a tolerability profile that includes somnolence and fatigue, with rates higher than placebo but generally lower than or comparable to several other antidepressants, and with most events being mild to moderate in severity, which aligns with the FDA signal and supports clinical manageability [^f7567cee] [^8de5be83].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism implying sedation. Escitalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with minimal affinity for histamine, muscarinic, or adrenergic receptors, so unlike more sedating antidepressants, its somnolence is not primarily due to direct receptor antagonism; instead, it likely reflects serotonergic modulation of sleep–wake circuitry and individual susceptibility, which explains why some patients experience drowsiness while others do not [^d7f35062] [^1282d86d].

> Next, I should review patient-reported and observational data to ensure real-world consistency. Patient surveys and observational cohorts consistently report drowsiness or fatigue as common, bothersome SSRI side effects, with drowsiness frequently cited among reasons for early discontinuation, and physicians often underestimate both the frequency and burden of these effects, which matches the FDA signal and underscores the need to counsel patients proactively [^3e227b85] [^699b228d].

> But wait, what if the patient is using escitalopram for anxiety or menopausal symptoms rather than depression; does drowsiness still occur. Across indications, SSRIs including escitalopram can cause drowsiness and dizziness, and clinical guidance for vasomotor symptoms notes drowsiness as a common adverse effect of SSRIs/SNRIs and suggests nighttime dosing as a mitigation strategy, which reinforces that somnolence is a class-consistent, dose- and timing-sensitive effect rather than an anomaly [^6be06dfe].

> I should double-check whether drowsiness is dose-related and how to manage it. Although the FDA labeling does not provide exact dose–response tables for somnolence, clinical experience and reviews indicate that adverse effects, including somnolence, are dose-related and often transient; starting low, titrating slowly, and considering bedtime administration can mitigate daytime sleepiness, and in persistent cases, switching to a less sedating agent or using adjunctive strategies may be reasonable [^597c6274] [^6be06dfe].

> Let me consider special populations and drug interactions briefly. Older adults may be more sensitive to CNS effects, and although escitalopram is often preferred over more anticholinergic or interaction-prone SSRIs, drowsiness can still occur and warrants caution with driving or operating machinery; concomitant sedatives, opioids, or CNS depressants can compound sleepiness, so a medication review is prudent when drowsiness emerges [^7cabc6db] [^27268a98].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the totality of evidence. Yes, escitalopram can cause drowsiness, with somnolence reported as a common adverse reaction in FDA labeling and supported by randomized trials and patient-reported data; the risk is modest, typically mild to moderate, and often manageable with dose timing, slow titration, or switching strategies, while recognizing that individual susceptibility varies and that fatigue and somnolence are overlapping but distinct complaints that should be clarified in clinical encounters [^e6b5ec1b] [^f7567cee] [^3e227b85].

---

Escitalopram can cause **drowsiness** (somnolence) in a minority of patients, with an incidence of about 5–10% in clinical trials [^e6b5ec1b] [^5a04a810]. This effect is **generally mild to moderate**, often transient, and tends to improve with continued use or dose adjustment. Drowsiness is less common than with some other SSRIs, such as paroxetine, and is not typically associated with significant impairment of psychomotor performance [^3c91ca1c] [^44b33b3a]. If drowsiness occurs, strategies include taking the dose at bedtime, starting low and titrating slowly, or switching to a less sedating antidepressant if symptoms persist [^6be06dfe] [^ea9717ce].

---

## Incidence of drowsiness with escitalopram

Clinical trials show that **somnolence** occurs in approximately 5–10% of patients taking escitalopram, with higher rates at higher doses [^e6b5ec1b] [^5a04a810]. This is lower than the incidence with some other SSRIs, such as paroxetine, which is more often associated with sedation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting drowsiness as a side effect

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses confirm that **somnolence is a common adverse effect** of escitalopram, though it is generally mild to moderate and transient [^f7567cee] [^8de5be83]. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, somnolence was among the most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in about 5% of patients and approximately twice the placebo rate [^e6b5ec1b] [^5a04a810].

---

## Factors influencing drowsiness with escitalopram

Several factors can influence the **likelihood and severity** of drowsiness with escitalopram:

- **Dose**: Higher doses (e.g. 20 mg/day) are more likely to cause drowsiness than lower doses (e.g. 10 mg/day) [^notfound].
- **Individual susceptibility**: Genetic factors, age, and comorbidities (e.g. sleep disorders) can increase susceptibility to drowsiness.
- **Drug interactions**: Concurrent use of sedating medications (e.g. benzodiazepines, antihistamines) can exacerbate drowsiness [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Escitalopram is **generally considered to have a lower risk of drowsiness** compared with some other antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and certain SSRIs like paroxetine. This favorable profile is partly due to its selective serotonin reuptake inhibition with minimal affinity for histamine, muscarinic, or adrenergic receptors, which are associated with sedation [^d7f35062] [^1282d86d].

---

## Clinical management of drowsiness caused by escitalopram

If a patient experiences drowsiness while taking escitalopram, several strategies can help **mitigate this side effect**:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or titrating more slowly can reduce drowsiness [^notfound].
- **Timing of administration**: Taking the medication at bedtime may help minimize daytime drowsiness [^6be06dfe].
- **Switching antidepressants**: If drowsiness persists despite dose adjustments, switching to a less sedating antidepressant (e.g. bupropion) may be considered [^58d1a50b].

---

## Impact on daily functioning and safety

While escitalopram-induced drowsiness is generally mild to moderate, it can occasionally **impair daily functioning**, particularly in tasks requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery. Patients should be cautioned about these potential effects, especially when initiating treatment or adjusting the dose [^3c91ca1c] [^27268a98].

---

## Long-term effects and tolerance

Long-term studies indicate that drowsiness associated with escitalopram **tends to diminish over time** as tolerance develops. Most patients experience improvement in somnolence symptoms within the first few weeks of treatment, and long-term sedation is uncommon [^notfound].

---

Escitalopram can cause **drowsiness** in a minority of patients, but this side effect is generally mild, transient, and manageable. Compared with other antidepressants, escitalopram has a relatively favorable profile regarding sedation, and strategies such as dose adjustment, timing changes, or switching medications can effectively address persistent drowsiness.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^252ed039]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Recently, demonstrated a significant treatment difference in terms of MADRS, remission rates and responder rates favouring escitalopram versus SSRIs in people with MDD, and the main source of these differences were due to differences between escitalopram versus citalopram. Similar findings were obtained in an analysis of patients with severe depression at baseline.

Positive effects of escitalopram on measures of sleep have been shown in a study by Lader and colleagues in comparison with citalopram. Patients with MDD associated with sleep problems, defined as MADRS item 4 score ≥ 4, were treated with escitalopram, citalopram or placebo. Patients treated with escitalopram showed improvement in mean MADRS item 4 score at weeks 4, 6 and 8 compared with patients treated with both placebo (p < 0.05) and citalopram (p < 0.01). Furthermore, few patients (< 6%) reported sleep-related, treatment-emergent adverse events, such as daytime somnolence and/or insomnia.

### Escitalopram (lexapro) for depression… [^597c6274]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Synopsis: Escitalopram is the active s-enantiomer of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram. It is labeled for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Safety: To date, no serious adverse effects have been associated with escitalopram. One study 1 demonstrated a slightly greater likelihood of activation of mania/hypomania in the treatment group as compared with the placebo group. Therefore, as with other antidepressants, escitalopram should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or hypomania. Escitalopram has not been evaluated in patients with seizure disorder or in patients with recent myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Because escitalopram has weak or negligible effects on the cytochrome P450 system, the potential for drug interactions is low.

2 However, as with other SSRIs, escitalopram should not be used in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAOI. Tolerability: The tolerability profile of escitalopram is predictable and similar to that of citalopram. 3 In research trials, pooled dropout rates because of adverse events in patients taking escitalopram, 10 mg daily, were similar to those in patients receiving placebo. 4 Nausea, insomnia, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction are more common than with placebo and are dosage related. Effectiveness: In comparison with placebo, escitalopram at dosages of both 10 mg and 20 mg daily decreases scores from baseline in the MADRS, HAM-D, and CGI-S more than placebo.

4 Of note, citalopram, in a dosage of 40 mg daily, was not more effective than escitalopram at 10 mg daily on the majority of the major efficacy outcome variables. 2 While there are limited data comparing escitalopram to other SSRIs or other classes of antidepressants, one would expect it to be as effective as citalopram, which is in turn similar in efficacy to fluoxetine.

Assessment of escitalopram tolerability and safety

In terms of safety and tolerability, data for escitalopram are available from over 4000 patients in double-blind treatment, representing approximately 1000 patient-years of exposure. Overall, the adverse-event profile detailed in published studies and meta-analyses is consistent with the known serotonergic properties of escitalopram. A meta-analysis of safety data from 24 double-blind, active-comparator or placebo-controlled, randomized studies with escitalopram was recently published. The most common adverse events (incidence ≥ 5%) reported during the first 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram, which were significantly more frequent than in the placebo group, were nausea, insomnia, fatigue, diarrhoea, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence and ejaculation failure (Table 3, available online). The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^6be06dfe]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine) and SNRIs (eg, duloxetine and venlafaxine) are the largest groups of nonhormone therapies studied, both in healthy women and cancer patients with VMS. They can reduce hot flash frequency by up to 58% and hot flash scores by up to 65%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs have also been compared with other drugs such as clonidine. As there is no convincing evidence supporting the superiority of any these agents over others, tolerability and side-effect profile are important determinants of treatment outcome. At present, paroxetine (Brisdelle, 7.5 mg) is the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause. Its efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with breast and gynecological cancers. However, due to its strong inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, paroxetine should be avoided in patients on tamoxifen treatment. Active metabolites of tamoxifen can be decreased by up to 64% in patients taking paroxetine. Likewise, fluoxetine, another strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, should also be avoided in tamoxifen-treated patients. In older adults, venlafaxine and paroxetine may not be the initial drug of choice due to risk of withdrawal. Escitalopram and citalopram may be the preferred drugs in this age group due to their lower side effect profile. Compared with citalopram, there are fewer cardiac side effects with escitalopram (eg, QTc prolongation). Drowsiness and dizziness are common adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs and can be potentially managed by adjusting the timing of administration. Taking the medication at night may not only alleviate symptoms from nocturnal VMS more effectively but also mitigate side effects such as nausea. Caution should be exercised in patients with hyponatremia, which can be associated with both cancer and SSRI use. Other adverse effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction and weight gain, which may overlap with symptoms of menopause, and should be considered in discussion on VMS treatment options. Regardless of the drug chosen, the lowest possible dose necessary for symptom relief should be used. Upon decision to stop the therapy, tapering should be done to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Discontinuing or switching selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors [^699b228d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe reasons for discontinuing or switching selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at 3 and 6 months after starting treatment, and to identify information provided to patients that may help prevent premature discontinuation of medication.

Methods

Telephone surveys were conducted at 3 and 6 months after patients (n = 672) were started on an SSRI for a new or recurrent case of depression.

Results

Significantly more patients discontinued or switched their SSRI because of an adverse effect within the first 3 months of starting (43%) compared with the second 3 months (27%; p = 0.023). The adverse effect most frequently reported as the reason for early discontinuation or switching was drowsiness/fatigue (10.2%), followed by anxiety, headache, and nausea - all at just over 5%. The odds ratio for discontinuation was 61% less in patients who recalled being told to take the medication for at least 6 months compared with those who did not (OR 0.39; p < 0.001). Patients who recalled being informed of potential adverse effects increased their reported incidence of mild to moderate adverse effects by 55% (OR 1.55; p < 0.05) without affecting rates of premature discontinuation (OR 1.06; p = 0.77).

Conclusions

Adverse effects are the most frequent reason for discontinuing or switching SSRIs within the first 3 months of treatment. Patients are more likely to continue taking their antidepressant if they fully understand how long to take the medication. Informing patients of potential adverse effects does not appear to prevent premature discontinuation, but may increase the patient's awareness and reporting of mild to moderate adverse effects.

### Comparison of toxicity of acute overdoses with citalopram and escitalopram [^76eaaa5c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Seizures and QTc prolongation are associated with citalopram poisoning; however, overdose experience with escitalopram is more limited.

Objectives

The goals of this study were to compare citalopram's vs. escitalopram's clinical effects in overdose, including the incidence of seizures.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted for single-substance acute overdoses with citalopram and escitalopram, managed in hospitals, that were reported to six U.S. poison centers from 2002–2005.

Results

There were 374 citalopram and 421 escitalopram overdose cases. Gender and ages were similar between the two, with 68–70% females and a median age of 20 years for citalopram and 18 years for escitalopram. Median dose by history was 310 mg for citalopram and 130 mg for escitalopram. More serious outcomes were associated with citalopram overdoses (p < 0.001). Most frequently reported clinical effects with citalopram and escitalopram were tachycardia, drowsiness, hypertension, and vomiting. Seizures (30 vs. 1, respectively, p < 0.001) and tremor (32 vs. 13, respectively, p = 0.001) were more common with citalopram. QTc prolongation occurred in 14 citalopram cases and 7 escitalopram cases (p = 0.109). There was an association between increasing dose and severity of outcome for citalopram (p < 0.001) and escitalopram (p = 0.011). In children < 6 years old, 12 of 66 citalopram and 5 of 57 escitalopram cases experienced toxicity, such as drowsiness, nausea/vomiting, and tachycardia. There were no seizures in this age group.

Conclusions

Escitalopram seems to be less toxic than citalopram after an acute overdose; seizures and tremors were more common with citalopram. Initial management of overdoses should include seizure precautions for citalopram and cardiac monitoring for both drugs.

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of escitalopram tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Concomitant Medications

Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions.

Interference with Psychomotor Performance

Because psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Alcohol

Patients should be told that, although escitalopram has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of escitalopram and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare providers if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with escitalopram.

Advise patients that escitalopram use later in pregnancy may lead to increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to escitalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise breastfeeding women using escitalopram to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^0cb151a2]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Phenotype ascertainment

This study focuses on participant-reported antidepressant adverse side effects. Participants first confirmed they had taken any of the ten most commonly prescribed antidepressants in Australia (sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and paroxetine). For each antidepressant taken, participants were asked whether they had experienced side effects and, if they did, to select which from a checklist with the twenty-three most commonly reported antidepressant side effects, including reduced sexual drive or desire, weight gain, dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, headache, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, agitation, shaking, constipation, diarrhoea, suicide attempt, blurred vision, muscle pain, vomiting, weight loss, runny nose and rash.

### Opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions: from the perspectives of evidence based on randomized controlled trials and clinical risk management [^b1d1b82d]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Paroxetine–oxycodone

Two RCTs determined whether inhibition of CYP2D6 alone by paroxetine (20 mg once daily) or inhibition of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by a combination of paroxetine (20 mg once daily) and itraconazole (200 mg once daily) administered for 5 days could alter the pharmacokinetics of and pharmacological response to i.v. oxycodone 0.1 mg/kg or oral immediate-release oxycodone 10 mg in healthy subjects. The effect of paroxetine on the plasma concentrations of i.v. oxycodone was negligible, whereas the combination of paroxetine and itraconazole prolonged the mean elimination half-life of i.v. oxycodone from 3.8 to 6.6 h (P < 0.001) and increased the exposure to i.v. oxycodone 2.0-fold (P < 0.001), but did not result in pharmacodynamic changes.

Paroxetine alone reduced the AUC(0–48 h) of the CYP2D6-dependent metabolite oxymorphone by 44% (P < 0.05), but had no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of oxycodone or its pharmacological effects following oral administration of oxycodone in healthy volunteers. Pretreatment of paroxetine and itraconazole increased the mean AUC (0–infinity) of oxycodone by 2.9-fold (P < 0.001), its C max by 1.8-fold (P < 0.001), and visual analog scores for subjective drug effects, drowsiness, and deterioration of performance (P < 0.05). It indicates that inhibition of both CYP3A4 and 2D6, rather than only CYP2D6, could precipitate substantial pharmacokinetic interactions with i.v. and oral oxycodone.

Escitalopram–tramadol

An RCT investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effect of escitalopram 20 mg/day on tramadol 150 mg in healthy subjects. Escitalopram could significantly decrease the median AUC (0–infinity) of (+)-M1 by 29%, but it did not impair the analgesic effect of tramadol assessed by the cold pressor test. The underlying mechanism may be that escitalopram is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 whereas paroxetine is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^44b33b3a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Summary points for efficacy:
efficacy advantage for escitalopram versus citalopram has been demonstrated in five randomized studies and two pooled analyses of clinical trials;
escitalopram may have an efficacy advantage over paroxetine, in terms of significant improvements in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-S scores and fewer discontinuations owing to lack of efficacy;
the efficacy of escitalopram compared with fluoxetine and sertraline requires further evaluation;
escitalopram and sertraline might be the best choice of antidepressant when starting treatment of patients with moderate to severe MDD;
the SNRI venlafaxine XR may be associated with greater remission or response rates in patients with MDD compared with SSRIs (Burk et al. 2002);
escitalopram has comparable efficacy to venlafaxine XR, with a possible slight advantage for escitalopram in patients with severe MDD

Regarding safety and tolerability, escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over duloxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (see summary points below) and may be preferable to those antidepressants in some patients with MDD.

Summary points for safety:
superior tolerability for escitalopram versus duloxetine, particularly for nausea, insomnia, dizziness and vomiting has been demonstrated in three randomized studies and a pooled analysis of two clinical trials (Lam et al. 2008)
escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (;, 2006);
escitalopram is less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms than several other antidepressants (2006)
no evidence of emergent risk of suicide with escitalopram;
incidence of sexual dysfunction-related adverse events similar to citalopram, but lower than venlafaxine XR and paroxetine.

Studies comparing escitalopram with serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors

The efficacy of escitalopram has been directly compared with that of venlafaxine XR in two randomized, double-blind studies, in a total of 484 patients, and found to be very similar, but with some advantage of escitalopram in patients with severe MDD. Three randomized, double-blind studies have compared the efficacy of escitalopram and duloxetine. Two of these revealed that patients treated with escitalopram had greater improvements in MADRS score: one study showed a statistically significantly greater efficacy for escitalopram compared with duloxetine at eight weeks; the other demonstrated that the mean change from baseline to week 8 in MADRS score was significantly greater in escitalopram- versus duloxetine-treated patients. Another study, designed to establish non-inferiority, demonstrated that duloxetine had as fast an onset of efficacy as escitalopram and was associated with similar efficacy over the 8 weeks of the study: 42.6% and 35.2% of patients had a 20% sustained reduction in HAM-D Maier subscale score with duloxetine and escitalopram, respectively (p = 0.097). Both treatments were better than placebo (p < 0.001 for duloxetine versus placebo and p = 0.008 for escitalopram versus placebo). However, in a six-month extension of this study, there was no significant difference in efficacy between escitalopram and duloxetine, although escitalopram did have a significantly improved effect on sleep. In a pooled analysis of two clinical studies by Lam and Wade, the incidence of nausea, insomnia, dizziness and vomiting was statistically significantly higher in patients treated with duloxetine compared with those treated with escitalopram; however, the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection was statistically significantly higher in patients treated with escitalopram. Overall, the authors concluded that escitalopram demonstrated superior tolerability, as evidenced by lower overall withdrawal rates as a result of adverse events. These findings mirror those from individual studies comparing escitalopram and duloxetine.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Incidence and duration of side effects and those rated as bothersome with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for depression: patient report versus physician estimate [^3e227b85]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used as the first-line treatment for depression. Information regarding their side effects is mostly based on controlled clinical trials.

Method

Patients who received an SSRI for a new or recurrent case of depression (ICD-9 code 296.2 or 311) between December 15, 1999, and May 31, 2000 were interviewed by telephone 75 to 105 days after initiation of SSRI therapy. Using closed-ended questions, investigators asked patients if they experienced any of 17 side effects commonly associated with SSRIs, how bothersome they were, and what their duration was. Prescribing physicians completed a written survey providing their estimates about frequency of side effects associated with SSRIs and how bothersome those side effects are.

Results

Of 401 patients who completed the phone interview, 344 patients (86%) reported at least 1 side effect, and 219 patients (55%) experienced 1 or more bothersome side effect(s). The most common bothersome side effects were sexual dysfunction and drowsiness (17% each). While most side effects first occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment, the majority of patients were still experiencing the same side effects at the time of interview, most notably blurred vision (85%) and sexual dysfunction (83%). Overall, physicians (N = 137) significantly underestimated the occurrence of the 17 side effects explored, and they tended to underrate how bothersome those side effects were to their patients.

Conclusion

Side effects associated with SSRIs are common and bothersome to patients. Treatment-emergent side effects tend to persist during the first 3 months of treatment.

### Resolution of sleepiness and fatigue: a comparison of bupropion and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in subjects with major depressive disorder achieving remission at doses approved in the European union [^58d1a50b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlike selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion may be classified as a dual noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a difference with potential implications for the treatment of residual sleepiness and fatigue in major depressive disorder (MDD). Post-hoc analysis of subjects with remitted MDD was performed on data pooled from six double-blind, randomized trials comparing the European Union (EU)-approved dose of ≤ 300 mg/day bupropion with SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram) for the resolution of sleepiness and fatigue. Hypersomnia score was defined as the sum of scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) items 22, 23, and 24; fatigue score as HDRS item 13 score; and remission as HDRS-17 ≤ 7. Similar proportions of bupropion- and SSRI-treated subjects achieved remission at study endpoint (169/343, 49.3% vs 324/656, 49.4%; last observation carried forward (LOCF), p = 0.45). Fewer bupropion-treated remitters had residual symptoms of sleepiness (32/169, 18.9% vs 104/324, 32.1%; p < 0.01) and fatigue (33/169, 19.5% vs 98/324, 30.2%; p < 0.05). Bupropion-treated remitters also showed greater improvement (mean change from baseline) in sleepiness (p < 0.05) and fatigue scores (p < 0.01) at endpoint: benefits were evident from week 2 for sleepiness (p < 0.01) and week 4 for fatigue (p < 0.01). Bupropion treatment at the EU-approved dose of ≤ 300 mg/day may offer advantages over SSRIs in the resolution of sleepiness and fatigue in remitted MDD patients.

Concomitant Medications

Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions.

Continuing the Therapy Prescribed

While patients may notice improvement with escitalopram oral solution therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.

Interference with Psychomotor Performance

Because psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram oral solution therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Alcohol

Patients should be told that, although escitalopram oral solution has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of escitalopram oral solution and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare providers if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with escitalopram oral solution.

Advise patients that escitalopram oral solution use later in pregnancy may lead to increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to escitalopram oral solution during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise breastfeeding women using escitalopram oral solution to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

2.2 Study design and experimental protocol

These data were acquired as a secondary outcome measure from a randomized, double‐blind, parallel study design (: NCT03162185, Open Science Framework), as previously reported (Molloy, Mueller, et al; Molloy, Zsido, et al.). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that 1‐week SSRI‐administration shifts cortical EIB using a novel EEG surrogate marker (Gao et al.), and to investigate whether the acute EIB response to a single dose of escitalopram can predict individual EIB responsivity after 7 days of drug‐intake (when plasma levels no longer fluctuate and relative steady‐state levels in healthy participants are reached (Rao,)). We administered 20 mg of escitalopram, which reliably blocks 80% of serotonin transporter and achieves steady‐state conditions after 1 week of administration (Kasper et al; Klein et al; Klein et al; Rao,) or an identical placebo capsule (mannitol/aerosol) from sequentially numbered containers at fixed times each day for 7 consecutive days. We recorded a baseline rs‐EEG prior to drug administration (baseline). Participants were then randomized to receive either escitalopram or placebo. Randomization employed an independent block randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio, conducted by the Pharmacy of the University Clinic at Leipzig University. The experimenter and participants were blind to treatment allocation. We recorded another rs‐EEG measurement following a single dose (single dose) and after 7 days of administration (when relatively steady‐state plasma levels are reached; Figure 1). All rs‐EEG measurements took place at approximately the same time of day for participants and 4–5 hr after escitalopram or placebo intake, as previous pharmacokinetic modeling in healthy participants suggests maximum drug plasma concentration is reached 3–5 hr after 20 mg oral escitalopram intake (Drewes, Thijssen, & Mengel; Søgaard, Mengel, Rao, & Larsen). We assessed potential changes in anxiety (State–Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI‐S]; Laux, Glanzmann, Schaffner, & Spielberger, nonpatient edition), current mood (German version of Profile of Mood States [POMS]; Dalbert,), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]; Bloch, Schoch, Zhang, & Russi,), and escitalopram side effects (Antidepressant Side‐Effect Checklist [ASEC]; Uher et al.). The STAI, POMS, ESS, and ASEC took place at approximately the same time of day for each participant. Serum follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Cobas; Roche) prior to enrollment to confirm downregulated ovarian hormones. We analyzed plasma escitalopram concentration from single dose and 1‐week steady state using a validated high‐performance liquid chromatography method (Teichert et al.), with four quality control samples covering the low, medium, and high range of the calibration curve. Deviation of the measured concentrations of the quality control samples was tested for an acceptance interval of ± 15%.

5.3 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram oral solution. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4 Seizures

4 Discussion

We report the incidence of SSRI treatment failure in a cohort of PwCF receiving treatment for depression or anxiety. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the incidence and potential predictors of SSRI treatment failure in PwCF. Specifically, our results highlight three key findings: (1) SSRI treatment failure is common in PwCF, (2) severity of depression and prior treatments may result in higher SSRI failure rates, and (3) SSRI treatment failure was significantly higher in a cohort of PwCF with actionable genotypes and prescribed a therapy not recommended for their genotype.

In our cohort we report 45% of PwCF experienced SSRI treatment failure with initial SSRI prescribed and PwCF received up to three SSRIs before finding an effective SSRI. This is consistent with studies in the general population, which have reported SSRI failure rates of 35–52%. Rates of ADRs were high in our cohort, with 45% of PwCF experiencing at least one ADR. In a study of 125 South Asian subjects with moderate to severe depression treated with escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine or paroxetine, ADRs were experienced by 26.4% of subjects and included drowsiness, psychological disturbances, and GI upset most. This markedly lower rate of ADRs compared to our population may be explained by the exclusion of those with comorbid chronic medical conditions as well as comorbid psychiatric disorders. The STAR*D trial, which included those with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, reported ADR rates similar to our cohort of 49.9% 12 weeks after citalopram initiation. In our cohort, ADRs lead to discontinuation in 11.4% of PwCF and contributed to 25.3% of treatment failures. This is consistent with meta‐analyses that report early discontinuation due to ADR in 5‐12% of subjects, and comparable to the 8.6% reported in the STAR*D trial.

Post-stroke depression — evidence summary for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy: Li, L. et al. (2020) found that paroxetine was superior to "routine treatment" at 4-week and 12-week follow-up in 98 patients (2 RCTs) with post-stroke depression as measured by the HAM-D, with 4-week follow-up MD: -7.64; 95% CI: -10.05 – -5.23; p < 0.0001 and 12-week follow-up MD: -9.79; 95% CI: -16.94 – -2.64; p = 0.007. Feng et al. (2022) found that escitalopram (mostly dosed at 5–10 mg per day) was superior to placebo at 1- to 12-month follow-up in 612 patients (7 RCTs) with or without depression at baseline as measured by the HAM-D and other measures at the end of treatment (SMD: -1.25; 95% CI: -1.82– -0.68; p < 0.001). Findings did not differ by depression status at baseline. Li, X. et al. (2020) performed an NMA of 15 RCTs with 5,547 patients with post-stroke depression measuring mean change in total HAM-D score after multiple antidepressants, and extensive analyses comparing SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo revealed that SSRIs and SNRIs consistently outperformed placebo at 4-week follow-up, 8-week follow-up, and end of treatment, with the mean change in HAM-D score consistently meeting the MCID for all analyses except for paroxetine at 4 weeks. These ADs included tricyclic ADs, which are not recommended for treatment of depression in the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder because of their side effect profile, and the SR data should be interpreted with caution because of missing key information such as time since stroke and past AD treatment; multiple studies did not explicitly delineate whether patients were diagnosed with depression at baseline or merely exhibited depressive symptoms. The potential benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs and the risks of untreated depression must be balanced with the potential harms, and common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nausea, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and reduced sexual desire or function.

### A stratified precision medicine trial targeting α-adrenergic receptor agonism as a treatment for the cognitive biotype of depression [^875ba87e]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

GIR treatment

We chose GIR for this study because of its selectivity for α 2A receptor agonism, concentrated in the prefrontal circuits regions of interest for the cognitive biotype of depression. GIR enhances prefrontal function by mimicking the beneficial effects of norepinephrine at postsynaptic α 2A receptors on dLPFC spines, strengthening connectivity through inhibition of the cAMP−PKA−K + signaling pathway. Foundational evidence demonstrates that this mechanism translates across species with consistent effects across rodents, monkeys and humans. In rodent work, GIR is more effective at protecting cognition from stress exposure than clonidine, suggesting that guanfacine's selective benefits are not primarily due to reducing norepinephrine release, as clonidine is more potent than guanfacine in this regard. The selectivity of GIR for α 2A receptor agonism is 10× higher than for α2B receptors. Steady-state levels are typically attained within 4 days, and the average elimination half-life is approximately 17 h (range 10−30 h; FDA package insert). Clinical studies have established the safety profile of GIR in humans, and there is no evidence for tachyphylaxis with GIR in trials of up to 8 weeks –. The most common adverse events include drowsiness, dry mouth, headache and dizziness.

Before commencing GIR, participants who had been taking psychotropic medications underwent a carefully monitored down-titration and subsequent washout period of five half-lives, overseen by the participant's primary mental health provider. In one case, due to clinical considerations, a participant continued on escitalopram 20 mg, an exception approved by the study team.

GIR was dosed once nightly to minimize the potential sedative effects. GIR was commenced at a dose of 0.5 mg and up-titrated every 3 days by 0.5 mg to a goal dose of 2 mg by the second week. The total treatment period was 8 weeks, and participants met protocol criteria by completing at least 6 weeks of treatment. Owing to the open-label design, clinical personnel were not blinded to treatment status. However, all analyses were undertaken with personnel blind to the participants' response status.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^0464e721]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Three randomized, double-blind studies have assessed the safety of escitalopram compared with that of duloxetine, which were not included in the analysis by. Duloxetine was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, particularly insomnia and constipation, as well as significant increases in the incidence of nausea, dry mouth, yawning and vomiting (all p < 0.05), and in two out of the three studies, these adverse events accounted for an increase in the rate of discontinuation in patients treated with duloxetine compared with those treated with escitalopram. Although, in one study, escitalopram was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction at 4 weeks when compared with duloxetine, there was no significant difference at 12 weeks and no difference in the rates of discontinuations due to sexual dysfunction.

### Antidepressant side effects and their impact on treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder: an iSPOT-D report [^f6b99ae9]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are first-line pharmacological treatments for people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. However, SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with a range of side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, increased suicidal thoughts, nausea/vomiting, sexual dysfunction, and increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. While specific antidepressant side effects are diverse, they also occur generally with a high frequency, intensity, and burden. Previous studies suggest that frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects are impacted by antidepressant treatment type, anxiety symptoms, and the presence of anxious depression (for a review, see Ionescu et al.).

Anxious depression is present in approximately half of the MDD population and is commonly defined either syndromally (i.e. co-occurring MDD and anxiety disorder diagnoses) or using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression (HRSD 17) criteria (i.e. MDD diagnosis and an HRSD 17 anxiety/somatisation factor score of ≥ 7). Some, but not all studies suggest that anxious depression increases the severity of side effects (for a review, see Ionescu et al.). For example, people with anxious depression were found to have a greater maximum frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects compared to people with non-anxious depression in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial. A greater side effect severity has also been found at various study endpoints in people with anxious depression compared to people with MDD only. However, these associations are not found in all definitions of anxious depression, with Gaspersz et al. finding no differences in the frequency of side effects between people with syndromal and non-syndromal anxious depression.

Paroxetine controlled release — adult dosing and duration, adverse effects, and cautions are detailed: 62.5 mg/d (12.5–75 mg/d), starting at 25 mg/d and increasing by 12.5 mg/d at intervals of at least one week, with an adequate trial of 12 weeks, and use lower doses in the elderly. Notable adverse effects include drowsiness, nausea, insomnia, headache, dizziness, diaphoresis, weakness, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, akathisia, suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, sexual dysfunction, and discontinuation syndrome. Comments include availability of immediate-release tablets (20–60 mg/d), contraindicated with MAOIs and within 14 days of starting or stopping MAOIs, and that it is the most sedating SSRI with potent anticholinergic effects and as a 2D6 substrate has potentially significant interactions that may require dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of toludesvenlafaxine hydrochloride sustained-release tablets in depression with anhedonia: a single-arm, multicenter clinical study [^edecbbd0]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, we found that toludesvenlafaxine medication was safe and well-tolerated. The TEAEs were mild to moderated and no serious adverse effects occurred due to the medication. In the current study, 4.1% of participants withdrew from the trial due to the adverse effects related to toludesvenlafaxine. The drop rates attributed to adverse effects were 5.3%–5.4% for escitalopram, 6.8% for vortioxetine, and 12.9% for SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine), illustrating the superior safety and tolerability of toludesvenlafaxine compared to other common antidepressants. The most common drug-related adverse effects include dry mouth, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and drowsiness, which are similar to the common adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs.

Sexual dysfunction (SD) is one of the most common adverse effects of antidepressants, resulting in premature discontinuation of antidepressant treatment, relapse, and worsened health outcomes and quality. Studies have reported that the prevalence of treatment-emergent SD in depressed patients prescribed either an SSRI or SNRI to be between 37.1 and 61.5%, whereas the incidence of SD in our study was only 1%, further demonstrating the ability of toludesvenlafaxine to ameliorate anhedonia and depressive symptoms with less impact on the patient's quality of life.

These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of toludesvenlafaxine as a promising therapeutic method for improving both depressive symptoms and quality of life in patients with significant anhedonia. Especially, toludesvenlafaxine demonstrated a more rapid onset of action, with significant improvements in anhedonia observed as early as 2 weeks of treatment compared with other antidepressants. This quick response may offer patients faster relief, a crucial factor in managing depression. Moreover, compared to other antidepressants, toludesvenlafaxine has a much lower incidence of side effects, especially sexual side effects. This suggests that toludesvenlafaxine may be a safer option for patients with depression and could serve as an alternative for those who experience SD from other antidepressants.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials of escitalopram, there were reports of escitalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 600 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of escitalopram, escitalopram oral solution overdoses involving overdoses of over 1000 mg have been reported. As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported.

Symptoms most often accompanying escitalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, included convulsions, coma, dizziness, hypotension, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, somnolence, and ECG changes (including QT prolongation and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdose

Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for escitalopram oral solution.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^c2a3cd28]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

For some individuals, however, stopping treatment with SSRI/SNRIs can cause various unpleasant physiological and psychological symptoms such as nausea, sleep problems, lethargy, dysphoric mood, paraesthesia and dizziness. Although some of these symptoms overlap with symptoms of MDD, this "discontinuation syndrome" is distinct from a relapse and may last up to 6 weeks, or even up to 12 weeks for some patients. Symptom usually resolve by reintroducing SSRI/SNRIs. Previous research pooling data from small scale studies of the related psychedelic compound 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) showed that discontinuing reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications (versus no immediate prior use of such medications) had a negative impact on study outcomes in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – meaning that those who were unmedicated before the start of the trial responded better to MDMA. The effects of discontinuing SSRI/SNRIs on study outcomes have yet to be formally tested in trials of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics. Moreover, it is important to note that the interplay between patient expectations and clinical outcomes is a complex and critical element in the design and interpretation of medical trials. This becomes even more pronounced in studies involving psychotropic substances, such as psychedelics, where subjective experiences and personal beliefs can markedly influence patient responses. In light of this, it becomes essential to explore how preconceived notions about treatment, particularly among those with prior experiences with SSRI/SNRIs, might shape the outcomes of such trials.

The aim of the current paper was this to explore a potential "discontinuation effect" of SSRI/SNRIs titration prior to study commencement in thetrial. Specifically, we investigated through exploratory post hoc analyses (inspired by published comments tofor possible differences in outcomes in participants who did and did not discontinue SSRI/SNRIs (venlafaxine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine and citalopram) at the start of the trial (referred to as "discontinuers" and "unmedicated" respectively). Additionally, we explored if baseline expectations of response to treatment affected outcomes in either group.

### Understanding antidepressant mechanism of action and its effect on efficacy and safety [^17b4b50a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Common side effects of antidepressants, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributable to their mechanisms of action. Antidepressants are neurotransmitter uptake blockers, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter receptor blockers. Various mechanisms of action can determine how quickly therapeutic benefit becomes apparent and whether certain acute and persistent side effects occur. Understanding mechanism of action can help clinicians select appropriate antidepressants for individual patients and manage adherence problems due to intolerability. Although more research is needed to further elucidate specific antidepressant mechanisms of action, clinicians can use current knowledge to tailor treatment decisions, such as switching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action when intolerable adverse events are experienced.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram, the S-enantiomer of racemic citalopram, is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that escitalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. Escitalopram is at least 100-fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake and inhibition of 5-HT neuronal firing rate. Tolerance to a model of antidepressant effect in rats was not induced by long-term (up to 5 weeks) treatment with escitalopram. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1 to 7) or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D1 to 5), histamine (H1 to 3), muscarinic (M1 to 5), and benzodiazepine receptors. Escitalopram also does not bind to, or has low affinity for, various ion channels including Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++channels. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular side effects of other psychotropic drugs.

### Residual symptoms and functionality in depressed outpatients: a one-year observational study in Switzerland with escitalopram [^ec52f115]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Residual depressive symptoms are associated with a poor prognosis for relapse or recurrence and are recognized as impeding factors of functionality. Recovery to the pre-depression level of functioning should be the goal of treatment.

Aim

To evaluate outcomes in depressed outpatients treated with escitalopram regarding response, recovery, residual symptoms, functionality and ability to work over 48 weeks.

Method

3278 outpatients were evaluated at weeks 8, 24 and 48. A simple questionnaire was used to rate severity of illness, impairment of functionality, treatment response, tolerability, presence and severity of residual symptoms, whether remission with residual symptoms or recovery was achieved, and to what degree the patient was able to work.

Results

Data over the full 48-week period were available for 75.8% of patients, for whom treatment response was rated as "very good" or "good" in 81%. However, only 42% of the completing patients achieved recovery without residual symptoms, while 41% were rated as remitters with residual symptoms. Lack of energy/motivation was the most common reported residual symptom and was present in 23.5% of patients at study end. Concentration difficulties were present in 15.8% and impaired sleep in 13.9% of patients. Complete inability to work decreased from 36% at baseline to 9% at week 48, while full-time working capacity increased from 37% to 62%.

Limitations

Non-controlled observational real life study using simple ratings rather than established rating scales.

Conclusion

 < 50% of patients completing a one-year antidepressant treatment regimen were rated as being symptomatically fully recovered, and ≈50% still reported functional deficits.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.

With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2–2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.

Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.

Distribution

The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trial Data Sources

Adults

Adverse reactions information for Lexapro was collected from 715 patients with major depressive disorder who were exposed to escitalopram and from 592 patients who were exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. An additional 284 patients with major depressive disorder were newly exposed to escitalopram in open-label trials. The adverse reaction information for Lexapro in patients with GAD was collected from 429 patients exposed to escitalopram and from 427 patients exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of escitalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Concomitant Medications

Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions.

Interference with Psychomotor Performance

Because psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram tablets therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Alcohol

Patients should be told that, although escitalopram has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of escitalopram and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare providers if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with escitalopram tablets.

17.1 Information for Patients

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Lexapro.

General Information about Medication Guide

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Lexapro and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Lexapro. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Lexapro.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Modeling the efficacy of a novel antidepressant zuranolone for major depressive disorder [^9221834e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

This research aimed to quantify the treatment potential of zuranolone-a novel positive allosteric GABA A receptor modulator-in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Publicly available databases were systematically searched to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials. We used changes in rating scale scores from baseline to perform a model-based meta-analysis, characterizing the progression of drug efficacy and placebo response over time and comparing zuranolone's efficacy and safety profiles with those of established antidepressants (escitalopram and amitriptyline). Pharmacokinetic modeling and meta-analysis frameworks were applied to assess efficacy and placebo response characteristics. A total of 37 trials (N = 8735 individuals) were incorporated in the final analysis. Zuranolone exhibited a rapid onset of action (k = 0.75 day -1), 10-fold and 27.8-fold faster than amitriptyline (k = 0.075 day -1) and escitalopram (k = 0.027 day -1), respectively. Amitriptyline exhibited the highest pure efficacy, continuously increasing over time. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of zuranolone and escitalopram overlapped, suggesting similar efficacy. Zuranolone achieved significant symptom improvement within two weeks of treatment (-6.64%, 95% CI: -9.77% to -3.39%) and sustained efficacy through four weeks post-treatment. The dropout rate was lower with zuranolone (2.4%, 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.3%) than with escitalopram (4.5%, 95% CI: 3.0 to 5.9%). Primary adverse events related to zuranolone included somnolence, headache, dizziness, and sedation, with no severe safety signals observed. Zuranolone demonstrates a safety profile comparable to escitalopram as well as rapid-onset antidepressant action, sustained clinical efficacy, and favorable tolerability, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic option for MDD.

### Serotonin syndrome caused by escitalopram in Parkinson's disease psychosis: a case report [^7ab5379e]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serotonin syndrome and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two diseases whose symptoms partially overlap; this poses challenges in distinguishing them in clinical practice. Early manifestations such as tremor, akathisia, diaphoresis, hypertonia and hyperreflexia are common in mild-to-moderate serotonin syndrome and can also occur in PD. Without prompt recognition and treatment, serotonin syndrome can rapidly progress, potentially leading to severe complications such as multiple organ failure within hours. Given their disparate treatment strategies, accurate clinical distinction is crucial for effective treatment. This case study explores a patient with serotonin syndrome triggered by escitalopram in the context of PD psychosis (PDP), providing insights into diagnosis and treatment planning.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old Asian woman with a one-year history of PD, a two-month history of PDP, and a six-year history of depression presented with symptoms including hyperreflexia, tremor, hypertonia, impaired level of consciousness, and inappropriate behavior following a recent one-month adjustment in medication. Initially suspected of being drug-induced parkinsonism or worsening PD, therapeutic drug monitoring revealed warning levels of escitalopram. Subsequent diagnoses confirmed serotonin syndrome. This syndrome may result from increased cortical serotonin activity at the serotonin2A receptor due to dopamine and serotonin imbalances in PDP, compounded by increased dopamine-mediated serotonin release. Additionally, being an intermediate metabolizer of cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C19, the patient experienced excessive escitalopram accumulation, exacerbating her condition.

Conclusions

This case underscores the critical need to differentiate between symptoms of serotonin syndrome and PD, particularly in manifestations like tremor and hypertonia. Careful consideration of receptor profiles in patients with PDP is essential when selecting antidepressants to mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome.

### Acute effects of psilocybin after escitalopram or placebo pretreatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in healthy subjects [^9ee53a85]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Psychedelics are typically investigated and intended to be used in patients with psychiatric disorders who may already be treated with antidepressant medications, typically serotonin transporter inhibitors. Case reports indicated that chronic administration of the serotonin transporter inhibitors fluoxetine and sertraline reduced effects of LSD in recreational users. Therefore, one assumption was that antidepressants generally reduce the response to psychedelics. Patients in clinical studies who used psilocybin typically had to be free of concomitant antidepressant treatment for 2 weeks before randomization and then for the duration of the study, or medications that affect the serotonin system were stopped at least 5 half‐lives before psilocybin administrationor study inclusion. Similarly, patients who receive LSD pause antidepressant treatment typically for 5 days before LSD treatment. Adverse effects could also occur if antidepressants and psychedelics are used together, including QT‐time prolongation and serotonin toxicity. However, the general practice of stopping antidepressant treatment can also be problematic in some patients who require antidepressant treatment or suffer from withdrawal when stopping it. The interruption or discontinuation of antidepressant treatment often leads to withdrawal symptoms, including dizziness, nausea/vomiting, headache, and lethargy, and can also trigger the relapse of depression. Negative mood states before psilocybin administration may also result in a less positive response to psilocybin.

Unclear is whether an antidepressant must be stopped before psychedelic administration. Therefore, we investigated whether escitalopram pretreatment alters the acute subjective and adverse effects of a full dose of psilocybin (25 mg) in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study in healthy subjects. Escitalopram was administered for 14 days (10 mg daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg daily for 7 days) to produce plasma escitalopram concentrations that are similar to patients who are on chronic antidepressant treatment. Outcome measures included subjective effects, alterations of mind, mystical‐type experiences, cardiostimulant and adverse effects, QT time, and plasma concentrations of psilocin, psilocin metabolites, escitalopram, and BDNF. Expression of the HTR2A and SCL6A4 genes (which encode the 5‐HT 2A receptor and serotonin transporter, respectively) was also determined after pretreatment to explore the mechanisms that contribute to a potentially lower response to 5‐HT 2A receptor stimulation after serotonin transporter inhibition. The primary study end point was the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) scale. We hypothesized that escitalopram pretreatment would significantly reduce 5D‐ASC total scores compared with placebo pretreatment.

Antidepressant and antianxiety medication discontinuation and contraceptive considerations — rates and the obstetrician–gynecologist's role are noted: More than one third of those who are prescribed antidepressant and antianxiety medications discontinue use within the first 3 months of drug initiation; another 25% stop use between 3 months and 6 months because of unacceptable adverse effects, most commonly continued drowsiness, decreased sexual libido, and anxiety. The obstetrician–gynecologist, when reviewing current medications, may be the first health care provider to learn that a patient is no longer taking her medication and can refer the patient back to her mental health care professional; additionally, some data report higher rates of contraceptive nonuse, misuse, and discontinuation among women with symptoms of mental health disorders compared with asymptomatic women, and proactive counseling about long-acting, highly effective contraceptive methods may be beneficial in this population.

Serotonin syndrome and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two diseases whose symptoms partially overlap; this poses challenges in distinguishing them in clinical practice. Early manifestations such as tremor, akathisia, diaphoresis, hypertonia and hyperreflexia are common in mild-to-moderate serotonin syndrome and can also occur in PD. Without prompt recognition and treatment, serotonin syndrome can rapidly progress, potentially leading to severe complications such as multiple organ failure within hours. Given their disparate treatment strategies, accurate clinical distinction is crucial for effective treatment. This case study explores a patient with serotonin syndrome triggered by escitalopram in the context of PD psychosis (PDP), providing insights into diagnosis and treatment planning.

Case Presentation

A 75-year-old Asian woman with a one-year history of PD, a two-month history of PDP, and a six-year history of depression presented with symptoms including hyperreflexia, tremor, hypertonia, impaired level of consciousness, and inappropriate behavior following a recent one-month adjustment in medication. Initially suspected of being drug-induced parkinsonism or worsening PD, therapeutic drug monitoring revealed warning levels of escitalopram. Subsequent diagnoses confirmed serotonin syndrome. This syndrome may result from increased cortical serotonin activity at the serotonin2A receptor due to dopamine and serotonin imbalances in PDP, compounded by increased dopamine-mediated serotonin release. Additionally, being an intermediate metabolizer of cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C19, the patient experienced excessive escitalopram accumulation, exacerbating her condition.

Conclusions

This case underscores the critical need to differentiate between symptoms of serotonin syndrome and PD, particularly in manifestations like tremor and hypertonia. Careful consideration of receptor profiles in patients with PDP is essential when selecting antidepressants to mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^d09276c5]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

We incorporated the results of the trial of pregabalin in FD into a previous meta-analysis, including 1302 patients. Overall, there was a benefit of gut–brain neuromodulators in FD, with an RR of symptoms not improving of 0.77 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.89) (Supplementary Figure 9). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 64%), and the effect was limited to TCAs at a dose of 10–50 mg once daily in four RCTs (0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90, I² = 4%), the antipsychotic drugs sulpiride 100 mg four times a day or levosulpiride 25 mg three times a day in three trials (RR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67, I² = 0%), and pregabalin 75 mg once daily in one trial (RR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96). Trials of sulpiride and levosulpiride were at unclear risk of bias, and the number of included patients was small, meaning that firm conclusions cannot be drawn from these data, whereas RCTs of TCAs were more rigorous. Moreover, levosulpiride is unavailable in some countries, including the UK. There was no evidence of a benefit of SSRIs in two RCTs (sertraline 50 mg once daily or escitalopram 10 mg once daily), or the SNRI venlafaxine 150 mg once daily in one trial. Although the trial of venlafaxine was negative, the dose was down-titrated to 75 mg once daily during the final 2 weeks of the study and SNRIs are efficacious in other chronic painful disorders, suggesting more RCTs in FD are required. 5-HT 1A agonists, as a group, were no more efficacious than placebo, but a Japanese trial demonstrated a benefit of tandospirone 10 mg three times a day in 150 patients with FD. Rates of adverse events, such as dizziness and drowsiness, were significantly higher among those taking gut–brain neuromodulators, although when individual drug classes were studied this was only the case for TCAs in two RCTs. However, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were no more likely with TCAs. Dizziness was particularly an issue with pregabalin, reported by over 50% of patients assigned to the drug.

### Escitalopram therapy for major depression and anxiety disorders [^8de5be83]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is efficacious in a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but the individual trials are insufficiently large to allow a full exploration of its tolerability.

Objective

To assess the tolerability and safety of escitalopram through analysis of all randomized controlled clinical trials in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Analyses of tolerability were based on data from all available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies completed by December 2006 in which escitalopram was compared with placebo or active compounds (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more frequently with escitalopram than with placebo were listed, and tolerability and safety were evaluated.

Results

Nausea was the only AE with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and 5 percentage points greater than with placebo during short-term treatment. In general, AEs were mild to moderate in severity. AEs related to sexual dysfunction were similarly frequent with escitalopram and citalopram, but were higher with paroxetine. No suicide occurred among escitalopram-treated patients, and there were no significant differences between escitalopram and placebo in incidence of suicidal behavior, measured by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The 8 week withdrawal rate due to AEs was higher with escitalopram than with placebo (7.3% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) but lower than with paroxetine (6.6% vs 9.0%; p < 0.01) or venlafaxine (6.1% vs 13.2%; p < 0.01) (Fisher's Exact test, 2 tailed). Compared with paroxetine, escitalopram resulted in significantly fewer discontinuation symptoms (average increase in Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale of 1.6 vs 3.9; p < 0.01). There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values in patients treated with escitalopram. Mean weight change after 6 months of treatment with escitalopram (0.58 ± 2.63 kg) was similar to that with placebo (0.15 ± 2.33 kg). The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar to that with placebo. The risk of AEs was no higher in special patient populations, such as the elderly (≥ 65 y of age) or those with hepatic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 4000 escitalopram-treated patients, escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in short- and long-term treatment.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^01dbdfce]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the recent past it has been thought that there is very little difference in both efficacy and safety between antidepressants currently available. However, there is evidence suggesting that the mechanistic advantages of escitalopram over the R -enantiomer and racemic citalopram translate into clinical efficacy benefits, both in the context of clinical studies and the 'real-life' setting. In addition, there is evidence that the onset of treatment response is earlier with the S -enantiomer alone.

Evidence for an efficacy advantage over other SSRIs and SNRIs is less robust, but escitalopram does appear to offer some tolerability advantages over several other antidepressants, particularly the SNRIs, venlafaxine XR and duloxetine. Escitalopram is, therefore, associated with a favourable benefit-risk ratio compared with some other antidepressant agents. These advantages, seem to be associated with the drug's unique chemistry and pharmacological actions.

Second-generation antidepressant dosing and trial durations — comparative adverse effects by agent: In trials, bupropion was used for 12–14 wk at 200–450 mg/d with a lower rate of sexual adverse events than escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline; citalopram was used for 8–20 wk at 20–40 mg/d with a possible increased risk for QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes at dosages > 40 mg/d; fluoxetine was used for 4–6 wk at 10–80 mg/d with the lowest rates of discontinuation syndrome compared with other SSRIs; paroxetine was used for 4–52 wk at 20–60 mg/d with the highest rates of sexual dysfunction among SSRIs, higher rates of weight gain, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome; and venlafaxine XR was used for 14 wk at 75–225 mg/d with higher rates of nausea and vomiting, higher rates of discontinuations due to adverse events than SSRIs as a class, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome. Common adverse effects associated with SGAs include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence.

### Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression [^9d98cf50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies.

### Symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness in major depressive disorder [^a40b3ca9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Fatigue and sleepiness (hypersomnia) are symptoms that are highly prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Individuals who complain of fatigue but do not have diagnosable depression are at a higher risk for developing MDD later in life than individuals who do not complain of fatigue. Fatigue and sleepiness also appear to be particularly difficult to treat, as they are often encountered as residual symptoms among MDD patients who have remitted following treatment with standard antidepressants. There are 3 main approaches for addressing fatigue and sleepiness in depression: first, prescribing antidepressant medications that are less likely to exacerbate these particular symptoms; second, prescribing antidepressant medications that are more likely to resolve these symptoms; third, the use of adjunctive treatments to specifically target residual fatigue and sleepiness in depression.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^0986de5d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Why might escitalopram confer clinical advantages to citalopram?

Careful consideration of a drug's stereochemistry is becoming increasingly important when developing new antidepressants to provide greater insight into the pharmacological subtleties of the agents being prescribed in clinical practice. It can be postulated that the observed clinical benefits of escitalopram compared with citalopram are conferred by the pharmacological and pharmacodynamic properties of the constituent enantiomers. These properties are summarized below.

In addition to overall clinical efficacy in terms of symptom improvement, another potential clinical advantage that escitalopram may confer compared with citalopram is earlier onset of action. Increasing attention has been focused on the requirement for antidepressant medications to have a rapid onset of effect, since this can translate into clinical benefit in terms of symptom control and treatment continuation. Initial clinical results, which were identified in the literature search (Table 1, available online), suggested that escitalopram had a faster onset of action compared with citalopram (see summary points below). It has been suggested that the reduction in serotonergic activity as a result of autoreceptor activation is the rate-limiting step in the clinical response to antidepressants. Therefore, more rapid desensitization of the receptors, as observed with escitalopram, could lead to a faster onset of action.

Summary points for escitalopram versus citalopram:
escitalopram (S -enantiomer) has improved pharmacological potency as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in vitro versus the R -enantiomer; the S -enantiomer has the benefit of allosterically modulating the SERT; (Hyttel et al. 1992)
the R -enantiomer is metabolized more slowly than the S -enantiomer, resulting in approximately two-fold higher plasma concentration of the R -enantiomer;
R -citalopram may have a functional antagonistic effect on escitalopram with significantly higher occupancy 6 h post-dose with escitalopram (10 mg/day: 82%) compared with citalopram (20 mg/day: 64%);
R -citalopram should not be considered an inactive enantiomer: it may have a deleterious influence on the activity of escitalopram through functional antagonism;
escitalopram may have a faster onset of action than citalopram as a result of more rapid desensitization of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A subtype autoreceptors, leading to more rapid disinhibition of the serotonergic neurones, and enhanced release of serotonin.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

Escitalopram is contraindicated in patients:

taking MAOIs with escitalopram or within 14 days of stopping treatment with escitalopram because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of escitalopram within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Starting escitalopram in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
taking pimozide [see Drug Interactions (7)]
with a hypersensitivity to escitalopram or citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in escitalopram.

Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with escitalopram or within 14 days of stopping treatment with escitalopram. Do not use escitalopram within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start escitalopram in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (4)

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^687f0e18]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies comparing escitalopram with citalopram

A total of five randomized, double-blind studies have directly compared the efficacy of escitalopram (10–20 mg) with that of citalopram (10–40 mg) in more than 1700 patients. The mean change in MADRS score was significantly greater in patients receiving escitalopram than citalopram at both six and eight weeks. At 24 weeks, however, there was no significant difference in efficacy between citalopram and escitalopram. In the two placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in which citalopram was used as an active comparator, analysis of time to separation from placebo showed that escitalopram (10–20 mg) resulted in a statistically significant separation from placebo on all rating scales during weeks 1–2, compared with weeks 6–8 for citalopram (20–40 mg). This suggests that treatment with escitalopram is associated with earlier relief of depressive symptoms compared with citalopram, which is in keeping with findings from preclinical studies. Only a single study reported an increased prevalence of adverse events with citalopram compared with escitalopram; in all other studies, both treatments were found to be equally safe and well tolerated.

Furthermore, three pooled analyses have compared the efficacy of escitalopram with that of citalopram. In these three studies, escitalopram was superior to citalopram with respect to MADRS score. In the study by, for example, the mean decrease from baseline in MADRS total score in the results of the pooled studies was greater after eight weeks of treatment in escitalopram-treated patients than in those treated with citalopram, even in a subpopulation of severely ill patients (i.e. those with MADRS score of ≥ 30). Two early pooled analyses of the initial registration trials showed a faster onset and superior efficacy of escitalopram compared with citalopram. Data on speed of onset need to be viewed cautiously because statistical separation is partly dependent on subject numbers.

### Severe sleepiness and excess sleep duration induced by paroxetine treatment is a beneficial pharmacological effect, not an adverse reaction [^2452511f]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sleepiness and excess sleep duration, "Hypersomnia", induced by paroxetine treatment are generally considered adverse drug reactions, however, our experience indicates that patients with depressive disorder who experience "Hypersomnia" during paroxetine treatment have good clinical response. The aim of this study was to determine if "Hypersomnia" during paroxetine treatment is a beneficial pharmacological effect or an adverse drug reaction, and to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms on individual differences in the occurrence of "Hypersomnia" induced by paroxetine.

Methods

A consecutive series of 46 Japanese patients with depressive disorder were treated with paroxetine. Patients who complained of great drowsiness or who slept for more than 12-h per day over seven days were identified as having experienced "Hypersomnia". For the clinical improvement rates and genotype distribution of the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), serotonin transporter and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), the group that showed "Hypersomnia" induced by paroxetine treatment and the group that did not show "Hypersomnia" were compared statistically.

Results

Patients who experienced "Hypersomnia" (17.4%) showed a significantly higher response rate at two weeks than did patients who did not experience "Hypersomnia" (p = 0.0127). No significant association between the occurrence of "Hypersomnia" and genetic polymorphisms was found.

Limitations

We cannot exclude the risk of false positive errors due to the relatively small sample sizes.

Conclusions

"Hypersomnia" during paroxetine treatment for depression is a beneficial pharmacological effect, not an adverse drug reaction.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^1bbc66f9]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram, the S-enantiomer of racemic citalopram, is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that escitalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. Escitalopram is at least 100-fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake and inhibition of 5-HT neuronal firing rate. Tolerance to a model of antidepressant effect in rats was not induced by long-term (up to 5 weeks) treatment with escitalopram. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7) or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D1-5), histamine (H1-3), muscarinic (M1-5), and benzodiazepine receptors. Escitalopram also does not bind to, or has low affinity for, various ion channels including Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++channels. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular side effects of other psychotropic drugs.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27–32 hours. With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2–2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.

Absorption and Distribution

Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.

The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and the volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.

The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^d5a60f7c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Agomelatine should be considered as an alternative approach to the treatment of depressed patients with marked insomnia symptoms. Agomelatine is a non-sedative antidepressant drug exerting agonistic action at melatonergic M1 and M2 receptors, and antagonistic action at serotonergic 5-HT2c receptors. Such pharmacodynamic profile is related to sleep-promoting action without the risk of sedation and weight gain. In comparison to escitalopram, agomelatine is known to improve sleep latency after both short (after 2 weeks) and long (after 24 weeks) treatment. Moreover, both drugs differ significantly in their effect on sleep continuity. In the second week, agomelatine slightly improves sleep continuity (increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency) and escitalopram worsens it. Moreover, treatment with agomelatine is not related to the suppression of REM sleep: it restores cyclical sleep profile, may increase the amount of SWS, and most importantly leads to the improvement of daytime alertness.

Effects on sleep has recently been also reported for a vortioxetine, with clinical action mediated mainly by selective blockade of serotonin reuptake and direct modulation of serotonergic receptors activity (such as 5-HT3, 5-HT7, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1B). In a study which has compared the effects of vortioxetine and paroxetine to the placebo in a group of 24 healthy male volunteers, it has been shown that the vortioxetine dose of 20 and 40 mg similarly to the paroxetine dose of 20 mg suppresses REM sleep by increasing REM sleep latency and diminishing duration of REM sleep. Both drugs also decrease total sleep time and increase duration of sleep stage N1. These negative effects of vortioxetine on sleep continuity are significant only for the higher dose. According to the FDA clinical trial register, the rate of treatment-emergent insomnia complaints or somnolence during the therapy with vortioxetine is lower when compared to SSRI and SNRI drugs.

### Escitalopram oral (escitalopram oral solution) [^cfe82ccb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Escitalopram

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by the 1428 patients treated with escitalopram for periods of up to one year in double-blind or open-label clinical trials during its premarketing evaluation. The listing does not include those reactions already listed in Tables 2 & 3, those reactions for which a drug cause was remote and at a rate less than 1% or lower than placebo, those reactions which were so general as to be uninformative, and those reactions reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening. Reactions are categorized by body system. Reactions of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section (5).

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^38639a14]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Tolerability

AEs were reported by 135 (53.1%) of young-old patients (n = 254) and 88 (58.3%) of old-old patients (n = 151). Treatment-emergent AEs with an incidence ≥ 5% in either age group that occurred during the open-label period were nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, fatigue, hyperhidrosis and insomnia. The difference by age was statistically significant only for hyperhidrosis [15 (5.9%) versus 2 (1.3%), respectively; p = 0.0372, Fisher's Exact test] and diarrhoea [17 (6.7%) versus 3 (2.0%), respectively; p = 0.0348, Fisher's Exact test]. In almost all cases, spontaneously reported AEs were mild to moderate. There was no significant difference in withdrawal rates due to AEs between age groups (chi-square, χ 2 = 1.669, df = 1, p = 0.196). The most common AEs leading to withdrawal for old-old patients (n = 151) were nausea (14 patients), anxiety (7 patients), and depression (5 patients) compared to nausea (9 patients), anxiety (3 patients), and depression (3 patients), for young-old patients. Of the 21 old-old patients who withdrew due to an AE, there were 19 (out of 100) aged from 75 to 79 years, 2 (out of 39) aged from 80 to 84 years, and 3 (out of 12) aged 85 years or above. Old-old patients had a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) (12 out of 151 patients, 7.9%) than young-old patients (5 out of 254 patients, 2.0%) (Fisher's Exact test, p = 0.008). A 75-year-old man with a possibly-related SAE was hospitalized for 27 days due to anxiety and suicidal ideation and subsequently recovered.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^158e66af]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

SSRIs act by selective blockade of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter, boosting 5-HT neurotransmission and consequently stimulating intestinal transit; however, by not acting on NA receptors, SSRIs do not treat pain. Their primary serotonergic effect, without noradrenergic effect, leads to more significant expected benefits in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic-related behaviors. They can be added to a TCA or SNRI in low doses when anxiety is dominant. Similarly SSRIss may be used instead of a TCA to manage a patient with IBS-C when pain is not dominant. SSRI are more likely to cause diarrhea, while TCAs tend to be constipating due to their NA effect.

The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Although all act on 5-HT reuptake inhibition, each of them has specific pharmacologic properties, like greater 5-HT2C antagonism of fluoxetine and greater anticholinergic action of paroxetine, so unlike the other SSRIs, paroxetine may produce constipation.

Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram tend to have the fewest pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they exhibit minimal effects on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, however, have an increased risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions through their strong inhibition of the P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6; therefore, they should be administered with caution when used in conjunction with TCAs and beta-blockers like metoprolol, opioids, lithium, tryptophan and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

SSRIs are first-line pharmacologic agents for treating anxiety disorders, but they have the potential to induce restlessness and exacerbate anxiety when the drug is initiated. They are typically initiated at half of the usual starting dose to minimize these potential anxiogenic adverse effects. The dose may gradually increase to the regular starting dose after about 1 week (Table 3). The higher effect of the SSRI is usually delayed 3–4 weeks, which may represent a problem for those patients with significant anxiety that is complicating treatment and causing significant functional impairment. A useful strategy for this situation is to schedule a long-acting benzodiazepine to temporarily bridge this lag time and provide symptomatic relief for the patient's anxiety symptoms. The benzodiazepine should then be tapered after about 4 weeks of SSRI treatment.

Other side effects of SSRIs are agitation, sleep disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, night sweats, headache, weight loss, and sexual dysfunction.

2.2 Study treatment and criterion for treatment outcome

The patients with MDD were prescribed to take escitalopram as treatment in the following 12 weeks of longitudinal study. The initial dose of escitalopram was 5 mg/day, and medication doses were adjusted by psychiatrists on the basis of patient response following the recommended range of 10–20 mg/day. Patients with insomnia were allowed to use sedative‐hypnotic drugs. Finally, 20 patients with MDD used sedative‐hypnotic drugs, including 12, three, two, two, and one patient who used lorazepam, zopiclone, oxazepam, zolpidem, and estazolam, respectively.

Treatment remission was the primary outcome in this study, and it was defined as an endpoint HAMD total score ≤ 7 (Williams et al.). In accordance with this criterion, the patients with MDD were classified into two groups: MDDr (endpoint HAMD total score ≤ 7) and MDDnr (endpoint HAMD total score > 7) groups.

2.3 data acquisition

Brain images were acquired using a 3.0 T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner with a 64‐channel radiofrequency head coil at Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University. All the participants were asked not to move their heads in the scanner while being awake and keeping their eyes closed, and they were instructed not to think about anything in particular. Earplugs were provided for the participants to reduce the scanner's noise. Functional images were acquired using the gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging (EPI) sequence, and 200 volumes were collected, with a total scan time of 6 min and 40 s. The scan parameters of the functional images were as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; number of slices = 33, interlaced axial scanning; slice thickness/gap = 3.5/0.7 mm; flip angle (FA) = 90°; matrix = 64 × 64; field of view (FOV) = 200 × 200 mm 2; and voxel size = 3.13 × 3.13 × 4.2 mm 3. T1 structural images were acquired using the magnetization‐prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence, and the scan parameters were as follows: TR = 2530 ms; TE = 1.85 ms; number of sagittal slices = 192; slice thickness = 1 mm; FA = 15°; matrix = 256 × 256; FOV = 256 × 256 mm 2; and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^c613aacc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation — are generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects emerging within the first few weeks and including dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, headache, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, vivid dreams, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, fatigue, nervousness, tremor, bruxism, and diaphoresis; potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior, behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome; it may be helpful when starting a new SSRI to begin with a sub-therapeutic dose to minimize adverse effects, and because early adverse effects and delayed efficacy can prompt discontinuation, it is important to provide education about the time-course of improvement and adverse effects; although SSRIs have a greater margin of safety in overdose than other antidepressants, deaths have been reported after very large ingestions.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Escitalopram oral solution should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adolescents

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution (10 mg/day to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks.

Adults

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram oral solution, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of continuing escitalopram oral solution 10 mg/day or 20 mg/day in adult patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking escitalopram oral solution during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adults

The recommended starting dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

Generalized anxiety disorder is recognized as a chronic condition. The efficacy of escitalopram oral solution in the treatment of GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. The physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Escitalopram Oral Solution

Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram oral solution or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Pain and depression are associated with both physical and mental fatigue independently of comorbidities and medications in primary Sjögren's syndrome [^15346369]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Our data confirm the importance of fatigue symptoms — both mental and physical — to patients with pSS and permit identification of factors contributing to fatigue including other comorbidities and medications associated with drowsiness. Given the wide variety of potential factors contributing to fatigue, we support the view that a multidisciplinary approach is essential for the clinical management of fatigue in pSS.

We observe that many patients with pSS are taking multiple medications and we recommend a medication review be undertaken to identify drowsy medications which could be contributing to fatigue. If these medications are discontinued, then a review should be arranged and if the fatigue does not improve, then treatment of comorbidities should be considered. However, as pain is a major contributor of both mental and physical fatigue, the contribution of some pain-modifying medications may be beneficial, despite their association with drowsiness.
Patients with pSS should be tested for common comorbidities which can contribute to fatigue, including anaemia or hypothyroidism and offered appropriate treatments.
We recommend screening for depression and anxiety and offering patients appropriate interventions to address these symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions (such as talking therapies) may reduce the need for antidepressants and anti-anxiolytics, many of which are associated with drowsiness.
We recommend that patients undergo a more detailed sleep assessment in order to screen for a primary sleep disorder. Patients identified with conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea should be offered assignable causes such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment. Interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) are a first-line treatment for insomnia associated with other medical conditionsand may prove beneficial to patients with pSS.
Patients with pSS should be offered appropriate pain management interventions. If pain is associated with poor sleep, then CBT-I with a pain adjunct has been suggested as a feasible treatment.
Finally, in the absence of good evidence to support effective drug treatments, fatigue interventions in pSS might focus on a multidisciplinary approach incorporating activity management, graded exercise/activity and CBT.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^5d400c0d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies comparing escitalopram with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

The efficacy of escitalopram in MDD has been compared with that of paroxetine in two randomized, double-blind studies. Escitalopram elicited a statistically significant improvement in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-severity (CGI-S) scores following 8 weeks of treatment and, in a subgroup of severely depressed patients, significant improvement in MADRS score was detected at 27 weeks. Furthermore, not only was there an increase in the rate of treatment discontinuations owing to adverse events in paroxetine compared with escitalopram-treated patients, but significantly more patients in the paroxetine group withdrew from the study owing to lack of efficacy.

Only two randomized, double-blind studies compared the efficacy of escitalopram with that of fluoxetine and these studies have reported conflicting results. The study byin Chinese patients showed no significant difference between the two treatments at 8 weeks, although escitalopram was superior with respect to both the 'depressed mood' and 'work and interests' items of the HAM-D scale. The second study, byin elderly patients, suggested that although fluoxetine was significantly less efficacious than both escitalopram and placebo, escitalopram in turn was not superior to placebo. The adverse-event profile of the two antidepressants was similar, but there were a greater number of treatment discontinuations with fluoxetine compared with escitalopram owing to either adverse events or lack of efficacy.

A single study has explored the comparative efficacy of escitalopram and sertraline and found no differences between agents. However, in this study a fixed dose of escitalopram of 10 mg/day, which is the lowest therapeutic dose, was compared with sertraline flexibly dosed across its entire recommended dose range of 50–200 mg/day (mean dose at week 8: 144 mg/day). The similarity in the efficacy of these two antidepressants reported in this clinical study may not, therefore, translate into clinical practice.

### A study of the effects of LY2216684, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of major depression [^e10a559f]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2010). Low credibility.

The current study sought to test the efficacy and safety of the novel selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor LY2216684 compared to placebo in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Escitalopram was used as a control for assay sensitivity. Adult outpatients with MDD, confirmed at screening by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a Self-Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) score of at least 12 and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity Score of at least 4, were randomly assigned to LY2216684 (N = 269), placebo (N = 138), or escitalopram (N = 62). Efficacy, safety, and tolerability outcomes were compared during 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. LY2216684 plasma concentrations were measured. LY2216684 did not show statistically significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo in the primary analysis of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D(17)) total score. Escitalopram demonstrated significant improvement compared to placebo on the HAM-D(17) total score, suggesting adequate assay sensitivity. Both LY2216684 and escitalopram showed statistically significant improvement from baseline on the patient-rated QIDS-SR total score compared to placebo. Headache, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, and insomnia were the most frequently reported adverse events in the LY2216684 group. A 3–6 beats per minute mean increase from baseline in pulse rate was observed in the LY2216684 group. LY2216684 plasma concentrations increased as the dose increased from 3 mg to 12 mg. The results of this initial investigation of LY2216684's efficacy suggest that it may have antidepressant potential. More definitive data to confirm this is necessary. Its safety profile does not preclude further clinical development.

Comorbidities and medications associated with drowsiness

In addition to meeting AECG classification criteria for Sjogren's syndrome, patients in the UKPSSR cohort are an older cohort presenting with relatively complex health needs. The median CPS for the cohort was 6 (IQR: 3–9). Almost one-third of patients with pSS presented with one or more fatigue-related comorbidities. The most commonly reported comorbidity was hypothyroidism, see table 1.

Table 1
Numbers of patients presenting with comorbidities. While 170 patients presented with one and 22 presented with two or more comorbidities, most patients (416) presented with no comorbidities

In addition, 130 patients with pSS were prescribed a number of different drugs associated with drowsiness. The most common drowsiness-associated medications included antidepressants, such as citalopram (18%), amitriptyline (12%) and fluoxetine (11%), or analgesics such as tramadol (13%). Some patients took two or more drowsiness-associated medications, see table 2.

Table 2
Numbers of patients prescribed drowsy medications. While 108 patients took one and 22 took two or more drowsy medications, most patients (478) took no drowsy medications. Of those taking one or more drowsy medications, citalopram, tramadol, amitriptyline, fluoxetine and zopiclone were the most frequently reported

For information, summary statistics are reported separately for four separate subsets of patients: (a) patients with comorbidities associated with drowsiness, (b) patients with medications associated with drowsiness, (c) patients with both comorbidities and medications associated with drowsiness and (d) patients with neither comorbidities nor medications associated with drowsiness, see online supplementary table S2. Note that most patients presented with neither comorbidities nor medications associated with drowsiness. While apparent differences between subsets must be interpreted with caution — see online supplementary appendix — not surprisingly, there were statistically significant differences in both physical and mental PROFAD fatigue scores for patients with comorbidities associated with fatigue or medications associated with drowsiness (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.0001).

Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.

There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with escitalopram treatment.

Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

Vital Sign Changes

Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving escitalopram indicated that escitalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.

Weight Changes

Patients treated with escitalopram in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight.

Adverse events

Adverse events were recorded and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). MedDRA is a multi-axial, five-tiered hierarchical terminology used by regulatory authorities and the biopharmaceutical industry for the coding and classification of adverse events. Adverse events were reported using their highest hierarchical grouping (i.e. system organ classes). Adverse events were determined as related to the study treatments (i.e. potential side effect to study treatment) by the investigator and in line with the study protocol. The terminology was developed and is endorsed by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.

Anxious depression definitions

Syndromal anxious depression

Syndromal anxious depression was defined as a DSM-IV MDD diagnosis and at least one concurrent MINI-Plus identified anxiety disorder, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobia.

HRSD 17 anxious depression

HRSD 17 anxious depression was defined as a DSM-IV MDD diagnosis and a HRSD 17 anxiety/somatization factor score of ≥ 7. The anxiety/somatisation factor was derived from a factor analyses of the HRSD 17 by Cleary and Guy and includes six items: hypochondriasis, insight, general and gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, and psychic and somatic anxiety.

Depression, anxiety, and stress scale

Anxiety was also assessed using the self-rated 42-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 42). DASS 42 item scores range from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time). The 14-item DASS 42 anxiety subscale, used in this study, includes 14 items measuring autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect.

Protocol treatment

Participants were randomized to receive escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR with equal probability. All psychotropic medications (except sleep aids and anxiolytics) were discontinued and washed out prior to baseline assessments. Antidepressants were prescribed and doses were adjusted by the participant's treating physician according to routine clinical practice. Additional medication for associated symptoms (e.g. insomnia) or medication-induced side effects (e.g. nausea) were allowed as they reflect common practice. Any treatment for concurrent general medical conditions, except medications contraindicated with the study-assigned antidepressants, were allowed and recorded.

5.6 Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including escitalopram. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when escitalopram was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Consider discontinuation of escitalopram in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.

Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

5.7 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including escitalopram, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of escitalopram and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

In a study in normal volunteers, escitalopram 10 mg daily did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### An open-label study of adjunctive modafinil in patients with sedation related to serotonergic antidepressant therapy [^87d0d456]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), excessive sleepiness and fatigue not only are major components of the disorder, but also may occur as side effects of antidepressant therapy. In addition, sedation may be a consequence of antidepressant regimens. The novel wake-promoting agent modafinil improves wakefulness and reduces fatigue across a variety of clinical disorders. This study assessed the use of modafinil as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who reported sedation related to serotonergic antidepressant therapy.

Method

Data were collected between September 2001 and December 2003. Twenty men and women with DSM-IV-defined MDD were enrolled in this 3-week, open-label, single-center study. In addition to ongoing and stable treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), clinic patients received modafinil once daily. Efficacy assessments were conducted at 1-week intervals.

Results

Sixteen patients (80%) completed the study. Modafinil plus SSRIs significantly improved overall depressive symptoms, as shown by reductions in mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total scores (p < .001 vs. baseline). Adjunctive modafinil significantly improved subjective estimates of wakefulness on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p < .001, all weeks) and reduced fatigue on the Fatigue Severity Scale (p = .009). At the final visit, modafinil had improved overall health status and health-related quality of life, as shown by significant improvements in mean Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey total scores (p = .007) and in physical health (p = .04) and mental health (p = .006) subscores.

Conclusion

In patients with MDD who experience sedation as a side effect of antidepressant therapy, adjunctive modafinil improved wakefulness and reduced fatigue. Modafinil plus SSRIs also improved mood and quality of life.

### Psychiatric treatment considerations with direct acting antivirals in hepatitis C [^d6c84012]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Anxiety secondary to IFNα can also be treated with antidepressants, which are a first line treatment based upon the limited available literature (Level 4). Escitalopram and citalopram may be beneficial options in treating anxiety disorders in HCV based upon the anecdotal reports of safety in HCV and extrapolation of evidence from non-HCV anxiety treatment guidelines. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of dose-related QT prolongation with citalopram and escitalopram. The maximum recommended dose is citalopram 20 mg per day in patients with hepatic impairment, those 65 years of age or older, patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, or patients who are taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor. In some countries, such as Canada, the maximum recommended dose for escitalopram in patients with hepatic impairment is 10 mg per day due to QT prolongation concerns.

Drug interactions between DAAs and some antidepressants, specifically those affected by CYP 450 interactions of PIs, may lead to clinically significant adverse effects which impact tolerability to therapy for HCV. For example, SSRIs and Selective Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) can be associated with nausea, gastrointestinal upset, sweating and sexual dysfunction, which could emerge with PI related drug interactions.

Specific drug interactions with antidepressants and DAAs are summarized in Table 2. In a single study involving telaprevir, escitalopram area under the curve (AUC) was reduced by 35%, suggesting the need for clinicians to monitor the need for dose optimization on triple therapy. No significant DDI has been observed between escitalopram and boceprevir. Specific antidepressants, for example trazodone, that have a high sedative potential and potential for DDIs with DAAs can lead to increased sedation and may impact overall tolerability and compliance to both agents. Therefore, the selection of antidepressant agents during HCV therapy should include consideration of potential DDIs, in order to avoid possible adverse effects, which may negatively affect HCV antiviral treatment adherence. Clinicians should also be aware that St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P-gp, and is contraindicated with DAAs due to the potential risk for significant reductions in boceprevir or telaprevir concentrations.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of escitalopram and desmethylescitalopram in human milk (see Data). There are reports of excessive sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to escitalopram, through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of escitalopram or its metabolites on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for escitalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from escitalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to escitalopram should be monitored for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

A study of 8 nursing mothers on escitalopram with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg/day showed that exclusively breast-fed infants receive approximately 3.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of escitalopram and 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of desmethylcitalopram.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution have been established in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients with major depressive disorder has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution have not been established in pediatric (younger than 12 years of age) patients with major depressive disorder. In a 24-week, open-label safety study in 118 children (aged 7 to 11 years) who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram oral solution.

Safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram oral solution.

Among the 62 clinical trials with posted results, three studies (SUSTAIN‐2, SUSTAIN‐3, TRANSFORM‐3) evaluated the safety and efficacy of self‐administered esketamine nasal spray in combination with an oral antidepressant (Duloxetine, Escitalopram, Sertraline, or Venlafaxine with extended release). Common treatment‐emergent adverse events (≥ 20%) were headache, dizziness, nausea, dissociation, somnolence, and nasopharyngitis. In SUSTAIN studies (NCT02497287, NCT02782104) mean MADRS total score decreased during the induction phase and this reduction persisted during optimization/maintenance phases. And 35.6% and 46.1% of participants were in remission (MADRS total score ≤ 12) at the induction phase and optimization/maintenance phases, respectively. Cognitive tests did not show clinically significant differences between the age groups. In TRANSFORM‐3 (NCT02422186), a higher percentage of patients in esketamine group achieved both clinical response (23.6%) and remission (15.3%) compared with control group (12.3% and 6.2%, respectively).

### Improved insomnia symptoms and sleep-related next-day functioning in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and insomnia following concomitant zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg and escitalopram treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^24578720]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This investigation was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of zolpidem extended-release in patients with insomnia associated with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Method

Patients (N = 385) received open-label escitalopram 10 mg/d and were randomized to concomitant zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg/night or placebo for 8 weeks (phase 1) in a randomized, parallel-group, multicenter trial. Responders (≥ 50% in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS(17)] score) continued 16 weeks of double-blind treatment (phase 2); escitalopram only was given during a 2-week run-out period. The study was conducted between February 2006 and June 2007. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in subjective total sleep time. Secondary efficacy measures included subjective sleep-onset latency, number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset, sleep quality, sleep-related next-day functioning, HDRS(17), Sleep Impact Scale score, Patient and Clinical Global Impressions of Insomnia Treatment, the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study; sleep measures were also evaluated during the run-out period.

Results

Throughout phase 1, zolpidem extended-release led to significantly greater improvements in total sleep time (P < .0001), wake time after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and sleep quality (P ≤ .0003), and some measures of sleep-related next-day functioning but not in depressive symptoms or quality of life. During phase 2, improvements with the zolpidem extended-release/escitalopram group occurred for total sleep time (significant [P < .05] at weeks 12 and 16), as well as for a few other secondary efficacy measures but not in depressive symptoms or quality of life. The most common adverse events associated with combination treatment included nausea, somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and amnesia.

Conclusions

Zolpidem extended-release administered concomitantly with escitalopram for up to 24 weeks was well tolerated and improved insomnia and some sleep-related next-day symptoms and next-day functioning in patients with MDD but did not significantly augment the antidepressant response of escitalopram.

Trial Registration

clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00296179.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^3c75828a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

From weeks 8 to 24, only nasopharyngitis (escitalopram 3.2% vs comparator 2.9%) and headache (escitalopram 2.5% vs comparator 2.6%) had an incidence ≥ 2%. Importantly, particularly for a treatment used long term in clinical practice, in the heterogeneous patient samples studied, escitalopram was both safe and well tolerated. No new types of adverse events were seen in long-term treatment compared with acute treatment. Furthermore, weight gain, which is frequently cited as reason for non-adherence to long-term SSRI treatment, was not seen after 24 weeks of treatment with escitalopram.

In the same meta-analysis, the safety profile of escitalopram was also compared with other antidepressants, including citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine XR. The withdrawal rate at 8 weeks owing to adverse events was significantly lower for escitalopram compared with both paroxetine and venlafaxine XR, and escitalopram resulted in fewer discontinuation signs and symptoms than paroxetine. The latter finding is mirrored by a study that utilized telephone calls reporting symptoms of antidepressant withdrawal received by the UK national medication helpline between October 1997 and March 2005. Of the total of 1753 calls, 39.4% related to paroxetine, whereas 0.9% related to escitalopram. Furthermore, the numbers of calls relating to symptoms of withdrawal were also high with both venlafaxine XR (14.4%) and citalopram (8.0%) compared with escitalopram. However, it is worthwhile noting that the number of calls relating to symptoms of withdrawal is also dependent on the number of prescriptions written, and the same study reported that a much higher number of prescriptions was dispensed for paroxetine (24.3 million), venlafaxine (12.2 million) and citalopram (19.3 million) compared with escitalopram (1.75 million).

### Escitslopram (escitalopram) [^35dfd8a0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.

There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with escitalopram treatment.

Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

Vital Sign Changes:

Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving escitalopram indicated that escitalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.

Weight Changes:

Patients treated with escitalopram in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight.
