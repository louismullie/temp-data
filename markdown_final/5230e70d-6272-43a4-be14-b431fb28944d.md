## Question

Which of the following represents a liquid biopsy application in oncology: 1) analyzing DNA from tumor tissue, 2) CT DNA from blood to monitor disease status, 3) detecting proteins through IHC in a tumor sample, or 4) using PT scan to determine tumor size?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the following options represents a liquid biopsy application in oncology: analyzing DNA from tumor tissue, CT DNA from blood to monitor disease status, detecting proteins through IHC in a tumor sample, or using PT scan to determine tumor size. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a precise definition of liquid biopsy and its core analytes. Then, I should evaluate each option against that definition, watching for category errors such as tissue-based pathology or imaging. Next, I will verify clinical use-cases like disease monitoring to see which option maps onto accepted indications. Finally, I will double-check there are no edge cases that might blur the categories before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor prematurely: liquid biopsy refers to the analysis of nonsolid biospecimens — most commonly blood, but also other fluids like CSF or urine — to detect tumor-derived analytes such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles, or related biomarkers for applications including molecular profiling, treatment response monitoring, minimal residual disease detection, and recurrence surveillance [^112YHvQq] [^112zaqZN] [^116TFb4P].

> Wait, let me verify the contrast class because this will matter for the distractors: traditional tissue biopsy entails analysis of solid tumor specimens and is distinct from liquid biopsy; the latter is minimally invasive, repeatable, and particularly suited to serial disease monitoring across the cancer continuum, whereas the former is invasive and provides a spatially and temporally limited snapshot [^112YHvQq].

> I will now examine Option 1, "analyzing DNA from tumor tissue". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any form of tissue DNA analysis qualify as liquid biopsy? No; by definition, analysis of DNA extracted from solid tumor tissue is tissue biopsy, not liquid biopsy, so Option 1 does not meet the criterion for a nonsolid biospecimen-based test [^113ttXNj].

> Next, I should review Option 2, "ctDNA from blood to monitor disease status". This directly aligns with canonical liquid biopsy use: blood-derived ctDNA is used in practice for real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, early relapse detection, and longitudinal disease assessment, including emerging applications in minimal residual disease and treatment selection, so this matches both the specimen type and the intended clinical application [^113ttXNj] [^112YHvQq] [^1142MvQN].

> Let me consider Option 3, "detecting proteins through IHC in a tumor sample". I need to ensure I'm not conflating modalities: IHC is performed on tissue sections from solid tumors and is a mainstay of anatomic pathology, not a liquid biopsy; thus, this option is tissue-based biomarker assessment, not analysis of a nonsolid biospecimen.

> I should double-check Option 4, "using PET scan to determine tumor size". Hmm, wait a minute — imaging modalities like PET are distinct from molecular liquid biopsy; while radiomics and liquid biopsy can be complementary in practice, imaging is not an analysis of body fluids and therefore does not qualify as a liquid biopsy approach [^112PRHEV] [^112Q6m8u].

> But wait, what if there are edge cases where non-blood fluids could blur the boundaries? Even considering CSF-derived cfDNA/ctDNA in neuro-oncology, the unifying feature remains analysis of a nonsolid biospecimen for tumor-derived material, reinforcing that only the blood ctDNA monitoring option satisfies the liquid biopsy definition among the choices presented [^114b4ywT] [^116TFb4P].

> Conclusion after cross-checking: Option 2 — using ctDNA from blood to monitor disease status — is the correct and only choice that fits the accepted definition and clinical applications of liquid biopsy in oncology, consistent with high-quality evidence and consensus reviews [^113ttXNj] [^112YHvQq] [^1142MvQN].

---

The liquid biopsy application in oncology is **option 2**, which analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) [^112YHvQq] from blood to monitor disease status. Liquid biopsy is a **minimally invasive, blood-based test** [^113it6ds] that detects tumor-derived genetic material [^1111XP4u], enabling real-time treatment monitoring [^112zaqZN], minimal residual disease detection [^116cMAJS], and early identification of resistance mutations [^113ttXNj]. Options 1 and 3 are tissue-based, and option 4 is imaging-based; **none are liquid biopsy methods** [^112Q6m8u].

---

## Definition and clinical applications of liquid biopsy

Liquid biopsy refers to analyzing tumor-derived material in blood or other body fluids [^1111XP4u] — most commonly **ctDNA** [^112zaqZN] — to provide molecular insights into cancer without invasive procedures [^113L2fuM]. Key clinical applications include:

- **Monitoring disease status**: Tracking tumor burden and treatment response through serial ctDNA measurements [^112zaqZN] [^116k5ppH].

- **Detecting minimal residual disease (MRD)**: Identifying residual cancer after treatment to enable early intervention [^116cMAJS] [^116LRKCf] [^1111XP4u].

- **Identifying resistance mutations**: Detecting emerging resistance to guide therapy adjustments [^113ttXNj] [^114VyyHi] [^112YHvQq].

---

## Comparison of the provided options

| **Option** | **Description** | **Liquid biopsy?** | **Clinical application** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Analyzing DNA from tumor tissue | No | Tissue-based genetic profiling |
| 2 | Analyzing ctDNA from blood [^113it6ds] | Yes | - Monitoring disease status <br/> - MRD detection <br/> - Resistance mutation identification |
| 3 | Detecting proteins through IHC in tumor sample | No | Tissue-based protein expression analysis |
| 4 | Using PET scan to determine tumor size | No | Imaging-based tumor size assessment |

---

Option 2 is the **only true liquid biopsy method**, providing a minimally invasive approach to monitor disease status and guide treatment decisions [^1142MvQN].

---

## Advantages of liquid biopsy over traditional methods

Liquid biopsy offers **several advantages** over traditional tissue biopsies and imaging techniques [^1111XP4u] [^112YHvQq]:

- **Minimally invasive**: Reduces patient discomfort and risk compared to surgical biopsies [^113it6ds] [^113L2fuM].

- **Real-time monitoring**: Enables frequent sampling to track tumor dynamics and treatment response [^112zaqZN] [^116k5ppH].

- **Detection of tumor heterogeneity**: Captures genetic diversity across primary and metastatic sites [^112nuMR5].

- **Early detection of resistance**: Identifies resistance mutations before clinical progression [^113ttXNj] [^114VyyHi].

---

## Limitations and challenges of liquid biopsy

Despite its advantages, **liquid biopsy has limitations** [^113ye9kQ]:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Low ctDNA levels in early-stage cancers can limit detection accuracy [^111tEPj4] [^1142MvQN].

- **Standardization**: Variability in pre-analytical and analytical methods requires standardization [^112w2tng] [^117R8iJd].

- **Clinical validation**: Ongoing studies are needed to establish clinical utility across cancer types [^116qXquJ] [^112YHvQq].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines increasingly recognize **liquid biopsy** as a valuable tool in oncology [^1142MvQN]. The **National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)** recommends it for molecular profiling and monitoring in certain cancers, and the **American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)** supports its use for detecting resistance mutations and monitoring disease progression.

---

## Future directions and emerging trends

The field of liquid biopsy is **rapidly evolving**, with trends such as multi-analyte assays that combine ctDNA with other biomarkers (e.g. exosomes, CTCs) to improve accuracy [^113hhVQT] [^112QuCii] [^112YHvQq]. Efforts also focus on developing highly sensitive assays for early-stage cancer detection and integrating liquid biopsy data into personalized treatment strategies [^1111XP4u] [^113KcbyR] [^114FeiZC].

---

Option 2 — blood-based ctDNA analysis — represents the **liquid biopsy application in oncology**. This minimally invasive approach enables real-time monitoring, MRD detection, and early identification of resistance mutations to support personalized cancer care [^112zaqZN].

Techniques for analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect, characterize, and monitor cancer have matured rapidly. An increasing body of clinical evidence is demonstrating the capabilities of this technology as a diagnostic test. The full potential of ctDNA liquid biopsy in the diagnosis, characterization, and management of solid and hematological malignancies will be uncovered through interventional clinical trials evaluating clinical utility. In this review, we discuss the landscape of ctDNA liquid-biopsy applications across the cancer continuum and highlight opportunities for clinical investigation.

### Liquid biopsy: From discovery to clinical application [^112YHvQq]. Cancer Discovery (2021). High credibility.

Over the past 10 years, circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have received enormous attention as new biomarkers and subjects of translational research. Although both biomarkers are already used in numerous clinical trials, their clinical utility is still under investigation, with promising first results. Clinical applications include early cancer detection, improved cancer staging, early detection of relapse, real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, and detection of therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms.

Here, we propose a conceptual framework of CTC and ctDNA assays and point out challenges of CTC and ctDNA research, which might structure this dynamic field of translational cancer research. The significance of this development is that the analysis of blood for CTCs or cell-free nucleic acids, called "liquid biopsy", has opened new avenues for cancer diagnostics. This includes early detection of tumors, improved risk assessment and staging, as well as early detection of relapse and monitoring of tumor evolution in the context of cancer therapies.

### Liquid biopsy enters the clinic - implementation issues and future challenges [^113ttXNj]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Historically, studies of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow and circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood have provided crucial insights into cancer biology and the metastatic process. More recently, advances in the detection and characterization of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have finally enabled the introduction of liquid biopsy assays into clinical practice. The FDA has already approved several single-gene assays and, more recently, multigene assays to detect genetic alterations in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for use as companion diagnostics matched to specific molecularly targeted therapies for cancer. These approvals mark a tipping point for the widespread use of liquid biopsy in the clinic, mostly in patients with advanced-stage cancer.

The next frontier for the clinical application of liquid biopsy is likely to be the systemic treatment of patients with 'ctDNA relapse', a term we introduce for ctDNA detection prior to imaging-detected relapse after curative-intent therapy for early-stage disease. Cancer screening and diagnosis are other potential future applications. In this Perspective, we discuss key issues and gaps in technology, clinical trial methodologies, and logistics for the eventual integration of liquid biopsy into the clinical workflow.

### Minimum technical data elements for liquid biopsy data submitted to public databases [^117R8iJd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsies are samples of nonsolid biospecimens, such as blood, that may be used for molecular or cellular analysis. These biospecimens offer several important clinical benefits compared to more traditionally obtained single-site biopsies. First, they are safer. Second, they are more likely to be representative of molecular alterations present from multiple metastatic sites. Third, they involve ease of acquisition on a repeated basis to monitor disease over time with limited patient risk. As a result, this mode of sample acquisition and analysis has become a top priority for diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, who are looking for translational approaches focused on developing liquid biopsy biomarkers to guide treatment selection, assess treatment efficacy, and understand mechanisms of acquired resistance after an initial response to therapy.

Additional advantages of a liquid biopsy-based testing approach include specimen availability within a routine clinical practice setting, the ability to control most, if not all, preanalytical steps, and the potential for short turnaround times to inform medical decision-making.

One of the principles adopted by the BloodPAC members was that not only should the consortium be data-driven, but it should also create a data resource for the liquid biopsy community. BloodPAC has developed such a resource called the BloodPAC Data Commons, which follows the principles that its data be FAIR (findable, attributable, interoperable, and reusable).

### Promises and pitfalls of using liquid biopsy for precision medicine [^113ye9kQ]. Cancer Research (2019). Low credibility.

New sensitive assays are currently available for the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC). However, there remains a need for standardization of preanalytical issues and cross-platform comparison studies. Liquid biopsies are being evaluated for treatment selection, for monitoring disease response and resistance, for tracking minimal residual disease, and for cancer diagnosis.

Multiple studies are underway to assess the clinical utility of CTC and ctDNA in different settings, including treatment-naïve vs. resistant and adjuvant vs. metastatic, as well as for different treatment modalities such as systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. This review aims to map the challenges that remain to be addressed before liquid biopsies can be widely used for cancer management.

### Current and future clinical applications of ctDNA in immuno-oncology [^1172KxzC]. Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, the identification of molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells hamper immunity marked the beginning of a new era in the management of cancer patients. Since the first immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) approval in unresectable malignant melanoma, up to 15 different clinical entities, including both solid and hematologic malignancies, have benefited from an FDA-approved indication for ICI-based treatment. The field of applications for ICIs is rapidly evolving. Notably, the repertoire of immune-oncology (IO) therapeutic options is constantly expanding by targeting additional immune checkpoints or costimulatory molecules, combining ICIs with other therapeutic strategies, and introducing innovative approaches based on T-cell bioengineering.

Early identification of relapse and early therapeutic intervention are essential determinants for improved overall survival. However, an objective biomarker associated with the efficacy of IO drugs is an urgent but still unmet clinical need.

The past decade has also seen the advent of liquid biopsy. Contrary to tumor tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy gives access to tumor material in a minimally invasive way, offering patients a more acceptable, safer, and easily repeatable option to monitor tumor response. Liquid biopsy applies to detecting tumor cells or tumor-derived products like tumor DNA, referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is mainly shed in peripheral blood and other body fluids. The field of ctDNA clinical applications is mainly based on mutation detection and has greatly benefited from significant advancements.

### The coming of age of liquid biopsy in neuro-oncology [^114b4ywT]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

The clinical role of liquid biopsy in oncology is growing significantly. In gliomas and other brain tumors, targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may aid in differential diagnosis when surgery is not recommended and may be more representative of tumor heterogeneity than surgical specimens, unveiling targetable genetic alterations. Given the invasive nature of lumbar puncture to obtain CSF, the quantitative analysis of cfDNA in plasma is a promising option for patient follow-up. Confounding factors may include cfDNA variations due to concomitant pathologies such as inflammatory diseases or seizures and clonal hematopoiesis.

Pilot studies suggest that methylome analysis of cfDNA from plasma and the temporary opening of the blood-brain barrier by ultrasound have the potential to overcome some of these limitations. An increased understanding of mechanisms modulating the shedding of cfDNA by the tumor may help to decrypt the meaning of cfDNA kinetics in blood or CSF.

Emerging techniques: The liquid biopsy

Peripheral blood samples are a biomarker source by way of circulating tumor cells (DNA) and circulating nucleic acids or associated extracellular vesicles or exosomes. The use of liquid biopsy profiling has proven useful in selected clinical scenarios; however, at the time of writing, despite its potential in the management of patients with most metastatic solid tumors, this technique has not established a firm role in standard practice. Obvious advantages include ease of access to the tissue through a simple blood draw. An additional advantage is that circulating samples may help reduce the problem of tumor heterogeneity as they reflect the sum total of the tumor. However, when blood and tumor tissue are concurrently collected and analyzed, results from circulating tumor cell analyses do not always match those obtained from tumor tissue analyses and thus are not always reliable.

- **Extracellular vesicles or exosomes**: A newly developed, minimally invasive ADAPT Biotargeting System characterizes complex biological systems in their inherent states and relies on the fact that a large number of cells in the body secrete extracellular vesicles into the circulation. The molecular composition of these "exosomes" correlates with the cell of origin. Through intercellular communication, exosomes play a part in controlling many tumor progressive processes, including immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The ADAPT assay has been shown to have potential for biomarker identification and therapeutic application.

### Novel markers for liquid biopsies in cancer management: circulating platelets and extracellular vesicles [^112QuCii]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Although radiologic imaging and histologic assessment of tumor tissues are classic approaches for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response, they have many limitations. These include challenges in distinguishing benign from malignant masses, difficult access to the tumor, high cost of the procedures, and tumor heterogeneity. In this setting, liquid biopsy has emerged as a potential alternative for both diagnostic and monitoring purposes. The approaches to liquid biopsy include cell-free DNA/circulating tumor DNA, long and micro noncoding RNAs, proteins/peptides, carbohydrates/lectins, lipids, and metabolites. Other approaches include detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells, extracellular vesicles, and tumor-activated platelets. Ultimately, reliable use of liquid biopsies requires bioinformatics and statistical integration of multiple datasets to achieve approval in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments setting. This review provides a balanced and critical assessment of recent discoveries regarding tumor-derived biomarkers in liquid biopsies, along with the potential and pitfalls for cancer detection and longitudinal monitoring.

### Application of liquid biopsies in cancer targeted therapy [^1175WMhR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

As a growing body of evidence demonstrates intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, both during carcinogenesis and throughout treatment, resulting in acquired drug resistance, the utility of blood-based assays, or "liquid biopsies", is becoming increasingly recognized in clinical practice and trial design. "Liquid biopsies" provide a less invasive approach compared to the gold standard of interrogating tumors by tissue biopsies, which are frequently unfeasible, associated with morbidity, and cannot be performed as often.

### Liquid biopsies come of age: Towards implementation of circulating tumour DNA [^112nuMR5]. Nature Reviews. Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Improvements in genomic and molecular methods are expanding the range of potential applications for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), both in a research setting and as a 'liquid biopsy' for cancer management. Proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated the translational potential of ctDNA for prognostication, molecular profiling, and monitoring. The field is now in an exciting transitional period where ctDNA analysis is beginning to be applied clinically, although there is still much to learn about the biology of cell-free DNA. This is an opportune time to appraise potential approaches to ctDNA analysis and consider their applications in personalized oncology and cancer research.

### Emerging concepts in liquid biopsies [^114Qb9tB]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

As the concept of precision medicine in the field of cancer management continues to evolve, so too do the challenges and demands with regards to diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment resistance. Although the discovery of molecular agents able to target specific genomic changes in metastatic cancer patients has revolutionized patient care, tumor heterogeneity remains a daunting obstacle for clinicians who need to optimize therapy regimens based on an individual's cancer genome.

Tissue biopsies, which still currently represent the standard of tumor diagnosis, unfortunately only reflect a single point in time of a single site of the tumor. Such a sampling method is inadequate for the comprehensive characterization of a patient's tumor, as it has been demonstrated that various areas within the primary tumor or metastases can harbor different genomic profiles. The molecular genetic diversity within a tumor can also alter over time, rendering future treatment decisions based on historical biopsy information potentially inaccurate and suboptimal. Furthermore, a surgical biopsy procedure is hampered by limited repeatability, patient age and comorbidity, costs, and time, potentially leading to clinical complications.

Despite these ongoing clinical issues, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has proven its value in the search for novel, more comprehensive, and less invasive biomarkers to truly realize the goals of cancer precision medicine. Such minimally invasive tests, known as "liquid biopsies", have gained prominence as a potential solution to these challenges.

### Radiomics and liquid biopsy in oncology: The holons of systems medicine [^112PRHEV]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Radiomics is a process of extraction and analysis of quantitative features from diagnostic images. Liquid biopsy is a test performed on a sample of blood to detect cancer cells or fragments of tumorigenic DNA circulating in the blood. Radiomics and liquid biopsy have great potential in oncology, as both are minimally invasive, easy to perform, and can be repeatedly used in patient follow-up visits. This capability allows the extraction of valuable information regarding tumor type, aggressiveness, progression, and response to treatment. Both methods are in their early stages, with significant evidence of application in lung and gastrointestinal cancer, while still undergoing evaluation in other cancer types. This paper reviews the main oncologic applications of radiomics and liquid biopsy and discusses a synergistic approach incorporating both tests for cancer diagnosis and follow-up within the context of systems medicine.

- **Teaching points**: Radiomics is a process of extraction and analysis of quantitative features from diagnostic images. Most clinical applications of radiomics are in the field of oncologic imaging. Radiomics applies to all imaging modalities. A cluster of radiomic features is a "radiomic signature". Machine learning may improve the efficacy of radiomics analysis.

### The utility of liquid biopsies in radiation oncology [^115fkQdY]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2020). Low credibility.

Use of therapeutic radiation is primarily guided by clinicopathologic factors and medical imaging, whereas molecular biomarkers currently play a comparatively minor role in most settings. Liquid biopsies provide a rich source of noninvasive tumor-specific biomarkers and are amenable to repeated and noninvasive assessment. Here, we review the status of liquid biopsies and their potential impact on the field of radiation oncology.

- **Established and emerging approaches**: We focus on established and emerging approaches to analyze circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood. These promising classes of biomarkers could have an outsized impact on cancer management by meaningfully stratifying patients into risk groups, tracking radiation therapy efficacy during and after treatment, and identifying patients with radiosensitive or radioresistant disease.

- **Opportunities for future investigation**: Finally, we highlight opportunities for future investigation, including the need for prospective interventional studies employing liquid biopsies to guide the management of radiation therapy-treated patients.

### Emerging concepts in liquid biopsies [^116q92Cq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cancer is a complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic disease involving multiple gene-environment interactions and affecting numerous biological pathways. As such, the development of reliable and robust non-invasive platforms represents a vital step towards the promise of precision medicine. Work in the liquid biopsy field continues to show great potential utility in the diagnosis and stratification of cancer patients and further exemplifies a surrogate method for monitoring treatment response compared to the tissue biopsy approach.

The ease and frequency made possible by serial liquid biopsy collection offer several advantages compared to standard surgical procedures, including the opportunity for more rapid course correction of administered therapies. As technological advances continue and further innovations in liquid biopsy methodology arise in parallel, this approach will hopefully enable methods for the pre-diagnostic assessment of cancer risk as well. As our knowledge of the biology behind cfDNA improves, so too will the management of cancer patients as the liquid biopsy method becomes a clinical reality.

### Emerging concepts in liquid biopsies [^111Hv4TD]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Characterizing and monitoring tumor genomes with blood samples could achieve significant improvements in precision medicine. As tumors shed parts of themselves into circulation, analyses of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and tumor-derived exosomes — often referred to as "liquid biopsies" — may enable tumor genome characterization by minimally invasive means. Indeed, multiple studies have described how molecular information about parent tumors can be extracted from these components. Here, we briefly summarize technologies and then elaborate on emerging novel concepts that may further propel the field. We address normal and detectable mutation levels in the context of our knowledge regarding the gradual accumulation of mutations during aging and in light of technological limitations. Finally, we discuss whether liquid biopsies are ready to be used in routine clinical practice.

### Potential clinical utility of liquid biopsy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^115qCxnY]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Lung cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in 2020, with an estimated 2.2 million new cancer cases and 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Approximately 60% of lung cancer patients have distant metastasis at the initial diagnosis, and a substantial number of patients still progress to local recurrence or distant metastasis after curative-intent treatment. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been suggested for lung cancer screening, with a significant relative reduction in mortality for lung cancer patients. However, distinguishing small malignant nodules in LDCT from benign lesions is particularly challenging due to the high false-positive rate. In practice, a significant proportion of patients still suffer from ambiguous disease progression during radiological follow-up after radical surgery. Presently, the prognostic stratification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using factors such as tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification, airway spread, and pathological subtype has shown limited effectiveness, with some low-risk patients experiencing postoperative relapse. Therefore, more effective approaches and biomarkers will contribute to early detection, precision medicine, individualized treatment, and prognostication of lung cancer, and they are urgently needed.

Recently, with the advantages of noninvasiveness, ease of access, reproducibility, good reflection of the overall state of the tumor, and real-time surveillance, liquid biopsy has been widely researched and has shown promising efficacy in early detection and management of lung cancer.

### The coming of age of liquid biopsy in neuro-oncology [^116JWSkv]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

The challenges of liquid biopsy in neuro-oncology are noteworthy. In the late 1970s, evidence showed that cancer patients have higher levels of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma compared to healthy subjects. It was subsequently demonstrated that part of this cfDNA is tumour-derived and could be used for the non-invasive detection of cancer mutations, coining the term 'liquid biopsy' for the non-invasive assessment of tumour genetic profiles using tumour-derived nucleic acids.

In the past decade, liquid biopsies have been increasingly utilized for response assessment, early detection of treatment resistance, prognostic prediction, and treatment decisions, complementing or even replacing tissue biopsies in precision oncology. This is supported by the validation of commercial assays of liquid biopsy for clinical use. In colon cancer, tumour cfDNA-guided approaches successfully reduced adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival. In a prospective study of 1,127 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the detection of tumour cfDNA was linked to shorter survival. Therapeutic targets identified through sequencing of cfDNA provided a survival advantage, and mutations specific to cfDNA were discovered in a quarter of cases, indicating subclonal resistance drivers.

Due to anatomical barriers like the blood-brain barrier, which are only partially disrupted by tumours, plasma-based liquid biopsy presents a greater challenge in neuro-oncology. Among patients with gliomas, fewer than 10% had plasma-derived tumour-derived cfDNA, whereas 74–100% had CSF-derived tumour-derived cfDNA.

### Recent advances in circulating nucleic acids in oncology [^112zaqZN]. Annals of Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting areas in oncology in recent years. Its potential clinical uses now cover each phase of cancer patient management care, including predictive information, detection of minimal residual disease, early detection of resistance, treatment monitoring, recurrence surveillance, and cancer early detection/screening. This review discusses the recent advances in applying circulating DNA or RNA in oncology, building on unpublished or initial findings presented at the 10th International Symposium on Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum, held in Montpellier from September 20th to 22nd, 2017.

During the symposium, presenters revealed their latest data and crucial observations, notably in relation to:

- **Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) structure**: Implications regarding optimal detection.
- **Role in metastatic or immunological processes**: Understanding cfDNA's involvement.
- **Evaluation of miRNA panels**: For cancer patient follow-up.
- **Detection of minimal residual disease**: Recent progress in methodologies.
- **Screening tests for cancer**: Using cfDNA analysis.
- **Preanalytical guidelines**: Essential elements for cfDNA handling and analysis.

This work reviews the recent progresses in the field, as highlighted at the meeting, as well as the most significant reports from the literature, both past and present. It proposes a broader picture of the basic research, its potential, and the implementation and challenges in the use of circulating nucleic acids in oncology.

### Application of liquid biopsies in cancer targeted therapy [^115eY6Ab]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Circulating biomarkers may aid diagnosis, prognostication, identify minimal residual disease, and allow disease molecular characterization. Serial sample analyses can facilitate response assessment, clonal evolution, and studies of therapeutic resistance. Circulating tumor cells and cfDNA are complementary noninvasive approaches for such biomarker studies. We envision that rigorous validation, including healthy volunteer blood analysis studies and prospective clinical trials for clinical qualification, will allow these biomarkers to transform cancer care.

### Minimal residual disease as a target for liquid biopsy in patients with solid tumours [^116cMAJS]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death in patients with solid tumours. Imaging technologies are not sufficiently sensitive to detect minimal residual disease (MRD; also known as measurable or molecular residual disease) after initial surgery or chemotherapy, pointing to the need for more sensitive tests to detect remaining traces of cancer in the body. Liquid biopsy, or the analysis of tumour-derived or tumour-induced cells or cellular products in the blood or other body fluids, has opened a new diagnostic avenue to detect and monitor MRD.

Liquid biopsy is already used in clinical decision-making for patients with haematological malignancies. Here, we review knowledge on the use of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to detect and monitor MRD in patients with solid tumours. We also discuss how ctDNA-guided MRD detection and characterization could herald a new era of novel 'post-adjuvant therapies' with the potential to eliminate MRD and cure patients before terminal metastatic disease is evident on imaging.

### Clinical relevance of extracellular vesicles in hematological neoplasms: from liquid biopsy to cell biopsy [^113hhVQT]. Leukemia (2021). High credibility.

In the era of precision medicine, liquid biopsy is becoming increasingly important in oncology. It involves the isolation and analysis of tumor-derived biomarkers, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), in body fluids. EVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed particles that are heterogeneous in size and molecular composition, released from both normal and neoplastic cells. In the context of tumors, EVs are valuable carriers of cancer information; their amount, phenotype, and molecular cargo — including proteins, lipids, metabolites, and nucleic acids — mirror the nature and origin of parental cells, rendering EVs as appealing candidates for novel biomarkers. The translation of these potential diagnostic tools into clinical practice could profoundly revolutionize the cancer field, mainly for solid tumors, but also for hematological neoplasms.

### Utility of circulating tumor DNA in cancer diagnostics with emphasis on early detection [^114PDfxK]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests for early diagnosis involve the performance of ultra-deep sequencing of DNA fragments isolated from plasma/serum (liquid biopsy) to identify fragments with mutations characteristic of malignant cells. These mutant fragments or mutations are considered unique to malignancy and are not likely to be found in the plasma of normal individuals, which qualifies them as ideal tumor markers. Alongside these mutated fragments, the plasma is expected to have otherwise identical but non-mutated fragments originating from normal tissues (cfDNA).

Here, for the sake of discussion, we have assumed that the sample contains a variable mixture of normal and mutant alleles and that the rate of release of these fragments into the circulation is mostly determined by the mass or volume of the tissues, irrespective of their malignant or normal status. Similar calculations could be made using other hypothetical scenarios, such as the fact that DNA release is ten times more efficient from tumors compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, we roughly estimated the expected ratio of mutant to normal alleles based on empirical findings from the literature.

To screen for a variety of cancers, the tests would need to simultaneously identify a large number (i.e. 50–500 or more) of cancer-associated mutations in plasma. Thus, we assumed that the detection of one mutation would lead to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, which represents the best-case scenario. Sensitivity and specificity are addressed further on.

### Clinical application of circulating tumour DNA in colorectal cancer [^111zojKD]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsies that detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) have the potential to revolutionize the personalized management of colorectal cancer. For patients with early-stage disease, emerging clinical applications include the assessment of molecular residual disease after surgery, the monitoring of adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy, and early detection of recurrence during surveillance. In the advanced disease setting, data highlight the potential of ctDNA levels as a prognostic marker and as an early indicator of treatment response. ctDNA assessment can complement standard tissue-based testing for molecular characterization, with the added ability to monitor emerging mutations under the selective pressure of targeted therapy. Here, we provide an overview of the evidence supporting the use of ctDNA in colorectal cancer, the studies underway to address some of the outstanding questions, and the barriers to widespread clinical uptake.

### Application of liquid biopsies in cancer targeted therapy [^114voW73]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

As a growing body of evidence demonstrates intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, both during carcinogenesis and throughout treatment resulting in acquired drug resistance, the utility of blood-based assays or "liquid biopsies" is becoming increasingly recognized in clinical practice and trial design. "Liquid biopsies" provide a less invasive approach to the gold standard of interrogating tumors by tissue biopsies, which are frequently unfeasible, associated with morbidity, and cannot be performed as often.

### Liquid biopsy in hepatocellular carcinoma: ctDNA as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis [^113S4V6Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

Liquid biopsy is an emerging non-invasive technique with transformative potential in early cancer diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, assessing treatment response, predicting recurrence, and determining prognosis. As much of the evidence on liquid biopsy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently based on short-term studies, there is a need for more longitudinal data. Recent technological advancements may provide continued long-term investigations on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is crucial for understanding its significance in cancer.

The US National Laboratory of Medicine is currently conducting a clinical trial (NCT02838836) to evaluate the efficacy of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and ctDNA in monitoring disease progression and treatment response in patients with solid cancers, including HCC. Among the many advantages of liquid biopsy, the analysis of epigenetic biomarkers in ctDNA holds particular promise for tracing the tissue of origin, thereby providing critical insights for cancer diagnosis. DNA methylation is the most frequently utilized epigenetic modification for altering ctDNA, as it displays highly tissue-specific effects that can be used to trace the original source of the tumor. Furthermore, deep sequencing of ctDNA can reveal nucleosome positioning and fragment-end patterns, providing additional clues about the tissue of origin.

Beyond cancer diagnosis, liquid biopsy, particularly ctDNA analysis, offers great potential for classifying molecular subtypes of malignancies. For instance, plasma ctDNA has been used to classify transcriptionally defined subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

### Liquid biopsy technique may allow early screening [^1122vzmm]. Cancer Discovery (2017). Low credibility.

Researchers have developed a new liquid biopsy technique that may allow screening for certain types of cancer. The technique can detect tumor mutations from the small amount of blood DNA present early in the disease. In four types of cancer, the technique's overall sensitivity was between 56% and 83%, and it could pinpoint 62% of patients with early-stage cancer.

### Liquid biopsy-based precision therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors: A real-world experience from a community-based oncology practice [^116whYRb]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Precision oncology relies on the identification of molecular abnormalities through molecular profiling of an individual patient's tumor and matching actionable mutations to specific target-based therapeutic agents when available. While gold standard profiling has traditionally been based on resected or biopsied tumor material, recent years have witnessed the development of liquid biopsy (LBx) assays that allow early, timely, and minimally invasive testing for circulating genetic material in the blood, including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

Compared to traditional cancer tissue biopsy, LBx is less invasive and more comprehensive for evaluating tumor heterogeneity because all tumor sites release ctDNA into the blood. Facilitated by the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, ctDNA sequencing can achieve much higher sensitivity than tissue biopsy and can be used for different applications, including early screening and diagnosis, treatment selection, and detection of residual disease and recurrence.

In terms of enhancing molecular profiling and increasing target-matched therapeutic options, there is evidence that higher matching results in improved disease control rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates. LBx is uniquely placed to capture changes in the molecular landscape of a specific patient over time and thus enhance molecular profiling and subsequently target-to-therapy matching rates. This is due to the capability of LBx to detect tumor heterogeneity within both primary and metastatic tumor sites.

### Emerging proximal liquid biopsy approaches for detecting residual disease and predicting recurrence in head and neck cancer: A review and proposal of novel liquid staging [^112Jz7nf]. Head & neck (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a significant global health challenge, accounting for approximately 4% of all cancers worldwide. In the United States, an estimated 58,450 new cases of oral cavity and pharynx cancers are projected in 2024. Despite advances in treatment modalities, HNSCC remains difficult to manage due to its high rates of recurrence and limited improvement in survival outcomes. Recurrent and metastatic HNSCC are particularly associated with poor prognosis, with a median survival time ranging from 6 to 15 months. Thus, earlier detection of recurrence is critical, as timely interventions such as salvage surgery or re-irradiation can significantly improve survival.

Despite ongoing research into improved surveillance methods, clinical practice for detecting residual disease and subsequent recurrence still relies heavily on traditional approaches such as imaging, biopsies, postoperative surgical pathology, and clinical evaluations. While these methods remain integral to patient management, they have significant limitations. These methods can be invasive and inconsistent in detecting small residual tumors or early relapses, particularly for tumors in less accessible anatomic locations. This underscores the need for more sensitive diagnostic tools to identify postoperative residual disease and predict recurrence.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection via liquid biopsy has emerged as a potentially valuable complementary tool to traditional diagnostic and surveillance methods in cancer care. By analyzing biofluids, liquid biopsies offer a less invasive means to effectively identify postoperative residual disease and predict recurrence.

### The role of liquid biopsy in the management of patients with genitourinary malignancies [^115f3dAW]. European Urology (2025). High credibility.

Liquid biopsy testing refers to the use of specific analytical methods to detect disease-related biomarkers in blood or its components. These tests can be either qualitative or quantitative. Liquid biopsy testing is increasingly used in patient care. Here, we explore all the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for liquid biopsies related to genitourinary oncology. The secondary objective is to describe a few other potential uses of this technology that may become approved soon.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of all FDA approvals from 2015 through 2025. We interrogated multiple FDA databases to capture both tumor-specific and tissue-agnostic approvals. We limited the search to indications related to or requiring biomarker testing to assess the value of liquid biopsy testing. A total of 1119 approvals were identified. Of these, nine unique drug approvals related to genitourinary cancers require molecular testing. We identified the registrational trials used for those approvals through PubMed and present the results here. For the secondary endpoints, we identified examples published within the past 10 years.

- **Key findings and limitations**: The use of liquid biopsy testing based on regulatory approval is for predicting treatment response. There are nine FDA-approved drugs or drug combinations applicable to clinical practice for patients with genitourinary malignancies. Liquid biopsy testing is currently available to identify patients for most of these indications. We highlight the limitations associated with these findings.

### Measure twice: Promise of liquid biopsy in pediatric high-grade gliomas [^112ME5TQ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Measures of disease status must capture more than anatomic presence, and those capable of assessing pathophysiologic evolution of disease hold the potential to better inform the care of patients with pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG). The liquid biome, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, provides a rich, noninvasive biosource to interrogate for tumor-associated biomaterials. Biomaterials, such as tumor-associated proteins, nucleic acids, exosomes, and cells, hold the potential to act as analytes for disease diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic prediction, treatment monitoring, and recurrence surveillance.

Robust discovery and exploratory liquid biopsy investigations are ongoing in the adult setting, and emerging work is underway in the pediatric sphere, as reviewed by Bonner et al. To advance the care of patients with pHGG, the field must leverage advancing detection technologies to develop sensitive circulating disease analytes that are highly tumor-specific and clinically actionable. Herein, the progress toward liquid biopsy in pHGG is critically reviewed and compared with liquid biopsy in adult high-grade glioma.

- **Protein biomarkers**: Protein biomarkers are distinct intact peptides that can be differentially regulated in the setting of disease, including alterations in secretion, shedding, and loss from cells. They are detected in blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid. Generally stable, these peptides can provide an objective, quantitative, and noninvasive measure of disease. The first biomarker was reported in 184.

### Beyond the snapshot: Optimizing prognostication and prediction by moving from fixed to functional multidimensional cancer pathology [^1138WYMg]. The Journal of Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsy-based biomarkers, including circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) assays, have attracted a great deal of attention over the last decade following success in lung cancer. These assays show great promise in the temporal monitoring of tumours, regardless of clinical scenario (primary tumour, recurrence, metastasis, or resistance). The clinical applications of liquid biopsies include, but are not restricted to, early detection, monitoring of tumour dynamics, and identifying tumours with a high risk of recurrence. Beyond lung cancer, studies have also demonstrated the role of liquid biopsies in the clinical care of female cancers, particularly breast cancer.

In recent years, multiple large pooled analyses have investigated the prognostic value of CTCs in stage I–III and stage IV breast cancer. Three meta-analyses have now reported a strong association between CTC and overall survival. Compared to CTC-based studies, the prognostic relevance of ctDNA-based studies is less clear-cut. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis that included patients from multiple trials with variable, mostly nonmetastatic disease (stage I–IV), found an association between ctDNA and overall survival. Interestingly, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) recommends molecular analysis of a liquid biopsy in nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients with acquired resistance to a targeted inhibitor when a tissue biopsy is not possible. The prognostic relevance of liquid-biopsy biomarkers in endometrial and ovarian cancer seems to be less prominent.

### The current state of molecular testing in the treatment of patients with solid tumors, 2019 [^112j7cia]. CA (2019). Low credibility.

In 2019, optimum cancer care required state‐of‐the‐art molecular diagnostics, a solid knowledge base to interpret and apply the results, and a nearly constant awareness of changes on the horizon, as the field is moving quickly. Comprehensive testing performed on patients at the beginning of 2019 is likely to be incomplete today. Drug approvals are no longer based solely on large phase 3 trials; these late‐stage trials are being replaced by "basket" and "umbrella" trials. This approach allows for faster allocation of the right drug to the right patient. Subsequent new regulatory and payer approvals seem to come daily.

Precision medicine is now part of standard practice, which brings many new challenges. How do we deal with tumor heterogeneity, and will liquid biopsies satisfactorily replace tissue‐based testing? Are we justified in, and can we afford, testing a large sample of patients, knowing that we will only rarely find the sought-after "needle in the haystack"? How do we manage our patients' expectations when there is so much press and hype surrounding our new discoveries? Can we afford to develop and ultimately pay for increasingly expensive therapies targeting increasingly smaller proportions of patients?

There is, of course, no turning back, but there is much work ahead.

### Toward the early detection of cancer by decoding the epigenetic and environmental fingerprints of cell-free DNA [^114FeiZC]. Cancer Cell (2019). Low credibility.

The widespread adaptation of liquid biopsy for the early detection of cancer has yet to reach clinical utility. Circulating tumor DNA is commonly detected through the presence of genetic alterations, but only a minor fraction of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments exhibit mutations. The cellular processes occurring in cancer development mark the chromatin. These epigenetic marks are reflected by modifications in the cfDNA methylation, fragment size, and structure.

In this review, we describe how going beyond DNA sequence information alone, by analyzing cfDNA epigenetic and immune signatures, boosts the potential of liquid biopsy for the early detection of cancer.

### Circulating tumor DNA in advanced solid tumors: Clinical relevance and future directions [^116k5ppH]. CA (2021). Low credibility.

The application of genomic profiling assays using plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly evolving in the management of patients with advanced solid tumors. Diverse plasma ctDNA technologies in both commercial and academic laboratories are in routine or emerging use. The increasing integration of such testing to inform treatment decision-making by oncology clinicians has complexities and challenges but holds significant potential to substantially improve patient outcomes. In this review, the authors discuss the role of plasma ctDNA assays in oncology care and provide an overview of ongoing research that may inform real-world clinical applications in the near future.

### Traditional diagnostics versus disruptive technology: The role of the pathologist in the era of liquid biopsy [^114HeN2Q]. Cancer Research (2020). Low credibility.

Precision medicine in cancer care is predicated on access to several fundamental pieces of data: (i) a precise tumor diagnosis, (ii) accurate stage classification, and (iii) protein or molecular biomarkers that predict the efficacy of targeted therapies. For all patients with cancer, these data points are generated by obtaining a tumor sample and subjecting it to analysis by a pathologist and, when appropriate, a molecular pathologist.

While tumor diagnosis and pathologic staging (gross and microscopic examination of the primary tumor and draining lymph nodes) require the infrastructure and expertise of an anatomic pathology program, the advent of "liquid biopsy" has driven a shift in molecular biomarker testing away from local pathology laboratories and into high-throughput, centralized (and often for-profit) laboratories.

What does this mean for patient care? How is the role of the pathologist affected? What are the implications for integration of diagnostic information and ultimately for appropriate therapy selection? This article will consider the testing landscape, address challenges in the use of liquid biopsy in clinical practice, and consider ways the pathologist should be involved in interpreting liquid biopsy data in the context of the patient's cancer diagnosis and stage.

### Circulating tumor cells: Blood-based detection, molecular biology, and clinical applications [^114vXRPz]. Cancer Cell (2025). Low credibility.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells shed from primary tumors or metastases into the bloodstream. As the first non-invasive "liquid biopsy" for cancer monitoring, CTCs have been largely surpassed by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for clinical applications, given the ease of DNA sequencing without specialized cell isolation methods. However, emerging rare cell capture technologies that can process larger blood volumes and enable advanced single-cell analyses may enhance the range and potential of CTC-based biomarkers.

CTCs are increasingly valuable for assessing tumor heterogeneity, guiding protein biomarker-driven cancer immune therapies, and assessing heterogeneous drug resistance, as well as for detecting minimal disease. CTCs, thus, remain central to understanding cancer dissemination and are poised to offer complementary diagnostic roles in the application of minimally invasive liquid biopsies for cancer. Here, we review recent advances in the study of these rare circulating cancer cells and discuss limitations and future directions.

### Utility of circulating tumor DNA in cancer diagnostics with emphasis on early detection [^111tEPj4]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Various recent studies have focused on analyzing tumor genetic material released into the bloodstream, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Herein, we describe research on the application of ctDNA to cancer management, including prognosis determination, monitoring for treatment efficacy and relapse, treatment selection, and quantification of tumor size and disease burden.

Specifically, we examine the utility of ctDNA for early cancer diagnostics, focusing on the development of a blood test to detect cancer in asymptomatic individuals by sequencing and analyzing mutations in ctDNA. Next, we discuss the prospect of using ctDNA to test for cancer and present our calculations based on previously published empirical findings in cancer and prenatal diagnostics.

We show that very early-stage (asymptomatic) tumors are not likely to release enough ctDNA to be detectable in a typical blood draw of 10 mL. Data are also presented showing that mutations in circulating free DNA can be found in healthy individuals and will likely be very difficult to distinguish from those associated with cancer. We conclude that the ctDNA test, in addition to its high cost and complexity, will likely suffer from the same issues of low sensitivity and specificity as traditional biomarkers when applied to population screening and early (asymptomatic) cancer diagnosis.

### Assessing the clinical utility of liquid biopsies across 5 potential indications from therapy selection to population screening: A review [^1142MvQN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

There has been great enthusiasm for the emerging technology of molecular-based tests to detect and quantify tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, colloquially known as a liquid biopsy. However, less attention has been given to how their clinical utility depends on the indication for testing, which includes a range of clinical situations, each presenting unique challenges.

- **Observations**: Five indications for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) blood testing were considered. (1) For therapy selection, ctDNA tests can identify genetic alterations in patients with cancer amenable to targeted therapy, but most patients do not have a targetable alteration. (2) For response to therapy, the absence of residual tumor DNA following cancer surgery could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but it is unclear that this will happen in practice. (3) For disease surveillance following cancer treatment, ctDNA tests may well detect cancer recurrence before symptoms appear, yet earlier intervention may have no effect on mortality. (4) For diagnosis of suspected cancer, ctDNA tests are able to identify some symptomatic cancers, but how they add to the conventional diagnostic evaluation is unknown. (5) For screening for cancer, multicancer tests can detect many types of cancer, but their low sensitivity for early-stage tumors raises questions as to whether screening can help patients live longer or live better.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Circulating tumor DNA tests are being promoted for multiple indications. Numerous studies are ongoing, but randomized clinical trials of their effectiveness and impact are still needed to address these questions adequately.

### Do circulating tumor cells, exosomes, and circulating tumor nucleic acids have clinical utility? A report of the association for molecular pathology [^117AQNRA]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and screening for tumors through noninvasive means represent an important paradigm shift in precision medicine. In contrast to tissue biopsy, detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor nucleic acids provides a minimally invasive method for predictive and prognostic marker detection. This approach allows early and serial assessment of metastatic disease, including follow-up during remission, characterization of treatment effects, and clonal evolution. Isolation and characterization of CTCs and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are likely to improve cancer diagnosis, treatment, and minimal residual disease monitoring. However, more trials are required to validate the clinical utility of precise molecular markers for a variety of tumor types. This review focuses on the clinical utility of CTCs and ctDNA testing in patients with solid tumors, including somatic and epigenetic alterations that can be detected. A comparison of methods used to isolate and detect CTCs and some of the intricacies of the characterization of the ctDNA are also provided.

### Liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease - latest advances and implications for cure [^116LRKCf]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsy has been introduced as a new diagnostic concept predicated on the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor-derived factors, in particular, cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). Highly sensitive liquid biopsy assays have been developed that can now be applied to detect and characterize minimal residual disease (MRD), which reflects the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. This application is the new frontier of liquid biopsy analyses, which are challenged by the very low concentrations of CTCs and ctDNA in blood samples.

In this review, we discuss the key technologies that can be used to detect and characterize CTCs in surveillance of MRD and provide a brief overview of similar roles of ctDNA analyses. We then focus on the clinical data on the use of CTCs and ctDNA in the detection and monitoring of MRD and in obtaining information on therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms relevant to the management of individual patients with cancer.

### Towards preanalytical best practices for liquid biopsy studies: A BLOODPAC landscape analysis [^112w2tng]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsy refers to a broad group of minimally invasive tests performed on blood or other body fluids that provide molecular or cellular information. Diverse potential clinical applications of liquid biopsy assays can inform medical decisions and improve the care of patients with cancer; however, further studies are required to evaluate the analytical and clinical validity and utility of many of these applications.

BLOODPAC is a public‐private consortium of industry, academic, non‐profit, and federal agency stakeholders with a common goal to accelerate regulatory approval and clinical implementation of novel blood‐based tests for cancer within the framework of precision medicine. Central to this effort has been the development of coordinated approaches and common infrastructure for pre‐competitive and post‐publication data sharing. Over 60 BLOODPAC collaborators contribute to mutually agreed‐upon definitions, common approaches at the time of writing a submission, collaborative efforts to fill knowledge and data gaps, and deposition of data into the BLOODPAC Data Commons. The BLOODPAC Data Commons is a cloud‐based data platform with rules‐based access that makes data findable, attributable, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

The BLOODPAC Preanalytical Working Group coordinated the development of 11 minimum technical (preanalytical) data elements (MTDEs) for any data submitted to the Data Commons. This development process was guided by initial analysis of data submitted to the BLOODPAC Data Commons and leveraged input from the diverse BLOODPAC membership in collaboration.

### Circulating tumor DNA for personalized lung cancer monitoring [^1159A8sb]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

NSCLC testing using ctDNA is a promising step for precision medicine and the liquid biopsy towards a new era where continuous genetic profiling of tumors enables the most effective treatment. The approach discussed in the paper could also be further applied to other cancers, such as breast and colorectal, where ctDNA testing has already been studied. Careful consideration and comparison of this new method with traditional biomarkers and tests is needed to ensure ctDNA testing benefits patients and makes a smooth transition from the lab to the clinic.

### Reviews on current liquid biopsy for detection and management of pancreatic cancers [^111HpWvF]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It presents dismal clinical outcomes in patients, and the incidence of pancreatic cancer has continuously increased, likely becoming the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths by as early as 2030. One of the main reasons for the high mortality rate is the lack of tools for early-stage detection. Detection and monitoring of therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer rely on imaging analysis and invasive endoscopic examination.

Liquid biopsy-based analysis of genetic alterations in biofluids has become a fundamental component in the diagnosis and management of cancers. There is an urgent need for scientific and technological advancements to detect pancreatic cancer early and to develop effective therapies. The development of a highly sensitive and specific liquid biopsy tool will require extensive understanding of the characteristics of circulating tumor DNA in biofluids.

Here, we have reviewed the status of liquid biopsy in detecting and monitoring pancreatic cancers and our understanding of circulating tumor DNA that should be considered for the development of a liquid biopsy tool, which will greatly aid in the diagnosis and healthcare of people at risk.

### Liquid biopsies, what we do not know (yet) [^113JsCnW]. Cancer Cell (2017). Low credibility.

The inherent molecular heterogeneity of metastatic tumors and the ability of cancer genomes to dynamically evolve are not properly captured by tissue specimens. Analysis of cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cells has the potential to change clinical practice by exploiting blood rather than tissue as a source of information. Liquid biopsies are already used to monitor disease response and track the emergence of drug resistance. The suitability of blood-based molecular profiles for early detection and monitoring minimal residual disease is being evaluated. In this review, we address open questions in this fast-evolving field of research.

### Can a liquid biopsy detect circulating tumor DNA with low-passage whole-genome sequencing in patients with a sarcoma? A pilot evaluation [^116eao6K]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). High credibility.

A liquid biopsy is a test that evaluates the status of a disease by analyzing a sample of bodily fluid, most commonly blood. In recent years, there has been progress in the development and clinical application of liquid biopsy methods to identify blood-based, tumor-specific biomarkers for many cancer types. However, the implementation of these technologies to aid in the treatment of patients who have a sarcoma remains behind other fields of cancer medicine.

For this study, we chose to evaluate a sarcoma liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). All human beings have normal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood. In contrast with cfDNA, ctDNA is genetic material present in the bloodstream that is derived from a tumor. ctDNA carries the unique genomic fingerprint of the tumor with changes that are not present in normal circulating cfDNA. A successful ctDNA liquid biopsy must be able to target these tumor-specific genetic alterations.

For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in lung cancers, and ctDNA liquid biopsies are currently in clinical use to evaluate the status of disease in patients who have lung cancer by detecting EGFR mutations in the blood. As opposed to many carcinomas, sarcomas do not have common mutations that could serve as the foundation for a ctDNA liquid biopsy. However, many sarcomas have structural changes to their chromosomes, including gains and losses of portions or entire chromosomes, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), that could serve as a target for a ctDNA liquid bi.

### Circulating tumour DNA - looking beyond the blood [^116TFb4P]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, various liquid biopsy techniques have emerged as viable alternatives to the analysis of traditional tissue biopsy samples. Such surrogate 'biopsies' offer numerous advantages, including the relative ease of obtaining serial samples and overcoming the issues of interpreting one or more small tissue samples that might not reflect the entire tumour burden. At the time of writing, the majority of research in the area of liquid biopsies has focused on blood-based biomarkers, predominantly using plasma-derived circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). However, ctDNA can also be obtained from various non-blood sources, and these might offer unique advantages over plasma ctDNA.

In this review, we discuss advances in the analysis of ctDNA from non-blood sources. We focus on urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and pleural or peritoneal fluid, but also consider other sources of ctDNA. We discuss how these alternative sources can have a distinct yet complementary role to that of blood ctDNA analysis and consider various technical aspects of non-blood ctDNA assay development. We also reflect on the settings in which non-blood ctDNA can offer distinct advantages over plasma ctDNA and explore some of the challenges associated with translating these alternative assays from academia into clinical use.

### Emerging concepts in liquid biopsies [^114K4cF1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Characterizing and monitoring tumor genomes with blood samples could achieve significant improvements in precision medicine. As tumors shed parts of themselves into the circulation, analyses of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and tumor-derived exosomes, often referred to as "liquid biopsies", may enable tumor genome characterization by minimally invasive means. Indeed, multiple studies have described how molecular information about parent tumors can be extracted from these components.

- **Technologies**: Here, we briefly summarize technologies and then elaborate on emerging novel concepts that may further propel the field.

We address normal and detectable mutation levels in the context of our knowledge regarding the gradual accumulation of mutations during aging and in light of technological limitations. Finally, we discuss whether liquid biopsies are ready to be used in routine clinical practice.

### Promises and pitfalls of multi-cancer early detection using liquid biopsy tests [^113KcbyR]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Cancer screening is an essential public health intervention for diagnosing cancers at an early stage, enabling earlier treatment — ideally with curative intent — and leading to improved outcomes. Over the past decade, liquid biopsy-based tests have emerged as a promising, minimally invasive, and broadly applicable screening approach by combining multi-cancer early detection (MCED) with tumor tissue-of-origin identification. Large-scale randomized clinical trials evaluating liquid biopsy-based MCED approaches are now under way, although whether the diagnostic performance of this first generation of MCED tests is sufficient to translate into clinical benefits remains to be determined. In this review, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of MCED tests and highlight possible trajectories for the field of early cancer detection.

### Nci workshop on ctDNA in cancer treatment and clinical care [^116qXquJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). High credibility.

Detection of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from solid tumors is a fast-evolving field with significant potential for improving patient treatment outcomes. The spectrum of applications for ctDNA assays is broad and includes very diverse intended uses that will require different strategies to demonstrate utility.

On September 14–15, 2023, the National Cancer Institute held an in-person workshop in Rockville, MD, titled "ctDNA in Cancer Treatment and Clinical Care". The goal of the workshop was to examine what is currently known and what needs to be determined for various ctDNA liquid biopsy use cases related to the treatment and management of patients with solid tumors, and to explore how the community can best assess the value of ctDNA assays and technology. Additionally, new approaches were presented that may show promise in the future.

The information exchanged in this workshop will provide the community with a better understanding of this field and its potential to affect and benefit decision-making in the treatment of patients with solid tumors.

### Clinical applications of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA as liquid biopsy [^113it6ds]. Cancer Discovery (2016). Low credibility.

The term "liquid biopsy" refers to the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of cancer patients. This approach has garnered significant attention due to its potential implications for personalized medicine. Analyses of CTCs and ctDNA have opened new diagnostic possibilities and are currently the foundation of liquid biopsy diagnostics. This review focuses on key areas of clinical applications for CTCs and ctDNA, including cancer detection, prognosis prediction in patients with curable diseases, monitoring systemic therapies, and patient stratification based on therapeutic targets or resistance mechanisms.

- **Significance**: The application of CTCs and ctDNA for early cancer detection is of great public interest. However, it faces challenges related to assay specificity and sensitivity. Prognosis prediction for patients with curable diseases is achievable in several tumor types, particularly breast cancer. Monitoring systemic therapies' success or failure through sequential CTC and ctDNA measurements is also feasible. Interventional studies focusing on treatment stratification through CTC and ctDNA analysis are required to further integrate liquid biopsy into personalized medicine.

### Liquid biopsy at home: Delivering precision medicine for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1159Hygd]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on the oncological healthcare system in different fields, affecting everything from cancer patient care to hospital organization. Numerous studies have investigated both the effects of the pandemic and the high degree of flexibility required for oncologic teams to reorganize their daily routines. In this context, the FMI-Liquid@Home has emerged as a key strategy to address the new pandemic situation in Italy.

Of the 218 liquid biopsies conducted with FMI-Liquid@Home, 153 were performed in our department. These patients were assessed for molecular alterations at diagnosis, in accordance with the cancer subtype and tissue availability, through NGS on tissue. The Tumor Molecular Board selected patients who underwent liquid biopsy analysis.

The liquid biopsy was performed at various times based on patients' needs: when there was inadequate tumor biopsy tissue at diagnosis or the biopsies could not be repeated; throughout the cancer history to detect druggable or resistant alterations; after surgery or adjuvant therapy to identify minimal residual disease; and to monitor therapeutic response.

- **Tumor subtypes distribution**: The distribution of tumor subtypes may not represent the general population. However, it aligned with the median age and gender distribution. CRC and NSCLC emerged as the most frequent cancer subtypes among FMI-Liquid@Home, as well as in hospital settings, due to the significant benefits liquid biopsy could provide in terms of identifiable druggable mutations and available targeted therapies.

### Circulating tumor DNA enables sensitive detection of actionable gene fusions and rearrangements across cancer types [^114VyyHi]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of liquid biopsies for fusion detection hinges on factors like ctDNA shedding, which is associated with tumor type and disease burden, as well as the testing platform employed. There is a widespread notion that ctDNA testing is suboptimal for detecting genetic fusions compared with tissue testing; however, it is noteworthy that testing platforms have evolved over time, enhancing their performance. Our study highlights that when shedding reaches a specific threshold (a tumor fraction of ≥ 1%), liquid biopsies emerge as a viable alternative to tissue testing. Among the 53,842 examined liquid biopsies, 14% (7,377) contained at least one pathogenic rearrangement, a clinically significant discovery. These data suggest that liquid biopsies have the potential to bridge a crucial gap, expanding precision medicine opportunities, especially when acquiring tissue-based next-generation sequencing is impractical or delayed.

### Liquid biopsy at home: Delivering precision medicine for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112DQApQ]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease-2019 has changed the delivery of health care worldwide, and the pandemic has challenged oncologists to reorganize cancer care. Recently, progress has been made in the field of precision medicine to provide patients with cancer their best therapeutic choice for individual needs. In this context, the Foundation Medicine (FMI)-Liquid@Home project has emerged as a key weapon to deal with the new pandemic situation.

FoundationOne Liquid Assay (F1L) is a next-generation sequencing-based liquid biopsy service that can detect 324 molecular alterations and genomic signatures, available since May 2020 at patients' homes (FMI-Liquid@Home). We analyzed time and cost savings for patients with cancer, their caregivers, and the National Healthcare System (NHS) using FMI-Liquid@Home versus F1L performed at our Department. Different variables have been evaluated. Between May 2020 and August 2021, 218 FMI-Liquid@Home procedures were performed for patients with cancer in Italy. Among these, our Department performed 153 FMI-Liquid@Home procedures with a success rate of 98% (compared to 95% for F1L in the hospital).

Time savings for patients and their caregivers were 494.86 and 427.36 hours, respectively, and cost savings amounted to €13,548.70. Moreover, for working people, these savings were 1,084.71 hours and €31,239.65, respectively. In addition, the total gain for the hospital was 163.5 hours and €6,785, whereas for the NHS, it was 1,084.71 hours and €51,573.60, respectively. The FMI-Liquid@Home service appears to be useful and convenient, allowing time and cost savings for patients, caregivers, and the NHS.

### Pushing the boundaries of liquid biopsies for early precision intervention [^113fzN7j]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsies are emerging as powerful, minimally invasive approaches that have the potential to solve several long-standing problems spanning the continuum of cancer care: early detection of cancer, minimal residual disease tracking, refinement of the heterogeneity of clinical responses, and therapeutic response monitoring in the metastatic setting. Existing challenges driven by technical limitations and the establishment of the clinical value of liquid biopsies represent fields of active research that call for convergence science approaches to bridge scientific discovery with clinical care.

### Liquid biopsy holds its own in tumor profiling [^112sd75o]. Cancer Discovery (2016). Low credibility.

Results from the largest liquid biopsy study at the time of writing indicate that the genetic changes detected by analyzing circulating tumor DNA in blood samples largely recapitulate those identified through conventional tissue biopsy. Sequencing circulating tumor DNA in plasma could be a useful option for monitoring the development of resistance to targeted therapy.

### Emerging concepts in liquid biopsies [^114oP1HP]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A key challenge for liquid biopsy applications is determining how close we are to clinical implementation. A more mature understanding of the biology behind circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and exosomes is critical. This understanding will help assess whether the molecular profiles generated from these sources accurately reflect the physiological disease state of the patient and aid physicians in reliably detecting and monitoring disease. To achieve this, we must investigate the origin and dynamics of these tumor components in circulation and ascertain their biological significance and clinical relevance.

Although the exact mechanisms behind the release and dynamics of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) remain unknown, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the presence of tumor DNA in the bloodstream. The most widely accepted theory suggests that tumor cells release DNA through apoptosis, necrosis, or cell secretion in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, some cancer cases have shown detectable ctDNA levels despite the absence of detectable CTCs. Conversely, a patient with over 100,000 CTCs demonstrated only a low ctDNA allelic frequency, despite progressive disease, ranging merely from 2% to 3%. While in most patients, CTC numbers and ctDNA levels are correlated, such exceptions highlight the complexity and incomplete understanding of the biology underlying CTC and ctDNA release.

Additional uncertainties concerning the clinical implementation of liquid biopsies include whether ctDNA provides a comprehensive representation of a patient's cancer and if it reflects all existing metastases.

### Liquid biopsy: Is there an advantage to analyzing circulating exosomal DNA compared to cfDNA or are they the same [^114EpZBV]. Cancer Research (2019). Low credibility.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This life-threatening disease necessitates novel strategies for early detection and therapy response prediction. Circulating DNA was first described 70 years ago; however, only the recent evolution in PCR-based sequencing techniques allows the minimally invasive molecular profiling of circulating mutant DNA from small-volume "liquid biopsies" such as blood, urine, or saliva. This article aims to summarize the fast-growing evidence for cfDNA and exosomal DNA as minimally invasive diagnostic markers in solid tumors and to highlight their opposing diagnostic advantages and disadvantages.

### Liquid biopsy, diagnostic imaging, and future synergies [^112Q6m8u]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Imaging plays an integral role in the initial diagnosis and longitudinal care of patients with cancer. Liquid biopsies, which most commonly involve the genetic analysis of circulating free DNA, have emerged as important complementary tools in cancer care with the potential to interface with imaging at each step of the cancer care continuum. Here, the authors use non-small-cell lung cancer as a paradigm to elucidate factors driving the need for liquid biopsy in the spectrum of lung cancer care, demonstrate ways in which liquid biopsy has already changed standard clinical practice, and discuss anticipated synergies of liquid biopsy and imaging in screening and early detection and in monitoring of disease.

### Cell-free tumour DNA testing for early detection of cancer - a potential future tool [^1169SdM4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In recent years, the detection of cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA), or liquid biopsy, has emerged as an attractive noninvasive methodology to detect cancer-specific genetic aberrations in plasma, and numerous studies have reported on the feasibility of ctDNA in advanced cancer. In particular, ctDNA assays can capture a more 'global' portrait of tumour heterogeneity, monitor therapy response, and lead to early detection of resistance mutations. More recently, ctDNA analysis has also been proposed as a promising future tool for the detection of early cancer and/or cancer screening.

As the average proportion of mutated DNA in plasma is very low (0.4% even in advanced cancer), exceedingly sensitive techniques need to be developed. In addition, since tumours are genetically heterogeneous, any screening test needs to assay multiple genetic targets in order to increase the chances of detection. Further research on the genetic progression from normal to cancer cells and their release of ctDNA is imperative in order to avoid overtreating benign/indolent lesions, causing more harm than good by early diagnosis. More knowledge on the sources and elimination of cell-free DNA will enable better interpretation in older individuals and those with comorbidities.

Furthermore, as white blood cells are the major source of cell-free DNA in plasma, it is important to distinguish acquired mutations in leukocytes (benign clonal haematopoiesis) from an upcoming hematological malignancy or other cancer. In conclusion, although many studies report encouraging results, further technical development and larger studies are necessary.

### Circulating tumour cells and DNA as liquid biopsies in gastrointestinal cancer [^114PyZRD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Blood is the most extensively studied body fluid and, because it contains circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and circulating tumour-derived cell-free DNA (ctDNA), it may represent a liquid biopsy for cancer. Methods for enrichment and detection of CTCs and ctDNA, their clinical applications, and future opportunities in gastrointestinal cancers were the focus of this review.

- **Methods**: The PubMed database was searched for literature up to 24 June 2017, with a focus on the past 10 years. Identified articles were further scrutinized for relevant references. Articles were those in English relating to colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer.

- **Results**: Both CTCs and ctDNA are in low abundance compared with other cellular components of blood, but effective enrichment and highly sensitive techniques are available for their detection. Potential clinical applications of these liquid biopsies include screening, prognostic stratification, therapy administration, monitoring of treatment effect or resistance, and surveillance. Liquid biopsies provide opportunities to reduce the need for invasive tissue sampling, especially in the context of intratumoral heterogeneity and the need for tumour genotyping.

- **Conclusion**: Liquid biopsies have applications in gastrointestinal cancers to improve clinical decision-making.

### Use of circulating tumor DNA for cancer immunotherapy [^114iq4Fc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2019). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsy offers a versatile, noninvasive opportunity to diagnose, characterize, and monitor disease in patients with cancer. There are particularly promising applications with which to use liquid biopsies to predict and evaluate response to immunotherapy. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can reflect the genomic state of a patient's overall disease and, thus, might identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. ctDNA might also be a proxy for a patient's overall disease burden, which could be used for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment response.

These applications can enable novel trial designs, such as the enrollment of early-stage patients with a high risk for relapse and the evaluation of response patterns unique to immunotherapies. However, barriers to the widespread adoption of ctDNA assessment remain, including the absence of standardized procedures for collecting and processing ctDNA samples and relatively limited data on clinical utility. Identifying and solving these challenges could allow ctDNA to become a powerful clinical and research tool in the era of personalized immunotherapy.
