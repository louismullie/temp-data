## Question

Pediatric antibiotic for uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric antibiotic selection, duration, and stewardship for urinary tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the UTI phenotype and severity. Then, I should verify empiric antibiotic choices by age, route, and local resistance patterns. Next, I will review duration evidence for cystitis, febrile UTI, and pyelonephritis, including newer trials. After that, I need to check special populations and complicated UTI management. Finally, I will integrate stewardship, follow-up, and a practical decision algorithm, making sure each assertion is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because everything downstream depends on it. Pediatric UTIs are typically categorized as lower tract cystitis versus upper tract pyelonephritis, and as uncomplicated versus complicated based on host factors, severity, and anatomy; this framing guides route, spectrum, and duration of therapy, so I need to ensure I anchor decisions to these buckets before choosing antibiotics.

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic selection for uncomplicated cystitis in children older than 3 months. Narrow-spectrum oral agents such as cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are appropriate when local susceptibility supports them, with cephalexin often favored due to rising resistance in E. coli to TMP-SMX and amoxicillin; I should double-check local antibiograms before committing to TMP-SMX or amoxicillin monotherapy [^c935e053] [^f970fe5c]. Wait, let me verify the resistance context: contemporary data show high rates of TMP-SMX and amoxicillin resistance in pediatric E. coli, reinforcing the preference for first-generation cephalosporins or amoxicillin-clavulanate when appropriate, and stewardship frameworks emphasize starting narrow and de-escalating with culture results [^723dca33] [^8b7f31a1].

> For febrile UTI or suspected pyelonephritis in children 2 to 24 months, I should confirm that oral and parenteral therapy are equally efficacious when the child is clinically stable. The AAP supports either route, with oral options including amoxicillin-clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefixime, and parenteral options including ceftriaxone or cefotaxime; I need to ensure I tailor to local resistance and severity, and switch to oral therapy once improving [^996fc75a] [^8b7f31a1]. Hold on, I should verify dosing anchors: ceftriaxone 50–75 mg/kg once daily is standard in pediatric UTI pathways, and this aligns with AAP tables and contemporary pediatric stewardship guidance [^1cf32f4d] [^f021b1d9].

> For infants under 3 months, I need to ensure I do not under-treat. Young infants generally require hospitalization, parenteral therapy, and a full sepsis evaluation given the risk of bacteremia and missed invasive infection; empiric coverage should be broad-spectrum, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin or a third-generation cephalosporin like cefotaxime, with adjustments once cultures return and clinical stability allows step-down to oral therapy [^723dca33] [^8b7f31a1]. Let me reconsider the transition: once afebrile for 24–48 hours and able to tolerate feeds, switching to an appropriate oral agent to complete the course is reasonable, but I should confirm total duration based on syndrome and response [^723dca33].

> Next, I should review duration for uncomplicated cystitis. Historically, 7–14 days was standard, but wait, let me verify newer evidence: meta-analyses and RCTs suggest that 2–4 days can be as effective as 7–14 days for lower UTI, and observational pediatric data show no increase in recurrence with 3–5 days versus longer courses; thus, a 3–5 day course is reasonable for stable, responding children with cystitis, provided close follow-up is feasible [^647e4593] [^647e4593]. I should confirm that this aligns with stewardship principles: yes, shorter effective courses reduce adverse events and resistance pressure without compromising outcomes when carefully selected [^f021b1d9].

> For febrile UTI or pyelonephritis, I initially thought 7–14 days remained the universal standard, but hold on, I should verify evolving data. The AAP guideline supports 7–14 days, yet comparative effectiveness studies and RCTs suggest that shorter courses may be noninferior in selected children; for example, a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate regimen was noninferior to 10 days for noncomplicated febrile UTI, and observational data in pyelonephritis show similar failure rates with 6–9 versus 10–14 days, with a signal toward less resistance with shorter courses [^3389b020] [^7a4a0118] [^6031a15d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also note the SCOUT trial: extending therapy from 5 to 10 days after clinical improvement reduced failure, suggesting that stopping at 5 days may be too short in some contexts; thus, I should individualize duration to clinical response and severity, with 7–10 days remaining a conservative default for most pyelonephritis cases [^84cfd348] [^3389b020].

> I need to ensure I address complicated UTI, where definitions and management vary. ESPID categorizes cUTI by host factors, severity, and recurrence risk, and recommends broader initial therapy for sepsis, high-grade VUR, or immunocompromise, with total durations often 10–14 days but individualized; importantly, even in cUTI, emerging pediatric data suggest that shorter total courses may suffice once clinically improving, and IDSA adult guidance supports 7 days for many cUTI presentations, which can inform pediatric practice when extrapolated cautiously [^4d972e55] [^e8c912dd] [^fc1d9dae]. Let me double-check resistance risks: in children with recurrent UTI or prior ESBL exposure, oral options like nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX may be preferred empirically if susceptible, while parenteral aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones are reserved for severe or resistant cases with specialist input [^75ae50f2].

> For neonates and young infants, I should confirm that most require parenteral therapy and hospitalization. Short-course IV strategies are being studied, but current pediatric data are insufficient to change practice; thus, I should continue with 7–14 total days, typically 2–4 days IV followed by oral step-down once stable, with close monitoring for clinical response and complications [^723dca33] [^3acd3848]. Hold on, I should verify that oral step-down is acceptable after initial IV stabilization; yes, multiple pediatric studies and reviews support oral completion once the child is afebrile and clinically improving [^3acd3848].

> I will now examine antimicrobial stewardship principles that must be embedded at each step. Start narrow and escalate only if there is treatment failure or high-risk features, obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and de-escalate promptly with susceptibilities; avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents such as fluoroquinolones or carbapenems unless clearly indicated, and prefer agents with low resistance potential when equivalent options exist [^f021b1d9] [^c935e053]. Let me verify that local pathways improve outcomes: yes, implementing cephalexin-first pathways for uncomplicated UTI increased narrow-spectrum use without increasing failures or resistance, supporting stewardship-aligned empiric choices [^c3eb9e9e].

> Next, I should review follow-up and imaging considerations, since they influence antibiotic decisions and recurrence risk. Routine VCUG after a first febrile UTI is no longer recommended; renal and bladder ultrasound is advised to detect anomalies, with further imaging reserved for recurrence, atypical courses, or abnormal findings, and families should be counseled to seek prompt evaluation for recurrent fevers to catch relapses early [^7344a090] [^f3c48e4c]. I need to ensure I also address prophylaxis: long-term antibiotics have a modest effect on recurrence at best and increase resistance, so if considered for high-risk children with VUR or frequent recurrences, use the lowest effective dose, reassess frequently, and consider nonantibiotic strategies such as bowel and bladder optimization or cranberry products where appropriate [^81acdbfa] [^e1623c22].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with the evidence. For a stable child older than 3 months with uncomplicated cystitis, use a 3–5 day oral narrow-spectrum regimen such as cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, guided by local susceptibility, with 7 days reasonable if response is slow or follow-up is uncertain; for febrile UTI or pyelonephritis, use 7–10 days total, starting oral or IV based on severity and switching to oral when improving; for infants under 3 months, hospitalize, give parenteral therapy, and complete 7–14 days with step-down to oral when stable; for complicated UTI, extend to 10–14 days and tailor to clinical response and source control needs, involving specialists when indicated [^356073e6] [^3389b020] [^723dca33] [^4d972e55]. Hold on, I should verify that this matches both guideline ranges and contemporary trials; yes, it preserves conservative defaults while incorporating newer data supporting shorter effective durations in selected children [^3389b020] [^6031a15d] [^7a4a0118].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and highlight uncertainties. Evidence quality for pediatric UTI duration is improving but remains heterogeneous; while 7–14 days remains acceptable for febrile UTI, 5–7 days may suffice in many children, and 3–5 days is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis, provided careful selection and follow-up; resistance patterns mandate narrow-spectrum empiric choices and culture-directed de-escalation, and shared decision-making with families is essential to balance efficacy, safety, and stewardship goals [^3389b020] [^356073e6] [^6031a15d] [^f021b1d9]. But wait, what if the child has recurrent UTIs or complex anatomy? In those cases, I should individualize duration, consider prophylaxis only when benefits outweigh harms, and coordinate with pediatric urology and infectious diseases to optimize long-term outcomes [^4d972e55] [^e8c912dd].

For pediatric UTIs, **first-line oral antibiotics** include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if local resistance is ≤ 20%) [^c935e053] [^723dca33]. For **febrile UTIs or pyelonephritis**, use a 7–10 day course; for **uncomplicated cystitis**, 5–7 days is sufficient [^3389b020] [^356073e6]. Intravenous ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is indicated for severe illness, vomiting, or inability to tolerate oral therapy [^8b7f31a1]. Adjust therapy to culture results, monitor for clinical response within 48–72 hours, and avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist due to safety concerns [^f970fe5c].

---

## Common pathogens

Escherichia coli accounts for **80–90%** of pediatric UTIs, with other Enterobacterales (Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter) and Enterococcus spp. also implicated [^723dca33]. Resistance patterns vary by region, with notable resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in some areas [^723dca33].

## First-line antibiotic choices

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line antibiotics** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Cephalexin <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if resistance ≤ 20%) | - 5–7 day course [^notfound] <br/> - Avoid nitrofurantoin in febrile infants due to poor tissue penetration [^notfound] |
| Febrile UTI/pyelonephritis | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Cephalexin <br/> - Cefixime | - 7–10 day course [^3389b020] <br/> - Oral therapy is effective if the child can tolerate it [^996fc75a] |
| Severe illness, vomiting, or unable to tolerate oral therapy | - Ceftriaxone <br/> - Cefotaxime | Intravenous therapy until clinically stable, then switch to oral therapy to complete the course [^3acd3848] |

## Alternative antibiotics

Alternative options include **nitrofurantoin** for uncomplicated cystitis in children older than 3 months (not for febrile infants) and **fluoroquinolones** (e.g. ciprofloxacin) reserved for multidrug-resistant organisms or severe infections when no alternatives exist due to potential musculoskeletal adverse effects [^f970fe5c].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: 5–7 days [^notfound].
- **Febrile UTI/pyelonephritis**: 7–10 days [^3389b020].
- **Severe illness or complicated UTI**: 10–14 days, individualized based on clinical response [^fc1d9dae].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Age**: Neonates and infants < 3 months require parenteral therapy and careful monitoring [^723dca33].
- **Illness severity**: Severe illness or sepsis warrants intravenous broad-spectrum therapy [^2ee308e5].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Guide empiric therapy selection and adjustments [^996fc75a].
- **Allergies**: Avoid beta-lactams in severe hypersensitivity; consider alternatives accordingly [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical response**: Reassess within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, repeat urinalysis and culture, and adjust therapy [^d49b6f40].
- **Imaging**: Renal and bladder ultrasound is recommended after the first febrile UTI to detect structural abnormalities [^7344a090].
- **Prophylaxis**: Not routinely recommended; consider only in select high-risk cases (e.g. high-grade VUR) with careful monitoring for resistance and adverse effects [^81acdbfa].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

Shorter-course therapy (**5–7 days**) is supported by emerging evidence for febrile UTIs, but further research is needed before widespread adoption [^6031a15d] [^7a4a0118]. Antibiotic stewardship emphasizes **narrow-spectrum agents** and the shortest effective duration to limit resistance and adverse effects [^f021b1d9]. Nonantibiotic prophylaxis with **cranberry products** shows promise but requires more robust pediatric data [^c5efb76a].

---

Pediatric UTI management relies on **narrow-spectrum, culture-directed therapy** with duration tailored to severity and response, balancing efficacy with stewardship and safety.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^00006251]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^9509caf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^38413887]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^81efcc59]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^fce7a0e7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods:

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results:

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions:

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^cab34b09]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection in the pediatric population can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly and appropriately. All first infections may signify possible underlying anatomic or functional abnormality and require imaging of the lower and upper tracts. Accurate diagnosis of UTIs requires a properly collected quantitative urine culture. Treatment should be tailored to the pathogen as dictated by the urine culture sensitivities to minimize the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Prophylactic agents should differ from the antibiotic used in the acute setting and preferably concentrated in the urinary tract, with minimal effects on the normal fecal flora. In the long term, patients with documented evidence of renal scarring should be followed up for signs of renal deterioration and hypertension.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in pediatric patients undergoing urinary tract catheterization: a survey of members of the society for pediatric urology [^c38a5f97]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The relative lack of evidence guiding antibiotic use with catheterization in the pediatric population may explain the practice variation reported in our study. While there is some evidence that antibiotic use at the time of catheter removal can decrease symptomatic UTIs in adults, these results are not consistently reported and antibiotic use in this setting remains controversial. A recent Cochrane review of adult patients found limited evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of bacteriuria, with even less evidence that this reduces febrile morbidity in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. There is also limited evidence that antibiotics reduce bacteriuria for urodynamic studies in adults, but not enough evidence to suggest that antibiotics reduce symptomatic UTIs.

Variation in antibiotic use in our study may also be explained by a lack of specific management guidelines in this area. Organizational guidelines from the AUA, EAU, and others have limited applicability to the pediatric urology population, although they include the option to give antibiotics in complex scenarios. The AUA Best Practice Policy Statement on Urologic Surgery Antimicrobial Prophylaxis recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for removal of external urinary catheters and for urodynamics if risk factors such as urinary anatomic abnormalities, immunodeficiency, externalized catheters, colonized exogenous or endogenous material, and prolonged hospitalization are present. Many pediatric urology patients will have one or more of these risk factors, yet in our survey many prescribers do not routinely give antibiotics in scenarios that include these risk factors, such as an externalized catheter. The AUA statement suggests that, for patients with risk factors, antimicrobial use at the time of catheter removal may be therapeutic in the setting of prolonged catheterization following a procedure, but the statement does not make a recommendation whether empiric antibiotics or culture-directed therapy is preferable in this setting. Evidence for this is primarily based on adult and post-prostatectomy literature and again may have limited applicability to the pediatric urology population. The EAU guideline on urological infections similarly states that when continuous drainage is in place after surgery, prolonged perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended; however, asymptomatic bacteriuria may be treated after removal of the catheter. Finally, the United States Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also does not recommend routine antibiotics with short- and long-term catheterization, but does make a specific exception for patients with bacteriuria upon catheter removal following urologic surgery.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^34a473b4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infection antibiotic trial design: a systematic review [^1701f7c0]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent common bacterial infections in children. No guidance on the conduct of pediatric febrile UTI clinical trials (CTs) exist.

Objective

To assess the criteria used for patient selection and the efficacy end points in febrile pediatric UTI CTs.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016.

Study Selection

We combined Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text terms for "urinary tract infections" and "therapeutics" and "clinical trials" in children (0–18 years), identifying 3086 articles.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

We included 40 CTs in which a total of 4381 cases of pediatric UTIs were investigated. Positive urine culture results and fever were the most common inclusion criteria (93% and 78%, respectively). Urine sampling method, pyuria, and colony thresholds were highly variable. Clinical and microbiological end points were assessed in 88% and 93% of the studies, respectively. Timing for end point assessment was highly variable, and only 3 studies (17%) out of the 18 performed after the Food and Drug Administration 1998 guidance publication assessed primary and secondary end points consistently with this guidance.

Limitations

Our limitations included a mixed population of healthy children and children with an underlying condition. In 6 trials, researchers studied a subgroup of patients with afebrile UTI.

Conclusions

We observed a wide variability in the microbiological inclusion criteria and the timing for end point assessment. The available guidance for adults appear not to be used by pediatricians and do not seem applicable to the childhood UTI. A harmonized design for pediatric UTIs CT is necessary.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^6367ad96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^2269f9fc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^3acd3848]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Short-course therapy for urinary tract infections in children: the SCOUT randomized clinical trial [^84cfd348]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of pediatric-specific comparative data to guide duration of therapy recommendations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1bcc970e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

### Different imaging strategies in febrile urinary tract infection in childhood. what, when, why? [^cf994d21]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^9f7deb4f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^21a07948]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Design

This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis.

Participants

Five trials involving 463 children were performed.

Results

Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P < .01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).

Conclusions

Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.

The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in pediatric patients undergoing urinary tract catheterization: a survey of members of the society for pediatric urology [^31329126]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the most common nosocomial infection in the United States and lead to increased cost of care as well as patient length-of-stay, morbidity, and mortality. Recent national measures in the United States have sought to prevent and decrease the frequency of CAUTIs in the general population. Furthermore, there has been increasing pressure from payers, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to decrease infectious complications by imposing financial penalties on hospitals that perform poorly with regard to hospital-acquired conditions.

Alongside pressure to decrease infectious complications there has been an increasing focus on the problems caused by antibiotic resistance. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, each year over 2 million illnesses and over 20,000 deaths are directly attributable to antibiotic resistance. Problematic resistance patterns have forced urologists to use broader-spectrum antibiotics on a routine basis. Yet despite growing resistance patterns, antibiotic drug development has stymied and few new drugs are being developed. Antibiotic stewardship has been proposed as a solution to promote use of optimal antibiotic regimens; however, due to a lack of evidence in the pediatric urology population, further research is needed to define appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use. Current guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend antibiotic prophylaxis with urinary tract catheter removal if bacteriuria and other risk factors (such as older age, smoking status, deficient nutritional status, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, and prolonged hospitalization) are present; however, these are based on limited evidence and are not directly applicable to the pediatric urology population. Therefore, we sought to improve understanding of this unique population by first describing and measuring current practices. This study aimed to investigate current practice patterns and attitudes of pediatric urologists regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing urinary tract catheterization.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^bab0eecb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of a short-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis in children vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 791 children (aged 6 months to 18 years) with pyelonephritis, no difference was found in the odds of treatment failure for children prescribed a short-course of antibiotics (median 8 days) vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (median 11 days).

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that short-courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^f021b1d9]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Stewardship strategies in the inpatient setting — local guidelines — The development and dissemination of institutional guidelines for diagnosing and treating common infectious syndromes is a key function of stewardship programs, and guidelines provide evidence-based and standardized diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on local data and promote adherence to the use of formulary drugs. Antibiotic guidelines can be developed to target common indications for antibiotic use, such as community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, intraabdominal infections, and neonatal and pediatric sepsis, and these indications represent the majority of antibiotic use in most institutions. Inpatient guidelines can discuss appropriate clinical criteria suggestive of bacterial infections, diagnostic testing (including imaging studies when needed), specific empirical and targeted therapy (including dosing and options for severe drug allergies), and appropriate durations of therapy.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^2ee308e5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^6031a15d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for children with urinary tract infection in emergency and urgent care settings [^c3eb9e9e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Children with urinary tract infection (UTI) are often diagnosed in emergency and urgent care settings and increasingly are unnecessarily treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This study evaluated the effect of a quality improvement intervention on empiric antibiotic prescribing for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in children.

Methods

A local clinical pathway for uncomplicated UTI, introduced in June 2010, recommended empiric treatment with cephalexin, a narrow-spectrum (first-generation) cephalosporin antibiotic. A retrospective quasi-experimental study of pediatric patients older than 1 month presenting to emergency and urgent care settings from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, with uncomplicated UTI was conducted. Hospitalized patients and those with chronic conditions or urogenital abnormalities were excluded. Control charts and interrupted time-series analysis were used to analyze the primary outcome of narrow-spectrum antibiotic prescribing rates and the balancing measures of 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, and subsequent inpatient admissions for UTI.

Results

A total of 2134 patients were included. There was an immediate and sustained significant increase in cephalexin prescribing before (19.2%) versus after (79.6%) pathway implementation and a concurrent significant decline in oral third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime) prescribing from 50.3% to 4.0%. There was no significant increase in 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, or inpatient admissions for UTI.

Conclusions

A clinical pathway produced a significant and sustained increase in narrow-spectrum empiric antibiotic prescribing for pediatric UTI. Increased empiric cephalexin prescribing did not result in increased treatment failures or adverse patient outcomes. Future studies on implementing clinical pathways for children outside a pediatric hospital network are needed.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^a0a5a82c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^0e808fc1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

AAP urinary tract infection guideline — febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age: Action Statement 1 states that if a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA), because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^a301ace9]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1ec80859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^7a4a0118]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

RESULTS

What Is the Definition of cUTI?

cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D).
Children with cUTI have one or more of: localized risk: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple recurrent UTI, generalized risk: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal) and severe clinical presentations: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease.
We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course, variably including severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants, but due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children with pyelonephritis, children with known anatomical or functional abnormalities, extensive parenchymal involvement, septicemia, nosocomial acquisition, renal impairment and recent antibiotics. The limited number of pediatric studies addressing cUTI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1a, and 1b,), have used various definitions, from comprehensive to brief to single complication.– Regarding the cUTI definition in existing guidelines for childhood UTI management, the updated National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline for childhood UTIand recent Canadianand Swissguidelines used varying combinations of severe presentation, renal issues and failure to improve in their definitions, while the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrologyuses severe presentation as the only criterion.

### Cranberry products for the prophylaxis of urinary tract infections in pediatric patients [^c5efb76a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the existing data regarding the use of cranberry products for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A literature search of Medline databases from 1966 to June 2015 was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The databases were searched using the terms "pediatrics", "children", "cranberry", "cranberry juice", and "urinary tract infections". The identified trials were then searched for additional references applicable to this topic.

Data Synthesis

A total of 8 clinical trials were identified that examined the use of cranberry products, mostly juice, for the prevention of UTIs in children. Three trials examined the use in otherwise healthy children. Five trials examined the use in pediatric patients with underlying urogenital abnormalities of which 2 compared cranberry to antibiotics. In healthy pediatric patients, cranberry use was associated with a reduction in the overall number of UTIs and a decrease in the number of antibiotic days per year for UTI treatment. In patients with urogenital abnormalities, results were conflicting, with some studies showing no reduction in UTIs compared with placebo, but others demonstrating a significant reduction. However, cranberry products had similar efficacy when compared with both cefaclor and trimethoprim. All studies used a wide variety of doses and frequencies of cranberry, making specific product recommendations difficult.

Conclusions

Cranberry appears effective for the prevention of UTIs in otherwise healthy children and is at least as effective as antibiotics in children with underlying urogenital abnormalities. However, recommendations for cranberry dosing and frequency cannot be confidently made at this time. Larger, well-designed trials are recommended.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^9f3b9489]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that children receiving a short course (median 8 days) vs a prolonged course (median 11 days) of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pyelonephritis experience similar clinical outcomes. Although results did not achieve statistical significance, children who received a short course of antibiotic therapy may be less likely to have subsequent infections within the following 30 days with a more resistant strain of the same uropathogen (40% vs 64%). This finding adds to the growing body of evidence supporting shorter durations of therapy than traditionally prescribed for the treatment of common bacterial infections.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative effectiveness research study evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for pyelonephritis in children. Our data provide evidence that may help guide treatment recommendations for a common pediatric infection, particularly when combined with the high-quality randomized clinical trial data supporting shorter (5–7 days) durations of therapy for adults with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, our study included populations frequently excluded from traditional comparative effectiveness UTI studies, including those with immunocompromised systems, structural urologic abnormalities, and previous UTIs, increasing the generalizability of our findings to the pediatric population at highest risk for the development of pyelonephritis.

We found that children aged 4 to 13 years had a significantly higher odds of treatment failure (regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed) than children aged less than 4 years or greater than 14 years. We hypothesize that this finding was likely due to differences in risk factors in the aged 4 to 13 years group compared with younger and older children. A possible explanation for the development of UTIs in healthy children less than aged 4 years is evolving elimination and hygiene practices during infancy and toilet training periods; whereas children older than 14 years are more likely to experience UTIs related to sexual activity. Children between these ages, however, are less likely to develop UTIs unless there are anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, neurological abnormalities, or functional bowel control conditions. The presence of underlying urologic abnormalities was independently associated with treatment failure, regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^f970fe5c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^ce643685]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

Antibiotic Prophylaxis Choice, Duration and Resistance

The most common agents used for CAP are amoxicillin in neonates and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin in older children. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cephalosporins lack data regarding efficacy and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Two RCTs showed that 6 months of nitrofurantoin was more effective at reducing recurrence than TMP-SMX, although nitrofurantoin resulted in more gastrointestinal side effects. Although both nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are generally considered safe for long-term prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin can also cause cutaneous reactions, while TMP-SMX can cause nausea and loss of appetite, and more rarely bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is therefore recommended not to use TMP-SMX in some hematologic disorders, to dose adjust in renal failure and to monitor full blood count and electrolytes while taking it. The benefits of nitrofurantoin, in terms of efficacy, are counterbalanced by the side effects of the drug, so overall there is little to choose between recommending nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX for prophylaxis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that nitrofurantoin had the greatest likelihood of antibiotic choices in reducing UTI in children but also showed daily cranberry products reduce symptomatic UTI by 59%, more than either TMP-SMX or trimethoprim. This finding included children with recurrent UTI and VUR. Given that all antibiotic use is associated to some degree with the development of antibiotic resistance, cranberry products offer a promising alternative.

There is a lack of evidence for prophylaxis duration or criteria for discontinuation. Pooled results from 3 observational studies showed that continuation of CAP did not prevent recurrent UTI after pyeloplasty, so this should be a reason to stop. There is insufficient evidence regarding the duration of CAP after ureteral reimplantation or endoscopic treatment of VUR. Most commonly, 3–6 months are recommended, followed by reassessment.

Multiple RCTs clearly show that while UTI is less common with prophylaxis, resistance to the prophylactic antibiotic is significantly higher. With resistance to either TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin, switching to the other can be considered, although there is a lack of evidence to recommend a switch after a breakthrough UTI. In case of resistance to both agents, one might consider a CAP disruption, as broader-spectrum agents may lead to UTI with increasingly resistant organisms to remaining oral alternatives.

For nonurologic underlying conditions affecting the kidneys, RCTs that did not exclude renal impairment showed no difference comparing ≤ 3 versus ≥ 4 days IV of a total of 8–15 days, although renal impairment was not analyzed separately. Postrenal transplant, expert opinion recommends 14 days total for febrile UTI/pyelonephritis, switching from IV with clinical improvement.

Although immunocompromised children were unusually included in a study of febrile UTI, numbers were too small to extrapolate findings of shorter antibiotic durations. A small study found children with cancer often have few classic UTI symptoms, so diagnosis and definitive treatment may be delayed. Immunocompromised children usually have multiple admissions and antibiotic courses, so they are more likely to have unusual bacteria or resistance. Once definitive treatment starts, there is no reason for prolonged courses in this or other chronic conditions (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For children with significant urologic abnormalities, the only study comparing total antibiotic duration included 23% with urological abnormalities and found no difference between 6–9 and ≥ 10 days in treatment failure/recurrence, although it did not analyze them separately. Two RCTs investigating IV duration for febrile UTI included 34% and 37% children with VUR, respectively, and found no difference between 3 and ≥ 7 days IV of a total 8–15 days. A retrospective study including 1930 children with urological abnormalities found they were more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 days than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days), but this was not associated with outcomes. A retrospective study including urological abnormality compared 1 day versus 2–3 days' IV (median total 10 days) and found no difference in readmission, although outcomes were not analyzed by urological abnormality. Recruitment is currently underway for an RCT of cUTI comparing 1 versus 3 days of IV of a total of 7 days of antibiotics.

For children with multiple recurrent UTIs, antibiotic duration should be tailored to each individual acute UTI presentation. Multiple antibiotic courses for recurrent UTIs increase the likelihood of resistance. Longer admissions (although not antibiotic durations) have been shown for ESBL-E UTIs than for non-ESBL-E UTI. IV treatment via hospital-in-the-home programs could shorten hospital length of stay. For resistant UTIs, a comparison of IV durations of ≥ 3 days with 0–2 days showed no difference in recurrence, although total duration was not reported. Definitive antibiotic treatment should not usually need a longer duration simply due to resistance.

### Association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^647e4593]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Gaps and inconsistencies in published information about optimal antibiotic treatment duration for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in pediatric patients pose a dilemma for antibiotic stewardship. Objective: Evaluate the association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence rates in children with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 2 to 17 years with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis and without renal/anatomical abnormality was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Database for 2013–2015. Results: Of 7698 patients, 85.5% had cystitis, 14.3% pyelonephritis. Duration of antibiotic treatment was as follows: 3 to 5 days for cystitis (20.4%) or 7 (33.6%), 10 (44.2%), or 14 (1.8%) days for any UTI. Recurrence occurred in 5.5% of patients. Covariates associated with increased recurrence risk included pretreatment antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.06–1.57), pyelonephritis on diagnosis date (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.03–2.00), follow-up visit during antibiotic treatment (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.20–4.68), parenteral antibiotic (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.33–2.69), and interaction of pyelonephritis diagnosis with nitrofurantoin monotherapy (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.20–11.29). After adjustment for covariates, the association between duration of antibiotic treatment and recurrence was not significant (compared with 7 days: 10 days: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85–1.33; 14 days: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45–1.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Antibiotic treatment duration was not significantly associated with recurrence of uncomplicated UTI in a national pediatric cohort. Results provide support for shorter-course treatment, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Changes in urinary tract infection hospitalizations post 2011 revised American academy pediatrics guidelines [^5046e6b1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple randomized trials over the past 2 decades have supported oral antimicrobial treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 revised American Academy Pediatrics guidelines on the management of UTI provide further support for outpatient management. It is unknown whether practice patterns have changed as a result of these developments.

Objective

To examine temporal trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012 as measured by the Kids' Inpatient Database.

Design and Methods

The Kid's Inpatient Database was used to analyze trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012. This triennial database is publicly available through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Hospitalization volume for clinical classification software principal diagnosis category 159 Urinary tract infection was examined for trends across years by age. Changes in length of stay and charges corrected for inflation were also examined.

Results

There were significantly fewer weighted UTI hospitalizations in 2012 compared with 1997 to 2009 (48 102 SE ± 1494 in 2009 vs 41 177 SE ± 1467 in 2012, P < .0001). The largest decrease was in 15- to 17-year-old (19.2%) and < 1-year-old (18.6%) groups. The length of stay trended down consistently, but charges have increased despite correcting for consumer price index.

Conclusions

Year 2012 represents the first significant decrease in national hospitalization rates for UTI since 1997, a trend that may be explained by the accumulating evidence supporting outpatient management in addition to recommendations from the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics UTI guidelines.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^3de602e7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Optimal pediatric outpatient antibiotic prescribing [^747a99f9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Optimal Antibiotic Prescriptions

An antibiotic prescription was deemed optimal if it was consistent with guideline recommendations for first-line antibiotic choice, duration, and both choice and duration for the specific diagnosis. Diagnoses, associated ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, and defined optimal antibiotic choice and duration of therapy were based on the eReferences in Supplement 1. When available, national guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC were used to establish optimal antibiotic therapy. Preference was given to pediatric national guidelines. If national guidelines were not available, widely cited articles (> 20 citations on Web of Science) were used. The range of optimal antibiotic duration for all diagnoses was deemed optimal if it was less than or equal to the maximum duration outlined in the guidelines (optimal choice and optimal duration columns in eTable 1 in Supplement 1) to account for antibiotic courses that may have been started in the inpatient setting but were finished in the outpatient setting. Therefore, all prescriptions with a suboptimal duration in this analysis were antibiotic courses that were longer than recommended. For example, if amoxicillin-clavulanate were prescribed for 7 days for streptococcal pharyngitis, that antibiotic choice would be deemed suboptimal, duration of therapy would be optimal (based on our definition), and overall choice and duration would be suboptimal. If multiple antibiotics were written for a single clinical encounter, each antibiotic was considered separately.

When results of more recent large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have led to recommendations for shorter duration of therapy than in existing guidelines (eg, 5 days of therapy for CAP,), we performed a secondary analysis using the newer RCT-based recommendations to evaluate the potential implications for antibiotic prescribing practices. Shorter courses of therapy for pediatric CAP were supported by high-quality evidence and were the focus of the secondary analysis, but we also gauged the use of shorter antibiotic duration for other conditions with some supporting evidence, including uncomplicated UTIs (5 days), skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs; 7 days), lymphadenitis (7 days), acute sinusitis (7 days), AOM (age < 2 years: 10 days; age ≥ 2 years: 7 days), complicated UTIs (10 days), and intra-abdominal infections (7 days). The shorter courses of therapy supported by these studies are hereafter referred to as contemporary duration. All azithromycin prescriptions were excluded from this secondary analysis of contemporary duration because a 5-day duration is standard for azithromycin.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^bde0f1cd]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^7344a090]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^7f6c712c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children [^4efcfc33]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common occurrence in children. The management and laboratory diagnosis of these infections pose unique challenges that are not encountered in adults. Important factors, such as specimen collection, urinalysis interpretation, culture thresholds, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, require special consideration in children and will be discussed in detail in the following review.

### Emergency department revisits after an initial parenteral antibiotic dose for UTI [^a25e2cf7]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although oral antibiotics are recommended for the management of most urinary tract infections (UTIs), the administration of parenteral antibiotics before emergency department (ED) discharge is common. We investigated the relationship between the administration of a single dose of parenteral antibiotics before ED discharge and revisits requiring admission among children with UTIs.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of administrative data from 36 pediatric hospitals was performed. Patients aged 29 days to 2 years who were evaluated in the ED with a UTI between 2010 and 2016 were studied. Primary outcome was adjusted 3-day ED revisit rates resulting in admission. All revisits, regardless of disposition, served as a secondary outcome. Average treatment effects were estimated by using inverse probability weighted regression, with adjustment for demographic factors, diagnostic testing, ED medications, and hospital-level factors.

Results

We studied 29919 children with a median age of 8.6 (interquartile range: 5.1–13.8) months. Of those studied, 36% of the children received parenteral antibiotics before discharge. Patients who received parenteral antibiotics had similar adjusted rates of revisits leading to admission as those who did not receive parenteral antibiotics (1.3% vs 1.0%, respectively; risk difference: 0.3% [95% confidence interval: -0.01% to 0.6%]), although overall revisit rates were higher among patients who received parenteral antibiotics (4.8% vs 3.3%; risk difference 1.5% [95% confidence interval: 0.9% to 2.1%]).

Conclusions

Among discharged patients, a parenteral dose of antibiotics did not reduce revisits leading to admission, supporting the goal of discharging patients with oral antibiotics alone for most children with UTIs.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^56fd09b3]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The literature search performed during the 11-year period from 2011, when the revised American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on the investigation and management of a first febrile UTI in infancy were published, largely concurring with the earlier National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, demonstrated significant differences in approach between physicians and surgeons in terms of imaging, antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgery in the event of VUR detection. It should be clarified that this is not a systematic review or meta-analysis, which represent scholarly syntheses of evidence on a subject to inform healthcare decisions. While physicians have largely embraced evidence-based medicine, surgeons in many cases have not; thus, any systematic review or meta-analysis would potentially exclude large portions of the surgical literature and thus make any assessment of conflicting views between the two groups impossible.

An analysis of the papers identifies some indication of the justifications given by physicians and surgeons for the divergence of opinion. Physicians as a group, in line with the newer evidence-based guidelines, advocate less imaging and intervention, and are inclined to adopt a "watchful-waiting" approach, confident that any significant abnormality, grade IV–V VUR in particular, should be picked up following a second febrile UTI. In contrast, surgeons as a group are more likely to recommend imaging to detect VUR, with antibiotic prophylaxis and/or surgical correction if it is detected, concerned that any delay in diagnosis and treatment could place the child at risk of kidney damage. This divergence of approach between physicians and surgeons often confuses the family of the child, regarding the choice of how to best proceed with the diagnostic and therapeutic process.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^f56c04c2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

### Abstract… [^b5ea81e2]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in children and are associated with significant morbidity. Up to 7% of girls and 2% of boys have had a UTI by six years of age. 1 The recurrence rate is 30%. 2 One in six febrile neonates has a UTI, 3 and it is the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three months. 4 Short-term complications may include sepsis, renal abscess, and acute kidney injury 5; potential long-term sequelae include renal scarring, recurrent infection, impaired renal function, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, and preeclampsia. 2, 5 Prophylactic antibiotics are commonly prescribed, but their use has questionable benefit and contributes to microbial resistance. 6–9. What Is the Role of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Children with UTIs. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been used to prevent recurrent UTIs and renal scarring. However, its benefit is unclear, and it promotes antimicrobial resistance.

Patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis include children with a high risk of recurrent UTIs and those most likely to have adverse effects from recurrent UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is the preferred antibiotic for prophylaxis unless adverse effects limit its use. Bowel and bladder dysfunction is associated with UTIs, and treatment of this condition can reduce UTI recurrence. Evidence does not support the use of probiotics or cranberries for UTI prophylaxis. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Evidence is mixed on the role of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTIs. A Cochrane review and a systematic review suggest that long-term use of prophylactic antibiotics may reduce UTI recurrence; however, the benefit is small at best. 6, 7 The Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux trial showed that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced recurrent UTIs in children with grades I to IV reflux.

8 However, a Cochrane review showed little to no effect on rates of recurrent UTIs.
9. All of these studies show increased antimicrobial resistance when antibiotic prophylaxis is used to prevent recurrent UTIs. 6–9 Compared with other prophylactic antibiotics, nitrofurantoin results in less resistance and is more effective, but it has more adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomachache. 6, 7.

### Children with recurrent urinary tract infections: who are they and why do we need better prevention options? [^29467d3a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections in children, and those with congenital malformations of the urinary tract are at risk of recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), which can lead to renal scarring, chronic renal failure, reduced renal perfusion, and hypertension. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is present in 30% to 40% of children with UTIs, has been associated with rUTI. Other risk factors include the absence of circumcision, bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD), and fecal retention.

The standard of care for children at risk of rUTIs includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, whose effectiveness in preventing rUTIs and renal scarring remains controversial. Prolonged antibiotics use can lead to adverse events, and some studies suggested that prophylaxis does not reduce renal scarring and may increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, UTIs are often treated empirically, with treatment adjusted once the uropathogen's susceptibility profile is available.

Interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of rUTIs without the reliance on antibiotics are imperative, but the populations that would most benefit from this intervention remain uncertain. This study aimed to identify the pediatric population most susceptible to rUTIs in a urology clinic, evaluate antibiotic use and assess the risk of AMR.
