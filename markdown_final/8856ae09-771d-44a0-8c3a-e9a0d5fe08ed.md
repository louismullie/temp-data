## Question

Function of AM serum cortisol level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the function of the morning (AM) serum cortisol level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological basis of the cortisol circadian rhythm and why morning sampling matters. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where AM cortisol is used diagnostically, including adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid-induced HPA axis suppression, and post-pituitary surgery. Next, I will review validated thresholds and how to interpret indeterminate ranges. After that, I need to check confounders that can distort results and the role of dynamic testing. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical guidance and note special populations and assay considerations, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the physiological foundation. Cortisol secretion follows a robust circadian rhythm with a peak shortly after awakening and a nadir around midnight, driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and reflected in pulsatile ACTH-cortisol release; this rhythm coordinates metabolism, immunity, and stress responses, so a single morning value captures near-peak physiologic activity and maximizes diagnostic discrimination for HPA axis disorders [^98cb34b2] [^67b1f93b] [^2634140e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the clinical contexts where AM cortisol is most informative. Morning serum cortisol is the first-line test for suspected adrenal insufficiency, particularly central (secondary/tertiary) and glucocorticoid-induced forms, and is also used to assess HPA axis recovery after glucocorticoid therapy and to predict post-pituitary surgery corticotroph function; it is not recommended for initial screening of Cushing's syndrome, where late-night salivary cortisol, 1-mg dexamethasone suppression, or 24-hour UFC are preferred [^0cdeb055] [^84dad82b] [^76f4b067].

> I need to check validated thresholds and how to interpret them. For glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, guidelines suggest a practical continuum: values above about 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) indicate HPA recovery and glucocorticoids can be stopped; 150–300 nmol/L (5–10 μg/dL) is an intermediate zone where continuation and retesting are reasonable; below 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) suggests persistent suppression and warrants continued replacement and retesting; these cutoffs are supported by studies showing high diagnostic performance of morning cortisol versus ACTH stimulation, with LC-MS/MS thresholds of > 327 nmol/L excluding GIAI with 98% sensitivity and < 152 nmol/L confirming it with 98% specificity [^84dad82b] [^40b3ce2c] [^51949184] [^4db98de9].

> Wait, let me verify the broader adrenal insufficiency literature. In suspected primary or central AI, a morning cortisol less than about 3–5 μg/dL is strongly suggestive, whereas values greater than roughly 15–18 μg/dL make AI unlikely; indeterminate values in between should prompt cosyntropin stimulation testing, with a peak cortisol less than about 18–20 μg/dL confirming AI; these ranges align with Endocrine Society guidance and observational data showing strong rule-in and rule-out performance for very low and clearly high morning values [^0cdeb055] [^6390176d] [^051e98dd].

> I should double-check confounders that can mislead interpretation. Circadian disruption (shift work, jet lag, severe insomnia), altered binding proteins (elevated CBG from pregnancy or oral estrogens, low albumin/CBG in liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition), and assay heterogeneity can all shift measured total cortisol independent of true bioactivity; when binding proteins are abnormal, free cortisol (salivary or calculated) may better reflect tissue exposure, and clinicians should know their lab's assay-specific cutoffs because immunoassays vary substantially compared with LC-MS/MS [^21151571] [^6240aa22] [^aa3184fd].

> Next, I should review when dynamic testing is still needed. For indeterminate morning cortisol values, the 250 μg cosyntropin test remains the standard to confirm or exclude adrenal insufficiency; in glucocorticoid-induced AI, dynamic testing is generally not required if morning cortisol is clearly high or low, but can be considered in the intermediate range or when clinical suspicion remains high despite borderline values; in critically ill patients, total cortisol interpretation is complicated and free cortisol or context-specific thresholds may be preferable when available [^0cdeb055] [^6f8d48fb] [^862175eb].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In children, morning cortisol thresholds are broadly similar, with ≤ 3 μg/dL suggesting AI and ≥ 18 μg/dL essentially excluding it; in post-pituitary surgery, early postoperative AM cortisol can predict long-term function, but values at 6–12 weeks are more reliable than immediate post-op levels; in patients with adrenal incidentalomas, an 8 AM cortisol after 1-mg overnight dexamethasone > 1.8 μg/dL suggests autonomous cortisol secretion and mandates perioperative steroid planning if adrenalectomy is pursued [^7779b33e] [^d5c593c6] [^33b6095c].

> I will now examine the role of AM cortisol in monitoring recovery from glucocorticoid therapy. After tapering to physiologic replacement, measuring morning cortisol 24 hours off the last dose provides a pragmatic marker of HPA recovery; higher values correlate with lower risk of withdrawal or crisis, though biochemical suppression does not always translate to clinical events, so results should be integrated with symptoms and stress-dose education; recent data suggest routine SST after planned prednisolone cessation is often not cost-effective when morning cortisol is used judiciously [^84dad82b] [^81d191b0].

> But wait, what if the patient is on inhaled or intranasal steroids; could AM cortisol still help? Yes, dose-dependent HPA suppression can occur with inhaled or intranasal glucocorticoids, and monitoring morning cortisol can detect early suppression; if low, dose reduction, switching agents, or further evaluation may be warranted, though clinical significance varies and decisions should be individualized [^88dd74da] [^2dcacc62].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical guidance. AM serum cortisol is most useful when obtained between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding exogenous glucocorticoids for an appropriate washout (typically ≥ 24 hours, longer for long-acting agents), interpreted as a continuum rather than a binary, and contextualized with binding protein status and assay method; very low values support AI and warrant replacement, very high values argue against AI, and intermediate values call for dynamic testing or watchful retesting; in all cases, pair results with clinical assessment and provide stress-dosing instruction when AI is suspected or confirmed [^84dad82b] [^0cdeb055] [^21151571].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the core message is precise: AM serum cortisol functions as a convenient, physiologically grounded snapshot of HPA axis activity that leverages circadian physiology to screen for and monitor adrenal insufficiency, guide glucocorticoid tapering, and predict post-pituitary surgery outcomes; while powerful, it is not a universal diagnostic tool and must be interpreted in context, with awareness of confounders and a low threshold for dynamic testing when results are indeterminate [^84dad82b] [^0cdeb055] [^51949184].

Morning serum cortisol reflects **diurnal HPA axis activity** and is used to screen for adrenal insufficiency [^0cdeb055] and assess HPA recovery after glucocorticoid therapy [^84dad82b]. Levels are typically highest between 8–9 AM [^0cdeb055]; values > 10 μg/dL (276–300 nmol/L) suggest intact function, while < 3–5 μg/dL (< 83–138 nmol/L) suggests insufficiency [^0cdeb055] [^42c14fc0], and intermediate values require dynamic testing [^0cdeb055]. Morning cortisol is **not reliable for Cushing's screening** [^76f4b067] because it lacks specificity and can be confounded by stress, sleep disruption, or assay differences [^21151571] [^6240aa22].

---

## Physiological basis of morning cortisol

- **Circadian rhythm**: Cortisol secretion peaks shortly after awakening (6–8 AM) and nadirs at midnight, driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^98cb34b2] [^67b1f93b].
- **HPA axis regulation**: ACTH stimulates cortisol, which feeds back to inhibit ACTH and CRH, maintaining rhythmicity [^2634140e].
- **Factors influencing levels**: Sleep, stress, illness, and medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, estrogens) can alter morning cortisol [^21151571] [^6240aa22].

---

## Clinical significance of morning serum cortisol

Morning cortisol is a **first-line test** for adrenal insufficiency and for monitoring HPA recovery after glucocorticoid therapy [^0cdeb055] [^84dad82b]. It is not recommended for initial Cushing's screening [^76f4b067].

---

## Diagnostic thresholds and interpretation

| **Clinical context** | **Morning cortisol threshold** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| General population | > 10 μg/dL (276–300 nmol/L) | Likely intact HPA axis |
| Adrenal insufficiency | < 3–5 μg/dL (83–138 nmol/L) | Suggests AI |
| Intermediate range | 3–10 μg/dL (83–276 nmol/L) | Indeterminate; dynamic testing needed [^0cdeb055] |
| Glucocorticoid-induced AI recovery | > 10 μg/dL (300 nmol/L) | HPA recovery likely [^84dad82b] |

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Assay variability**: Immunoassays differ; LC-MS/MS improves accuracy [^21151571] [^4485109b].
- **Binding proteins**: CBG and albumin affect total cortisol; consider free cortisol in altered binding states [^6240aa22] [^b8c055af].
- **Circadian disruption**: Shift work, jet lag, and insomnia can lower morning cortisol [^21151571] [^f48ae882].
- **Stress and illness**: Acute stress can transiently elevate cortisol, masking deficiency [^notfound].

---

## Clinical applications

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Screen and monitor recovery; dynamic tests (e.g. ACTH stimulation) confirm indeterminate cases [^0cdeb055] [^84dad82b].
- **Glucocorticoid therapy**: Guide tapering and assess HPA recovery [^84dad82b] [^2ed99688].
- **Post-pituitary surgery**: Early morning cortisol predicts long-term HPA function [^ac0196b8] [^d5c593c6].

---

## Alternative and complementary tests

- **ACTH stimulation test**: Gold standard for confirming AI [^0cdeb055] [^81d191b0].
- **Salivary cortisol**: Noninvasive, reflects free cortisol; useful when binding proteins are altered [^6240aa22] [^b8c055af].
- **DHEAS**: Helps distinguish primary from secondary AI; low in both [^516de031] [^181fbd6d].

---

Morning serum cortisol is a **practical first-line test** for adrenal insufficiency and HPA recovery, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when indeterminate, confirmed with dynamic testing [^0cdeb055] [^84dad82b].

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency—morning serum cortisol testing is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy, obtained as a morning serum cortisol level measured between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours and only after reaching a physiologic equivalent daily dose such as prednisone 4-6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15-25 mg total daily dose. Given assay variability, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; in patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible and we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs, and if cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered. Supporting data include that in suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity, and in patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crises.

Background

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is the lethal condition in which the adrenal cortex cannot produce sufficient glucocorticoids to support the cellular functions and stress response of the human body. Due to its fatal condition, this disease requires an early diagnosis and immediate treatment. Multiple tests have been proposed to diagnose AI. Serum morning cortisol at 8 AM is an easy and commonly performed measure to screen for AI. If serum cortisol at 0800 h is < 3 μg/dL, it strongly suggests AI, while levels of > 15–18 μg/dL may predict normal adrenal function and AI can be ruled out. When the 0800 h cortisol falls into an indeterminate level and AI is strongly suspected, dynamic tests will need to be employed. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is a dynamic test that is usually conducted in clinical practice due to its safety, high reliability and accuracy. This procedure requires measurement of serum cortisol at 30 and 60 min after ACTH was administered at either a low dose (1–5 μg) or a high dose (250 μg). If the peak serum cortisol level after 30 or 60 min is < 18–20 μg/dL, the diagnosis of AI is established. However, in some institutions, the ACTH stimulation test cannot be conducted due to the shortage of ACTH resources and/or no specialists, resulting in diagnostic difficulty. Recent studies have proposed novel cut-off levels for serum cortisol that could reduce the number of unnecessary ACTH stimulation tests. Most of these studies were conducted in the outpatient department. Currently, there is only one study that has proposed a proper inpatient cut-off level for serum cortisol.

Endocrine Society guideline—central adrenal insufficiency diagnosis: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central adrenal insufficiency and we recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level <3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level >15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL; peak cortisol levels <18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at least 18–24 hours after the last hydrocortisone dose or longer for synthetic glucocorticoids.

### The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill patient: does it really matter? [^f399a28f]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The definition of what constitutes a 'normal' adrenal response to critical illness is unclear. Consequently, published studies have used a variety of biochemical criteria to define 'adrenal insufficiency'. These criteria have been based on the baseline cortisol level or the increment in cortisol following corticotropin administration. However, in critically ill patients there are a number of confounding factors that make interpretation of these tests difficult. Furthermore, in those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids, there is no evidence that treatment should be based on adrenal function testing. In those patients in whom the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be important, this diagnosis may best be made based on the free cortisol level or the total cortisol level stratified by serum albumin.

Midnight serum cortisol test—role and diagnostic cutoffs: The guideline states that because the test is cumbersome, “we do not suggest its use in initial testing for Cushing’s syndrome,” though it notes assessment can be “in the sleeping or awake state,” and that higher thresholds trade sensitivity for specificity. For sleeping measurements, “a single sleeping serum cortisol greater than 1.8 µg/dl (>50 nmol/liter) had high sensitivity (100%) for the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome,” but specificity was poor; “a cutoff point of 7.5 µg/dl” provided “higher specificity (87%).”

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4-6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15-25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1-24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: <150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

### Don't use serum cortisol levels as initial screening for adrenal (...) [^46e884eb]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum cortisol levels do not provide high-end diagnostic accuracy or sensitivity when used as an initial diagnostic test. Late-night salivary cortisol samples employing an approved collection device, 24-hour urine-free cortisol, or a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be used as an initial test. These tests have a high diagnostic accuracy for Cushing syndrome. Multiple screening tests may need to be performed based on the variability of hypercortisolism in Cushing syndrome. Two measurements of abnormal cortisol levels with these tests are recommended for an initial diagnosis; further workup should be referred to an endocrinologist to make the final diagnosis. Each of these tests has different limitations and should be chosen based on the lifestyle and medical history of the patient. Patients with erratic sleep schedules or shift workers would not obtain accurate results from a late-night salivary cortisol test.

Women taking oral estrogen, those taking antiepileptic drugs, and pregnant women could have falsely elevated cortisol levels as CYP3A4 metabolizes dexamethasone with the dexamethasone suppression test. Urine-free cortisol tests require rigorous collection management and should not be used on patients experiencing renal failure, or those suspected to have mild Cushing syndrome. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be excluded before performing these biochemical tests.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^47c0756b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Pituitary surgery/apoplexy

All patients with sellar/parasellar tumours should be subjected to an assessment of HPA axis function, with perhaps the exception of those with pituitary microadenomas who are at a very low risk of ACTH deficiency. Patients should undergo post-operative interrogation of the HPA axis regardless of whether they had pre-operative ACTH deficiency as there is potential for these patients to gain functional recovery providing that viable normal pituitary tissue remains in situ.

ACTH deficiency is the most common deficit observed in pituitary apoplexy occurring in 50–80 % of cases. Due to its high frequency and potentially life-threatening effects, empiric parenteral corticosteroid is administered, when possible preceeded by blood drawing for serum cortisol levels. Pituitary function can recover following surgical decompression. Therefore post-operative re-assessment of the HPA axis is required.

A 08.00 h plasma cortisol can be measured on day 1–3 post-operatively in patients not treated with glucocorticoids and day 3–5 in patients covered with glucocorticoids once the dose is tapered down to physiological replacement with the second dose of hydrocortisone given early in the afternoon (if hydrocortisone is used) and the morning dose of hydrocortisone not given until after the sample is drawn. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding what constitutes a safe level of 08.00 h plasma cortisol. Patients with a 08.00 h unstressed cortisol of >400 nmol/L have an extremely low risk of ACTH deficiency and no further dynamic testing of the HPA axis is required. Conversely, patients with a post-operative 08.00 h cortisol of <100 nmol/L are invariably ACTH deficient and glucocorticoid replacement should be commenced. Patients with a 08.00 h cortisol between these values require definitive testing.

The alternative, and our preferred, approach is to routinely perform a dynamic test of HPA axis function 6–8 weeks post-operatively. This has the advantage of facilitating early discharge of patients post-operatively on empiric glucocorticoid replacement rather than waiting for day 3–5 cortisol values and may better identify those patients with later recovery of cortisol secretion.

Key messages

• Change in adrenal function is a dynamic process in ICU patients, but no guidelines are available to suggest how frequently serum cortisol level testing should be repeated.

• The present study suggests that the majority of long-stay ICU patients who did not improve clinically had decreased cortisol levels.

• The decrease in cortisol levels may lead to poorer prognosis, and more studies are required to clarify their importance.

• More data are required to draw a conclusion regarding whether steroid supplements are beneficial in ICU patients with prolonged critical illness.

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^8d6893b7]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Fluticasone propionate – other literature

FP has also been shown to suppress 8 am serum cortisol and urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio in a dose-dependent manner in a single-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study for 9 days in patients (n = 12) with mild to moderate asthma. Similar dose-dependent suppression of adrenocortical activity was reported in four other studies with patients with mild to moderate asthma from the same research group [-]. Interestingly, the suppressive effects of FP on adrenocortical activity were greater than those observed on osteocalcin or eosinophils.

A Cochrane review collected data on the effects of FP on HPA-axis function. Significant differences were not apparent between any daily dose of FP in the range of 100–1000 μg/d and placebo on basal plasma cortisol values or urinary cortisol excretion. However, the authors were not able to make a meta-analysis of the cortisol values. In another Cochrane review the same authors found no evidence for dose-dependent suppression of HPA function. However, no decent meta-analysis could be made due to limited availability of data. In contrast to these findings another meta-analysis found that FP exhibits a significantly steeper dose-related systemic bioavailability than BDP, budesonide, or triamcinolone when 21 studies of urinary cortisol levels and 13 studies of suppression of 8 am plasma cortisol levels were analysed. Thus, there clearly exists a discrepancy in the published literature concerning the systemic effects of FP.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^181fbd6d]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

Observations

Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (eg, high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (eg, hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low morning cortisol levels (<5 µg/dL), high corticotropin levels, and low DHEAS levels. Patients with secondary and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency typically have low or intermediate morning cortisol levels (5-10 µg/dL) and low or low-normal corticotropin and DHEAS levels. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing (measurement of cortisol before and 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin, 250 µg). Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 15-25 mg daily, or prednisone, 3-5 mg daily). Mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone, 0.05-0.3 mg daily) should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 100 mg intramuscular injection) to prevent or treat adrenal crisis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

### Current challenges and future directions in the assessment of glucocorticoid status [^47e1508f]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

GCs are essential hormones for the normal functioning of most organ systems in the body with both GC excess and GC deficiency leading to adverse health consequences. However, symptoms can be nonspecific, and reliance on cortisol levels alone as a readout of GC status can be unreliable. Dynamic tests used to make diagnoses are based on historical cut-off values and aim to detect more profound abnormalities in GC status. Moreover, cortisol values can be challenged due to a number of factors, including the pulsatile nature of cortisol secretion, interindividual variation in cortisol binding proteins, local tissue availability dictated by 11 β-HSD activity, and GC receptor sensitivity.

Downstream markers of GC action may provide an objective method to assess GC status. Such markers include those reflecting metabolomic and epigenetic changes. A comprehensive multiomic approach, applied in concert with serum GC levels, assessment of clinical symptoms and signs such as weight change and metabolic parameters, along with other markers of cortisol action, could enable a comprehensive and objective assessment of GC status in the future.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Conclusion

Many ICU patients have decreased cortisol levels after prolonged treatment without clinical improvement. Whether there is an adaptation or exhaustion of adrenal function is still to be established. We propose that serum cortisol level testing be repeated in patients with prolonged critical illness, even in those whose initial adrenal function is within normal limits.

Alternate Day Therapy

Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.

The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day.

A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2. 
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7—If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is >300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is <150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to sustained stress after major burn injury in children [^265c514c]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2006). Low credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for stress response after injury, yet its function after severe burn injury in children is unclear. The purpose of this study was to define the effects of burn injury on the HPA axis and to evaluate the utility of total serum cortisol in measuring adrenal function in children with major burns in the 2 months after injury. Children ages 0 to 17 years who were admitted within 72 hours to our pediatric burn center with 20% TBSA or greater full-thickness burns were eligible for the study. Serum total cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), dehydroepiandrosterone, vasopressin, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score, serum albumin level, and electrolytes were obtained on admission and weekly for 8 weeks. An ACTH stimulation test (250 microg for children >2 years, 125 microg for children < or =2 years) was administered weekly at 8:00 am. Total serum cortisol was measured before and 60 minutes after the administration of ACTH. Twenty-five children with mean age 7.6 +/- 1.1 years and TBSA burn 41.8 +/- 3.8% were enrolled in the study. Baseline total serum cortisol was 12.4 +/- 0.7 microg/dl in the 8 weeks after injury and increased to 24.4 +/- 0.8 microg/dl after the administration of ACTH. Cortisol level did not correlate with PRISM score, albumin, vasopressin, ACTH, or mortality. Although the adrenal response to acute and chronic stress is intact after severe burn injury, the ACTH/adrenal feedback loop is disrupted. Random total serum cortisol measurements overestimate adrenal dysfunction; thus, ACTH stimulation testing should be used to assess adrenal function before the administration of exogenous steroids.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^42c14fc0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI)—interim morning cortisol strategy when corticotropin stimulation is not feasible: We suggest using a morning cortisol <140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency; this suggestion is only applicable in acute situations when waiting for the corticotropin stimulation would unnecessarily delay appropriate therapy and should not be used for community-based screening. In the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids, a basal cortisol <140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) drawn in the morning (6 to 10 AM) is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, although the choice of a morning cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency with 100% sensitivity is controversial, with studies arguing levels from >285 nmol/L (10.3 μg/dL) to >480 nmol/L (17 μg/dL), and there is no evidence to support the use of random cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency. The cortisol of 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) is typically below or near the lower limit of normal (6 to 10 AM) in reference populations for assays in contemporary clinical laboratories: 113–131 nmol/L (4.1–4.7 μg/dL).

### Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings [^7779b33e]. Journal of Investigative Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric adrenal insufficiency (AI)—hormonal diagnosis and provocative testing thresholds are as follows: Primary AI is suggested by morning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) greater than 100 pg/mL with cortisol less than 10 mcg/dL, or ACTH twofold above the upper limit with cortisol less than 5 mcg/dL; an 8:00 AM cortisol of ≤3 mcg/dL is highly suggestive, whereas ≥18 mcg/dL essentially excludes AI. In acute illness, a random cortisol and ACTH should be obtained prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy, and a serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL during acute illness can be indicative of AI. When levels are equivocal, cosyntropin testing should be done; for suspected primary AI, the usual high‑dose is 15 mcg/kg in neonates, 125 mcg in infants <2 years, and 250 mcg in older children; in secondary AI, either high‑ or low‑dose cosyntropin (1 mcg) has been used to evaluate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis; regardless of dose, a serum cortisol level >18 mcg/dL rules out AI, and the 1 mcg dilution should be given intravenously without a ‘fluorinated ethylene propylene’ catheter.

For serum cortisol measured by LC-MS/MS, a value > 327 nmol/L (>11.8 μg/dL) resulted in a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 99% for excluding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and a value <152 nmol/L (<5.5 μg/dL) resulted in a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 99% for confirming glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

The quality of evidence was moderate due to applicability concerns and the numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions on the value of morning cortisol as stand-alone test to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Importantly, test results of both serum cortisol and 250 µg ACTH(1-24)-test were not related to clinical endpoints such as adrenal crisis.

Clinical Question III: What Is the Diagnostic Accuracy of a Morning Cortisol Value vs 250 μg ACTH (1-24)-test in Diagnosing Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs 250 µg ACTH (1-24)-test. Of note, in the studies of Sagar et al and Sbardella et al ACTH (1-24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1-24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay. In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol < 100 nmol/L (< 3.6 μg/dL) failed ACTH (1-24)-test, while all patients with morning cortisol >350 nmol/L (>12.6 μg/dL) passed ACTH (1-24)-test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1-24)-testing in included studies). The results of the study by Sbardella et al showed that morning cortisol ≥336 nmol/L (≥12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1-24)-test, and morning cortisol ≤124 nmol/L (≤4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported. Debono et al found that a baseline serum cortisol >310 nmol/L (>11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors). A baseline serum cortisol < 152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) confirmed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a specificity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 95%.

Multiple Sclerosis 

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.)

Alternate Day Therapy 

Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.

The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day.

A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^98cb34b2]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Adrenal glucocorticoids are major modulators of multiple functions, including energy metabolism, stress responses, immunity, and cognition. The endogenous secretion of glucocorticoids is normally characterized by a prominent and robust circadian (around 24 hours) oscillation, with a daily peak around the time of the habitual sleep-wake transition and minimal levels in the evening and early part of the night. It has long been recognized that this 24-hour rhythm partly reflects the activity of a master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the past decade, secondary circadian clocks based on the same molecular machinery as the central master pacemaker were found in other brain areas as well as in most peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that misalignment between central and peripheral clocks has a host of adverse effects. The robust rhythm in circulating glucocorticoid levels has been recognized as a major internal synchronizer of the circadian system. The present review examines the scientific foundation of these novel advances and their implications for health and disease prevention and treatment.

### Transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection: do early post-operative cortisol levels predict permanent long-term hypocortisolism? [^0474ebef]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Prediction of long-term corticotropic deficiency

The exact cut-off value of cortisol serum levels to determine hypocortisolism and its appropriate timing of testing (laboratory value measured in µg/dl in morning serum) is still matter of debate. Published cut-off values range between 4 µg/dl, 8 µg/dl, and 14 µg/dl. In our study, we classified patients based on their actual clinical need of hydrocortisone substitution regardless of their serum cortisol levels, which may over- or underestimate the real fraction of patients suffering from hypocortisolism due to false interpretation symptoms such as fatigue. The measured and assessed cortisol cut-off value of 8.35 µg/dl is congruent with and within the range of published data. Patients with basal serum cortisol levels above > 10 µg/dl were declared as “ hypocortisolism” if they still presented with symptoms of hypocortisolism and had the clinical need for hydrocortisone supplementation when the hydrocortisone administration was reduced (mostly symptoms of fatigue). False high basal cortisol levels due to either ingestion of hydrocortisone before blood testing (24 h off replacement hydrocortisone) or even factitious ingestion of hydrocortisone were tried to be accounted for but cannot be excluded completely and may increase the uncertainty around a specific “cut-off” value for intact corticotroph function. Values from patients stating they had their hydrocortisone medication or food/ coffee intake before the blood was taken were of course excluded from analysis.

In our department, hydrocortisone supplementation is usually continued for 6 to 12 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery until the following endocrine laboratory testing, regardless of the assessed postoperative cortisol serum values. Side effects of supplementary (unnecessary) hydrocortisone administration could be prevented if the post-operative basal cortisol level or timing was more reliable and as early as possible, and direct postoperative testing obsolete if the positive predictive value is inferior to the long-term testing. Unfortunately, we did not assess possible consequences of supplementary (over-substituted) hydrocortisone substitution in terms of possible side effects such as high blood pressure, diabetic complications, or osteoporosis. In order to assess the complete impact of false hydrocortisone administration, a prospective analysis of patients suffering from pituitary adenoma would be necessary, with a close attention to signs of under- or over-supplementation. Neither did we assess economic differences in term of cost-effectiveness of early versus late assessment of serum cortisol values and correct hydrocortisone substitution.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^babd54d8]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In rodent studies, the sex differences in HPA axis function are consistent, demonstrating elevated basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels in female rodents (regardless of the stressor) with more frequent and greater amplitude of secretory pulses measured when assessing diurnal rhythmicity. In humans, sex differences are not as well defined, depending on the timing of assessment (basal vs stressed) and the nature of the stressor. No difference was found in serum cortisol levels between men and women when sampled every 15 minutes for 24 hours, despite an increase in the pulse frequency, amplitude, mean ACTH, and area under the curve (AUC) for ACTH in male subjects, suggesting there may be differences in either ACTH sensitivity or negative feedback regulation between males and females.

Differences between sexes alter with age, particularly in female individuals, which vary with impact of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormonal changes. Young female individuals have lower basal ACTH. Basal cortisol levels are elevated in the follicular compared to luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when measured both in serum (total) or saliva (free). In the extremis, HPA axis function becomes progressively more altered from normal physiology through the course of pregnancy, with eventual development of positive, placental CRH–driven feed-forward regulation and exceedingly high cortisol levels approaching parturition. As women age, CBG decreases compared to men, but this is not associated with changes in free cortisol. Relative to men, older data suggest lower mean 24-hour cortisol levels in premenopausal women, a difference that was lost following menopause, suggesting a relative greater increase in total serum cortisol as women age. This is associated with a delay in the onset and shortening of duration of the “quiescent phase” (cortisol persistently < 138 nmol/L) of the diurnal cycle which was more pronounced in aging women.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^8d4780a2]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The absence or the marked dampening of cortisol circadian variations in Cushing’s syndrome has obvious diagnostic implications because the time of day when blood samples are obtained has to be taken into account in the evaluation of the result. Differentiation between normal and pathological levels is greatly improved by adequately selecting the sampling time because the overlap between normal individual values and values in patients with Cushing’s syndrome is minimal during a 4-hour interval centered around midnight. The reduced amplitude of the circadian cortisol rhythm associated with higher nadir levels is, in clinical practice, an early marker of hypercortisolism in humans, and the evaluation of cortisol levels during the normal nadir of the rhythm is a common screening test to diagnose Cushing’s syndrome. Moreover, the gradual recovery of a normal circadian variation in circulating cortisol levels is also a clinical marker of the cure of Cushing’s syndrome, reflecting a normalization of the entire neural regulation of the HPA axis. In contrast, the persistence of a dampening of the cortisol rhythm, even when absolute cortisol concentrations in blood or urine are within the normal range, usually predicts a relapse of the disease.

Lastly, Cushing’s syndrome may also result from ectopic ACTH secretion from a nonpituitary tumor. In this case, ACTH release from the tumor is not under circadian control, and reproducible 24-hour variations in GC are not detectable.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^2634140e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms and the HPA axis

The HPA axis is a classical endocrine feedback loop; hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin stimulate pituitary release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates cortisol secretion, cortisol then completes the loop through negative feedback at both the hypothalamus and pituitary. The HPA axis begins to function from week 6 of fetal life but is quiescent throughout most of gestation.Close to term, a rise in corticosteroid concentrations is thought to support adaption to parturition and it is possible that maternal or fetal stress, through increasing glucocorticoid production, may trigger preterm birth.The HPA axis is immature at birth, although the elements of the circadian system are present and even preterm infants will respond to light and dark triggers.The development of the neonatal and childhood cortisol circadian rhythms has been variously reported (table 1). During the first weeks of life there is no evident circadian rhythm, however, within 2 months from delivery the HPA axis demonstrates a recognisable rhythm with a cortisol peak in the early morning and nadir at midnight and this resembles the adult circadian rhythm by 9 months of age.Once established, the cortisol circadian rhythm is similar through childhood and into adult life with minimal reported differences with age and puberty. The HPA axis circadian rhythm is regulated by the central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN rhythm has an approximate period of 24.2 hours, such that it requires a daily resetting via the light/dark photoperiod to maintain a 24-hour rhythm.In adults, serum cortisol concentration has a nadir at midnight, rises from around 02:00–04:00 hours, peaks shortly after waking, declines over the day and is quiescent (though still with detectable cortisol concentrations) from around 18:00–02:00 hours.Interestingly, there is an ACTH rise shortly before waking that may be a trigger for waking and there is some day-to-day higher central control of this, such that people expecting to wake later in the day have their cortisol peak correspondingly delayed.The HPA axis also displays an ultradian rhythm with glucocorticoid pulses occurring approximately every hour and a quarter.A number of factors may influence the cortisol circadian rhythm and the cortisol rhythm itself regulates metabolism and human behaviour (figure 1). Most tissues in the body possess clock genes that are synchronised by the central pacemaker in SCN,and there is evidence that the circadian rhythm of glucocorticoids can act as a secondary messenger from the central pacemaker to peripheral clock genes.Changes in basal concentrations of steroids and disruption of the rhythm are caused by stress such as infection, and raised basal cortisol concentrations with loss of the circadian variability are linked to psychiatric illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

### Salivary cortisone to estimate cortisol exposure and sampling frequency required based on serum cortisol measurements [^3a43a3df]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Population studies frequently measure cortisol as a marker of stress, and excess cortisol is associated with increased mortality. Cortisol has a circadian rhythm, and frequent blood sampling is impractical to assess cortisol exposure. We investigated measuring salivary cortisone and examined the sampling frequency required to determine cortisol exposure.

Methods

Serum and saliva with cortisol and cortisone were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in independent cohorts. The relationship between serum cortisol and salivary cortisone was analyzed in cohort 1 using a linear mixed effects model. The resulting fixed effects component was applied to cohort 2. Saliva cannot easily be collected when a patient is sleeping, so we determined the minimum sampling required to estimate cortisol exposure [estimated area under the curve (eAUC)] using 24-hour cortisol profiles (AUC24) and calculated the relative error (RE) for eAUC.

Results

More than 90% of variability in salivary cortisone could be accounted for by change in serum cortisol. A single serum cortisol measurement was a poor estimate of AUC24, especially in the morning or last thing at night (RE >68%); however, three equally spaced samples gave a median RE of 0% (interquartile range, -15.6% to 15.1%). In patients with adrenal incidentalomas, eAUC based on three serum cortisol samples showed a difference between those with autonomous cortisol secretion and those without (P = 0.03).

Interpretation

Accepting that most people sleep 7 to 8 hours, ∼8-hourly salivary cortisone measurements provide a noninvasive method of estimating 24-hour cortisol exposure for population studies.

Midnight serum cortisol thresholds and diagnostic utility—children and adults: In 105 children with Cushing’s syndrome, measurement of sleeping midnight cortisol had higher sensitivity than UFC (99 vs. 88%). In patients with a high clinical index of suspicion who had abnormal UFC and full suppression on dexamethasone testing, a sleeping midnight serum cortisol of greater than 1.8 μg/dl or an awake value of greater than 7.5 μg/dl increases the probability of Cushing’s syndrome, whereas a sleeping midnight serum cortisol less than 1.8 μg/dl effectively excludes Cushing’s syndrome; in the context of anticonvulsant-related dexamethasone test failure, a sleeping midnight serum cortisol less than 1.8 μg/dl has been used to exclude Cushing’s syndrome.

### Associations of serum cortisol with cognitive function and dementia: the rotterdam study [^33448fc8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Higher levels of cortisol have been observed in persons with cognitive decline and dementia. It is unknown whether these higher levels are a cause or a consequence of disease. We investigated whether morning levels of serum cortisol were associated with cognitive function, cognitive decline, and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population based cohort study. Cortisol levels were assessed in fasting blood serum in 3341 participants, who were free of dementia at baseline (1997-1999). Cognitive function was assessed with a dedicated neuropsychological test battery at baseline and at follow-up examination (2002-2004). In addition, the cohort was continuously monitored for incident dementia until January 1, 2007. After a mean follow-up of 7.1 years, 243 participants had developed dementia, of whom 210 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Morning serum levels of cortisol were neither related to cognitive function at baseline, nor to annual cognitive decline. There was no relation between serum levels of cortisol and the risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that that morning serum cortisol is not a causal factor in the development of dementia.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^577a0601]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6—We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. 
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^7b45cef3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies assessing recovery of HPA axis function through measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1-24)-test were not formally included in the systematic review (see “Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints’), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at re-testing already after a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

Clinical Sub-question Ia: Which Clinical/Biochemical Parameters Predict Recovery of HPA Axis Function in Patients With Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency?

Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1-24)-test than patients without recovery (219 vs 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.02-2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values in between retesting with ACTH (1-24)-test than patients not recovering (286 vs 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.01-1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

Clinical question III—Morning serum cortisol vs 250 μg adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (1-24)-test: In glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, all included studies assessed this comparison, and specific morning cortisol thresholds showed high diagnostic performance. In Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol <100 nmol/L (< 3.6 μg/dL) failed the ACTH (1-24)-test and all with >350 nmol/L (>12.6 μg/dL) passed. In Sbardella et al, morning cortisol ≥336 nmol/L (≥12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for a normal ACTH (1-24)-test, while ≤124 nmol/L (≤4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. By immunoassay, baseline cortisol >310 nmol/L (>11.2 μg/dL) excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with sensitivity 98% and negative predictive value 97%, whereas <152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) confirmed it with specificity 97% and positive predictive value 95%. By LC-MS/MS, >327 nmol/L (>11.8 μg/dL) yielded sensitivity 98% and negative predictive value 99% for exclusion, and <152 nmol/L (<5.5 μg/dL) gave specificity 98% and positive predictive value 99% for confirmation.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CIRCI diagnosis—free cortisol versus total cortisol: We suggest against using plasma free cortisol level rather than plasma total cortisol for the diagnosis of CIRCI (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although free cortisol is the bioactive form, correlation between serum free and total cortisol has been reported as only 50% to 60%, and cohort data are mixed, including a prospective study of 112 critically ill adults showing good correlation before and after 250 μg ACTH, a cohort of 69 critically ill patients in whom both free and total cortisol predicted outcomes, and a 29-adult septic shock cohort with differences over time and after 1 μg ACTH; measurement of serum free cortisol is cumbersome and not widely available, and given the small number of low-quality, inconsistent studies, the task force suggested against measuring plasma free cortisol level over plasma total cortisol level in suspected CIRCI.

Statistical analyses

SPSS26.0 software was performed for statistical analyses. According to the tertiles of cortisol levels, patients were classified as G1 (2.8–120 umol/L), G2 (121-166.7 umol/L) and G3 (168–822 umol/L), with data presented as mean ± SD or median [25%, 75%]. Concerning continuous and normally distributed variables, we applied one-way ANOVA to assess trends across groups, whereas Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for anomalies. Chi-square test was adopted for categorical variables. The Spearman coefficient determines the relationship between cortisol and other variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the the independent correlation between cortisol and CGM parameters. We consider that P < 0.05 was statistically significant.

### Diagnostic performance of morning basal serum cortisol for assessing adrenal reserve: a single-center experience from the United Arab Emirates [^386058f4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition due to the lack of inherent cortisol elevation in response to any illness or stress. Adrenal insufficiency may still present as a diagnostic dilemma for healthcare providers, even 165 years after its first description in 1856.It can be directly related to reduced adrenal secretion of cortisol (primary), interference in the secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland (secondary; e.g. after traumatic brain injury or pituitary surgery), or a disruption in the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus (tertiary, e.g. after exogenous steroid intake).The cosyntropin/short Synacthen test (SST), which involves testing of serum cortisol before and after injecting with 250 mcg cosyntropin (Tetracosactide), is frequently used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and has replaced the gold standard insulin tolerance test in clinical practice.Determination of a morning cortisol value can help identify patients with sufficient adrenal reserve without the need for SSTs, and it has been proposed as a useful initial screening test; however, a consensus has not yet been established regarding the cutoff values due to varied results caused by different patient profiles, cortisol assay kits, and test timings.Recent guidelines have recommended a morning cortisol cutoff of 140 nmol/L paired with ACTH as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency. Other observational studies have indicated that morning cortisol levels of ⩽100 and ⩾450 nmol/L are useful markers to rule in and rule out the possibility of adrenal insufficiency with reasonable diagnostic accuracy. These tests may reduce the need for SSTs; however, the cutoff values for local population have not yet been verified.

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of morning basal to peak cortisol levels during the SST and identify a morning cortisol threshold that can identify patients with adequate adrenal reserve in our local population with >98% specificity and >75% sensitivity.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012? [^4dca3572]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm and patients still have an increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-h cortisol production rate with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice daily, weight-related, dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm is associated with ill health, and the few studies that have compared different treatment regimens. Further studies are required to definitively test the benefits of replacing the cortisol circadian rhythm in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Regulation of cortisol bioavailability – effects on hormone measurement and action [^6240aa22]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Routine assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis relies on the measurement of total serum cortisol levels. However, most cortisol in serum is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, and changes in the structure or circulating levels of binding proteins markedly affect measured total serum cortisol levels. Furthermore, high-affinity binding to CBG is predicted to affect the availability of cortisol for the glucocorticoid receptor. CBG is a substrate for activated neutrophil elastase, which cleaves the binding protein and results in the release of cortisol at sites of inflammation, enhancing its tissue-specific anti-inflammatory effects. Further tissue-specific modulation of cortisol availability is conferred by corticosteroid 11β-dehydrogenase. Direct assessment of tissue levels of bioavailable cortisol is not clinically practicable and measurement of total serum cortisol levels is of limited value in clinical conditions that alter prereceptor glucocorticoid bioavailability. Bioavailable cortisol can, however, be measured indirectly at systemic, extracellular tissue and cell levels, using novel techniques that have provided new insight into the transport, metabolism and biological action of glucocorticoids. A more physiologically informative approach is, therefore, now possible in the assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which could prove useful in clinical practice.

When interpreting the values of morning cortisol measurement, it has to be taken into account that several factors can affect the results. Cortisol production is affected by the sleep-awake cycle, with cortisol secretion reaching its peak just minutes before waking up. Thus, morning serum cortisol can appear falsely low in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythm (eg, night shift workers, jet lag, and severe insomnia). In addition, serum cortisol concentrations can be elevated in patients with elevated cortisol-binding globulin, such as seen during pregnancy and in women on oral estrogens. By contrast, serum cortisol concentrations can be decreased in patients with low albumin and cortisol binding globulin, as in hypoalbuminemic states (such as advanced cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition), and prolonged critical illness.

The interpretation of serum cortisol varies depending on the assays used. Available techniques for measuring serum cortisol listed from least to most accurate methods are immunoassays using polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays using more specific monoclonal antibody to cortisol, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For example, in a large study of patients undergoing 250 µg ACTH (1-24)-test, baseline cortisol that excluded adrenal insufficiency varied between 336 (12.2 μg/dL) and 506 nmol/L (18.3 μg/dL) when measured by three different immunoassays. Most prior studies utilized different forms of immunoassays, rather than mass spectrometry-based assays. Therefore, it is important to point out that, ideally, physicians should be familiar with cut-off values used in their laboratories.

Concomitant measurement of baseline DHEAS was reported to have a good diagnostic accuracy in making a diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency, including those with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Data on DHEAS use to diagnose recovery from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency are scarce, but suggest that normalization of cortisol secretion occurs prior to normalization of DHEAS, making it a less favorable laboratory value to detect adrenal axis recovery. In one study of 32 patients with history of endogenous Cushing syndrome, patients with ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome had lower DHEAS than patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome at the time of HPA axis recovery, suggesting that duration of adrenal cortex atrophy impacts androgen recovery.

A promising alternative is waking salivary cortisone or cortisol. This non-invasive and practical ambulatory test holds the promise of replacing in-hospital assessments to test for adrenal insufficiency, but is currently not widely available.

Cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity

According to the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, fasting serum cortisol levels analyzed 6 weeks to 3 months after surgery were more accurate in predicting long-term intact corticotroph function (area under the curve, AUC 0.808) compared to the directly postoperative assessed levels (AUC 0.740). Naturally, the AUC of long-term basal cortisol levels predicted the corticotroph function most appropriately (AUC 0.864) (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 
Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve showing the sensitivity and specificity of direct postoperative basal cortisol level, 3 months postoperatively and long-term, indicating a higher sensibility and specificity of the long-term cortisol compared to the direct postoperative cortisol level

The cut-off value for direct postoperative fasting serum cortisol level was 6.9 µg/dl (sensitivity 86.4%, specificity 56%, Youden-Index 0.424). For values measured after 6 to 12 weeks after surgery, the cut-off prognostic basal cortisol was 6.95 µg/dl with a sensibility of 94.1% and specificity of 68% (Youden-Index 0.621). Basal cortisol measured after at least one year after surgery had the highest prognostic power at a value of 8.35 µg/dl (sensitivity 90%, specificity 82%, Youden-Index 0.718) (Table 2).

### Diagnostic performance of morning basal serum cortisol for assessing adrenal reserve: a single-center experience from the United Arab Emirates [^ec74f165]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies have focused on the diagnostic performance of the baseline morning cortisol levels as a predictor of adrenal reserve. Variable cortisol cutoff values, based on the assay type, test setting (outpatient vs inpatient), timing, and underlying etiology, have been reported. Sbardella et al.reported that baseline cortisol levels for predicting SST with 100% specificity were 358 nmol/L for Siemens, 336 nmol/L for Abbott, and 506 nmol/L for Roche I in the outpatient setting with 30-min cortisol peaks to pass the defined test cutoff values of >450, >430, and >550 nmol/L, respectively. Another study using the Abbott assay confirmed that pretest morning cortisol (⩾343 nmol/L) can be a reliable predictor of SST outcome.A recent study evaluating home waking salivary cortisone to screen for adrenal insufficiency demonstrated that the comparator baseline serum cortisol cutoff value (⩾308 nmol/L) using the Roche II assay predicted normal SST response (peak cortisol defined as 430 nmol/L) with 96% specificity.Our results, incorporating the Abbott and Roche II assays, are in line with the previous studies; a baseline morning cortisol level of ⩾332 nmol/L corresponds to adequate adrenal reserve and obviates the need for ACTH stimulation.

Regarding a lower cutoff value for morning serum cortisol levels to confirm adrenal insufficiency, no clear consensus has been reached, and several studies highlighted the limitations of using baseline cortisol levels with variable cutoff values to confirm adrenal insufficiency. Some studies suggest that SST adds little value in patients having 9 am serum cortisol level of <100 nmol/L,and the Endocrine Society guidelines support the use of 9 am serum cortisol level of <140 nmol/L.In an observational study, Fragoso et al.reported that morning cortisol values of 42–100 nmol/L confirmed adrenal insufficiency with 98%–100% specificity. Our results demonstrated that a morning cortisol value of ⩽96 nmol/L can identify patients with adrenal insufficiency with low sensitivity albeit high specificity.

Our study incorporated both outpatient and inpatient SSTs. While the SST results may be quite different in these two settings, all inpatients included in the study were stable (not in intensive care unit settings or having any sepsis/acute severe infection), and all patients shared similar indications for performing SST. Therefore, combining these patient populations was practical, given our small sample size.

### How to interpret a single cortisol measurement [^96c1df92]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can present with non-specific clinical features. Therefore, a single cortisol measurement is often included in the biochemical work-up of an unwell child. This article aims to review the diagnostic utility of a single cortisol measurement by outlining the physiological, clinical and technical factors affecting result interpretation. Clinical scenarios are used to illustrate how this test may be used in different commonly encountered situations in general paediatrics, with the aim of minimising the frequency of inconclusive results.

### Changes in adrenal function and insufficiency symptoms after cessation of prednisolone [^81d191b0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that a 250 μg SST after planned cessation of prednisolone treatment is not cost effective as a routine follow up and could be restricted to patients with severe symptoms, which supports and strengthens the recommendations from a recently published guideline.This guideline also recommends the use of morning cortisol for assessing adrenal function with levels between 150 to 300 nmol/L a gray area. We collected morning cortisol (7to 9) from 22 patients, 7 of whom had cortisol levels between 150 to 300 nmol/L, all with a normal SST.

As mentioned, the SST provides a supraphysiological stimulus, and, to our knowledge, it has not been compared with features of endogenous cortisol secretion, such as production rate and circadian or ultradian rhythmicity or to symptoms and signs of AI. In this context, there is a need for additional biochemical tools to measure GC status during and after pharmacological GC treatment, but such a method must be tested rigorously in a clinical trial.A potential candidate for further scrutiny could be a recently published bioassay for quantification of glucocorticoid activity in serum.However, as it stands, the SST remains the criterion standard for diagnosing AI.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of our study include the rigorous and protocolled design within the framework of a randomized clinical trial and the fact that we invited all eligible patients with PMR and/or GCA in a nationwide study using state of the art cortisol assays. Our study did not capture patients unable to sustain prednisolone cessation of at least 2 weeks, which is a limitation that could have affected the prevalence of AI. Furthermore, nearly one third of the invitees declined participation, which could have introduced selection bias. Lastly, our definition of symptomatic AI is based on a questionnaire developed to detect symptoms in patients with primary AI.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^33b6095c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to evaluation for Cushing's syndrome, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to administer 1 mg dexamethasone PO at 23:00 to 24:00 for the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and measure serum cortisol at 08:00 to 09:00 the following morning; recognize that a serum cortisol level > 1.8 mcg/dL (50 nmol/L) suggests autonomous cortisol secretion. Consider measuring plasma metanephrine during adrenal venous sampling in patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion to help lateralize both aldosterone and cortisol secretion; recognize the importance of measuring early morning cortisol following adrenal surgery and prepare for a period of possible glucocorticoid insufficiency.

### The combination of afternoon and midnight salivary cortisol improves the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^c2445383]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is challenging and often fraught with many pitfalls depending on several factors. We compare the diagnostic performance of AM serum cortisol; 24-hour urinary free cortisol; and 0800 h, 1400 h, and 2400 h salivary cortisol curve (SCC) in 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test positive and negative patients.

Methods

Eighty-three subjects performed measurements of SCC by the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method, exploiting the circadian rhythm of cortisol.

Results

The reproducibility and specificity of the test identify patients with hypercortisolism in 95% of cases at midnight. Interestingly, when considering 2 specific points (1400 h and 2400 h) on the SCC, the success rate rises to 100%.

Conclusion

The evaluation of the 1400 h and 2400 h assays led to detection of the total number of patients with Cushing syndrome. Salivary cortisol curve analysis is a non-invasive diagnostic strategy associated with elevated positive predictive value for hypercortisolism capable of enabling diagnosis. In addition, it can be considered for management of patient outcomes and monitoring of Cushing syndrome pharmacological treatment.

### Perinatal maternal depression and cortisol function in pregnancy and the postpartum period: a systematic literature review [^f48ae882]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Measurement of cortisol

Cortisol in humans is secreted diurnally, with the normal pattern being higher levels at waking, a significant increase in cortisol concentrations 30–45 min after waking and a subsequent decline across the remainder of the day, reaching its nadir at midnight. The increase after waking is referred to as the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and is typically represented by the difference between cortisol levels upon awakening and 30–45 min after waking. CAR can be measured to obtain peak cortisol levels and an accurate representation of the diurnal pattern of cortisol is typically obtained from measurement of multiple cortisol samples coinciding with the normal circadian pattern across the day.

Cortisol can be measured through different substrates (blood, saliva, hair, urine) and measurements of cortisol concentrations may vary based on the substrate being used. For example, approximately 80 % of total serum cortisol is bound to cortisol-binding globulin and albumin (plasma proteins), while free cortisol (saliva and urine) is not protein bound. Thus, one possible reason for differences in cortisol measurements between substrates can be attributed to changes in cortisol-binding globulin and albumin altering serum cortisol concentrations, without effecting free cortisol levels. Furthermore, Kirschbaum and Helhammer et al. (1989) suggest that absolute values of cortisol found in saliva are usually lower than blood serum due to an enhanced conversion of cortisol to cortisone (an inactive metabolite) in saliva. In terms of urine samples, Jung et al. (2014) indicate that 24-h urine samples capture average cortisol levels but fail to identify fluctuations in concentrations across the day or the peaks and troughs following dosing. Overall, each substrate has a set of strengths and limitations that can influence measurements of cortisol concentrations and the choice of substrate needs to be consistent with the research question posed.

### Ciclesonide (Omnaris) [^2dcacc62]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Adrenal Function : In a 6-week trial in adolescents and adults 12-73 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, a daily dose of 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray was compared to placebo nasal spray. Dexamethasone 6 mg was used as an active control during the last 4 days of the treatment period. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour serum cortisol levels before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The difference from placebo for the change from baseline in serum cortisol AUC(0-24)was 10.4 mcg•hour/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 25.5) for 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. The effects observed with the active control (dexamethasone, n=18) validate the sensitivity of the study to assess the effect of ciclesonide on the HPA axis.

In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 32 to 44 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 45 to 61 patients per group) before and after 12 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks were -0.81 (-4.0, 2.4), -0.08 (-3.1, 2.9), and ‑2.11 (‑5.3, 1.1) mcg/day for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The mean AM plasma cortisol value did not show any consistent treatment effect with differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of 0.35 (‑1.4, 2.1), 0.12 (-1.5, 1.7), and -0.38 (-2.1, 1.3) mcg/dL for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des‑ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

### Transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection: do early post-operative cortisol levels predict permanent long-term hypocortisolism? [^f9d4ab0b]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery provides a minimal invasive treatment for pituitary adenoma. Our aim is to evaluate the endocrinological outcomes after adenoma resection focusing on the corticotroph function, and to identify prognostic factors for an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis function (HPA) and the reliability of postoperative early morning serum cortisol measurements. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients treated for pituitary adenoma from April 2006 to January 2019 in our neurosurgical department. Pituitary function was assessed pre- and postoperatively as well as at 6 weeks to 12 weeks and at 1-year follow-up. Two hundred eleven patients were included. Nine percent of the patients recovered from a preoperative adrenal insufficiency, 10.4% developed a new need for hormone substitution, and a long-term deficiency of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis was observed in 30.9%. Cortisol measurements 5 days after surgery had a lower area under the curve (AUC) than cortisol levels detected after 6 to 12 weeks (AUC 0.740 vs. AUC 0.808) in predicting an intact corticotrope function. The cut-off value determined for cortisol measured after 6 weeks was 6.95 µg/dl (sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 68%). Postoperative early morning cortisol levels seem to be less sensitive and specific in predicting long-term corticotroph function than measurements after 6 weeks and 1 year, emphasizing the importance of endocrine follow-up testing.

### The relationship of serum and salivary cortisol levels to male sexual dysfunction as measured by the international index of erectile function [^ae2c9856]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Cortisol (F), which is an adrenal cortical hormone, does not show changes in level with aging, but is increased by stress. 6 Cortisol remains constant after increasing during the period of sexual maturation at the same time as T. Cortisol is known to raise blood pressure and blood sugar levels as well as cause sterility and immune dysfunction. When we feel stress, fear or tension, sympathetic nervous activity is increased relative to parasympathetic nervous activity, and the penis is contracted. Blood cortisol levels are known to increase in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical system at the same time as that in which blood norepinephrine levels increase in the sympathetic nervous–adrenal medullary system when sympathetic nervous activity is dominant. Thus, ED may occur when cortisol levels are high. Although the cortisol level may reflect sexual function, there have been no earlier investigations of the relationships between these two parameters. Similar to Bio-T, bioavailable cortisol (Bio-F) is an active form that does not bind to globulin, and saliva cortisol (Sa-F) is secreted in the saliva as the free type. 7 Here, we developed methods to measure testosterone and cortisol levels in the blood and saliva by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). 8 We measured various hormones directly using this method and investigated the correlations of these hormone levels and sexual function on the basis of questionnaire responses from 105 patients.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^f9e03a18]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Adrenal—primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy: Evaluate AM levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, with ACTH flagged if > 2× ULN and cortisol if < 3 μg/dL, obtain a basic metabolic panel plus renin and aldosterone, and for indeterminate results consider standard dose ACTH stimulation testing defined by AM cortisol > 3 μg/dL and < 15 μg/dL; adrenal CT is advised for metastasis or hemorrhage. For all grades, Referral to endocrinology and Education on steroid stress dosing, emergency injections, and a medical alert bracelet or necklace, accessory, or system are advised. For G1 (asymptomatic or mild symptoms), Consider holding ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone; initiate hydrocortisone 15-20 mg in divided doses, titrate to maximum of 30 mg daily total dose, and add fludrocortisone starting dose 0.05-0.1 mg/d with renin response targeted to the upper half of the reference range. For G2 (moderate symptoms, able to perform activities of daily living), provide outpatient corticosteroid treatment at 2-3 times maintenance (eg, hydrocortisone 30-50 mg total dose or prednisone 20 mg daily), initiate fludrocortisone 0.05-0.1 mg/d, and decrease stress dose corticosteroids down to maintenance after 2 days. For G3-4 (severe or life-threatening, unable to perform activities of daily living), Hold ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone, provide inpatient management with Normal saline (at least 2L), IV stress dose hydrocortisone 50-100 mg Q 6-8 hours initial dosing, and taper stress dose corticosteroids down to oral maintenance over 5-7 days. Additional considerations include hydrocortisone diurnal dosing—Typically, 2/3 of the dose is given in the morning and 1/3 in the early afternoon—and dose equivalence where Hydrocortisone 20 mg is equivalent to prednisone 5 mg.

### Baseline morning cortisol level as a predictor of pituitary-adrenal reserve: a comparison across three assays [^aa3184fd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

The short ACTH stimulation test (250 μg) is the dynamic test most frequently used to assess adrenal function. It is possible that a single basal cortisol could be used to predict the dynamic response, but research has been hampered by the use of different assays and thresholds.

Objective

To propose a morning baseline cortisol criterion of three of the most commonly used modern cortisol immunoassays - Advia Centaur (Siemens), Architect (Abbott) and the Roche Modular System (Roche) - that could predict adrenal sufficiency.

Design

Observational, retrospective cross-sectional study at two centres.

Patients and Measurements

Retrospective analysis of the results of 1019 Short Synacthen tests (SSTs) with the Advia Centaur, 449 SSTs with the Architect and 2050 SSTs with the Roche Modular System assay. Serum cortisol levels were measured prior to injection of 250 μg Synacthen and after 30 min. Overall, we were able to collate data from a total of 3518 SSTs in 3571 patients.

Results

Using receiver-operator curve analysis, baseline cortisol levels for predicting passing the SST with 100% specificity were 358 nmol/l for Siemens, 336 nmol/l for Abbott and 506 nmol/l for Roche. Utilizing these criteria, 589, 158 and 578 SSTs, respectively, for Siemens, Abbott and Roche immunoassays could have been avoided.

Conclusions

We have defined assay-specific morning cortisol levels that are able to predict the integrity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. We propose that this represents a valid tool for the initial assessment of adrenal function and has the potential to obviate the need for dynamic testing in a significant number of patients.

### Association between cortisol and aging-related hippocampus volume changes in community-dwelling older adults: a 7-year follow-up study [^5eb65727]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Participant characteristics, serum cortisol levels, and MMSE and CDR scores

There was no significant difference in serum cortisol levels between men (72.32 ± 17.30 ng/ml) and women (76.60 ± 21.12 ng/ml) at baseline. Furthermore, the average interval between Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2 brain MRI examinations was the same in men and women. Moreover, no sex differences were observed regarding the prevalence of other risk factors or blood collection time (Table 1). Although the variability of cortisol levels was observed during the day in serum, no effect of blood collection time on cortisol levels was observed in these participants (Table 2). Overall, participant MMSE scores declined, and CDR scores increased from Timepoint 1 to Timepoint 2 (Table 3). Moreover, we adjusted for age and sex and analyzed the association between serum cortisol levels (Timepoint 1) and changes in cognitive function assessment (Timepoint 1–Timepoint 2 difference). The results showed that MMSE was not associated (Table 4), but high serum cortisol levels were associated with changes in CDR (Table 5). Additionally, of the 596 participants at Timepoint 1, we show comparisons such as age and cognitive function for the 70 participants for the final analysis and the other 526 participants who were lost to follow up (Supplementary Table 1).

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^d679a11d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Alternative diagnostic tests—limited utility for initial diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome: The diagnostic accuracy of various other tests previously advocated for the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome (urinary 17-ketosteroids, 1600 h or random serum cortisol levels, and the insulin tolerance test) is too low to recommend them for testing. Other tests, such as the loperamide test, have insufficient evidence for their diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, responses to etiologic tests (e.g. pituitary, adrenal or thoracic imaging, plasma ACTH concentration, CRH stimulation test, 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test) may be both abnormal in healthy people and normal in patients with Cushing’s syndrome and therefore are not helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^eeb7c5da]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

C. The 24-hour profile of glucocorticoid secretion is a robust marker of the central circadian signal

Consistent with its role as the main hormonal signal synchronizing the master circadian pacemaker with a multitude of peripheral clocks, the 24-hour cortisol profile is relatively unaffected by acute changes in environmental and behavioral conditions.

The mean profile of cortisol levels shown in Figure 8 illustrates the persistence of the cortisol rhythm after an acute shift of the light-dark cycle and sleep-wake cycle and in the absence of alternations between feeding and fasting. Eight normal young men were studied during a 53-hour period that included 8 hours of nocturnal sleep in total darkness, 28 hours of continuous wakefulness in a semirecumbent position with constant indoor light exposure, and 8 hours of daytime sleep. Caloric intake was replaced by an iv glucose infusion at a constant rate. It can be seen that the overall wave shape of the profile was only modestly affected by the absence of sleep or the presence of sleep at an abnormal time of day. During the 28 hours of constant recumbent posture, continuous wakefulness, constant exposure to indoor light, and constant caloric intake, the normal wave shape of the rhythm of GC release was clearly maintained. Similar findings have been obtained in multiple laboratories.

Figure 8. 
Mean profiles of plasma cortisol concentrations measured at 20-minute intervals from eight healthy young men studied over a 53-hour period including a night of nocturnal sleep (black bar), 28 hours of continuous wakefulness in a semirecumbent position with a night of total sleep deprivation (red bar), and an 8-hour period of daytime recovery sleep (blue bar). Caloric intake was exclusively in the form of an iv glucose infusion at a constant rate. The persistence of the circadian rhythmicity of plasma cortisol despite these drastic manipulations of the light-dark cycle, sleep-wake cycle, and feeding schedule is evident. Note that the absence of wake-sleep and sleep-wake transitions during the night of total sleep deprivation results in a slight dampening of the amplitude of the circadian variation. [Redrawn from E.

### Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function during critical illness: limitations of current assessment methods [^862175eb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis represents one of several important responses to stressful events and critical illnesses. Despite a large volume of published data, several controversies continue to be debated, such as the definition of normal adrenal response, the concept of relative adrenal insufficiency, and the use of glucocorticoids in the setting of critical illness.

Objectives

The primary objective was to review some of the modulating factors and limitations of currently used methods of assessing HPA function during critical illness and provide alternative approaches in that setting.

Design

This was a critical review of relevant data from the literature with inclusion of previously published as well as unpublished observations by the author. Data on HPA function during three different forms of critical illnesses were reviewed: experimental endotoxemia in healthy volunteers, the response to major surgical procedures in patients with normal HPA, and the spontaneous acute to subacute critical illnesses observed in patients treated in intensive care units.

Setting

The study was conducted at an academic medical center.

Patients/Participants

Participants were critically ill subjects.

Intervention

There was no intervention.

Main Outcome Measure

The main measure was to provide data on the superiority of measuring serum free cortisol during critical illness as contrasted to those of total cortisol measurements.

Results

Serum free cortisol measurement is the most reliable method to assess adrenal function in critically ill, hypoproteinemic patients. A random serum free cortisol is expected to be 1.8 microg/dl or more in most critically ill patients, irrespective of their serum binding proteins. Because the free cortisol assay is not currently available for routine clinical use, alternative approaches to estimate serum free cortisol can be used. These include calculated free cortisol (Coolens' method) and determining the free cortisol index (ratio of serum cortisol to transcortin concentrations). Preliminary data suggest that salivary cortisol measurements might be another alternative approach to estimating the free cortisol in the circulation. When serum binding proteins (albumin, transcortin) are near normal, measurements of total serum cortisol continue to provide reliable assessment of adrenal function in critically ill patients, in whom a random serum total cortisol would be expected to be 15 microg/dl or more in most patients. In hypoproteinemic critically ill subjects, a random serum total cortisol level is expected to be 9.5 microg/dl or more in most patients. Data on Cosyntropin-stimulated serum total and free cortisol levels should be interpreted with the understanding that the responses in critically ill subjects are higher than those of healthy ambulatory volunteers. The Cosyntropin-induced increment in serum total cortisol should not be used as a criterion for defining adrenal function, especially in critically ill patients.

Conclusions

The routine use of glucocorticoids during critical illness is not justified except in patients in whom adrenal insufficiency was properly diagnosed or others who are hypotensive, septic, and unresponsive to standard therapy. When glucocorticoids are used, hydrocortisone should be the drug of choice and should be given at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. The hydrocortisone dose (50 mg every 6 h) that is mistakenly labeled as low-dose hydrocortisone leads to excessive elevation in serum cortisol to values severalfold greater than those achieved in patients with documented normal adrenal function. The latter data should call into question the current practice of using such doses of hydrocortisone even in the adrenally insufficient subjects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^67b1f93b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid physiology and dose equivalence—Glucocorticoids are secreted in a pulsatile and circadian rhythm with a morning peak and a nadir around midnight. Mean cortisol production is about 5–8 mg/m2/d, which is equivalent to an oral replacement with 15–25 mg/d of hydrocortisone or 20–35 mg of cortisone acetate in adults. In most industrialized countries, hydrocortisone is the preferred pharmacological replacement agent, but cortisone acetate is also in widespread use, and in a number of countries only prednisolone is available. Because of the short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone (approximately 90 min), multiple dosing is recommended; the first and largest dose is suggested upon awakening, the second after lunch, and, with a three-dose regimen, the last and smallest dose not later than 4–6 hours before bedtime.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^824a8fc3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing disease (CD) postoperative remission assessment—Remission is associated with younger age, smaller adenoma, and morning serum cortisol of < 1 µg/dL after surgery, and the initial remission rate for microadenomas was greater than for macroadenomas (72.8 vs 42.9%). In patients with mild or cyclic Cushing’s syndrome or those rendered eucortisolemic preoperatively, clinicians must measure late-night serum or salivary cortisol; if there is a normal diurnal rhythm with an appropriately low late-night serum or salivary cortisol level, it is likely that the patient is in remission, whereas lack of a diurnal rhythm suggests persistent disease. After bilateral adrenalectomy, serum cortisol is undetectable and morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are often between 200 and 500 pg/mL; after resecting an adrenal adenoma, morning cortisol values are generally < 1.8 µg/dL (50 nmol/L).

Mean (+SEM) 28-hour profiles of plasma cortisol (top), plasma glucose (lower left) and serum insulin (lower right) in 10 healthy adults who participated in a 10-day laboratory “forced desynchrony” protocol, where sleep (shown by the large vertical gray shaded areas) and meals (shown by the small vertical gray shaded areas) were scheduled on a recurring 28-hour cycle, a periodicity out of the range of entrainment of the central circadian pacemaker. Subjects ate four meals (designated as breakfast, B; lunch, L; dinner, D; and snack, S) during each 28-hour “day.” Curves shown in black represent the profiles observed when the sleep-wake and meal schedules were aligned with the 24-hour cycle, whereas curves shown in red represent the profiles observed when the 28-hour “day” was 12 hours out of phase with the normal 24-hour day. Cortisol profiles were inverted during circadian misalignment, demonstrating no adaptation to the 28-hour schedule (as expected from a rhythm controlled by the circadian pacemaker). The postprandial glucose and insulin responses were significantly increased as compared to normal alignment, and the differences were also clinically significant. [Redrawn from F. A.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^4485109b]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency—future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Mean (+SEM) profiles of plasma cortisol (top panels), insulin secretion rates (ISR, middle panels), and plasma glucose (lower panels) in nine healthy young men each of whom participated in four studies performed in randomized order. In all four studies, endogenous cortisol levels were suppressed by metyrapone administration, and caloric intake was exclusively in the form of a constant glucose infusion. Dark horizontal bars represent the scheduled sleep periods. The daily cortisol elevation was restored by oral administration of hydrocortisone (or placebo—data not illustrated) either at the normal time of the circadian peak (5, left panels) or 12 hours out of phase (5, right panels). Vertical arrows show the timing of hydrocortisone administration in each study. Horizontal lines on the ISR and glucose graphs show, respectively, the mean ISR and glucose levels at the time of hydrocortisone ingestion to facilitate the visualization of post-hydrocortisone changes. The initial effect of the hydrocortisone-induced cortisol pulse was a short-term inhibition of insulin secretion without concomitant glucose changes, and the magnitude of this acute effect was similar in the evening and in the morning. At both times of day, starting 4–6 hours after hydrocortisone administration, there was a delayed hyperglycemic effect that was minimal in the morning but much more pronounced in the evening, when it was associated with a robust increase in insulin secretion.

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome following treatment of endogenous Cushing syndrome [^c35372b8]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Biochemical assessment should begin once patients are taking a physiologic dose of glucocorticoid replacement (total daily dose of hydrocortisone 15 to 20 mg per day) and clinically feel well enough to begin the final stage to discontinuation of glucocorticoid replacement (Fig. 2). Biochemical evaluation begins with basal testing, and dynamic assessment of adrenal function might be necessary to confirm completion of recovery. For basal testing, patients should not take their afternoon hydrocortisone dose (if prescribed) the day before testing and then have a blood draw by 0830 prior to the morning hydrocortisone dose on the day of testing. While a serum cortisol alone is adequate to taper hydrocortisone, a simultaneous plasma ACTH assists in gauging the state of HPA axis recovery. Often the ACTH and cortisol rise gradually in parallel, but sometimes the ACTH rises above the normal range despite a low cortisol, which indicates recovery of the hypothalamus (CRH neuron) and pituitary corticotrophs in advance of adrenal function. Serum DHEAS can remain suppressed for months to years after cortisol normalization, and a low DHEAS does not indicate continued HPA axis suppression. A rapid rise in DHEAS, in contrast, is concerning for disease recurrence, but a slow drift to a measurable amount in parallel with the cortisol rise is consistent with HPA axis recovery. Periodic assessment of electrolytes is prudent to screen for hyponatremia and hypo- or hyperkalemia as medications are changed, particularly diuretics. Hypercalcemia that is parathyroid-hormone independent might be observed during the recovery phase, probably related to the rise in cytokines that accompany resolution of hypercortisolemia.

### Use of morning serum cortisol level after transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma to predict the need for long-term glucocorticoid supplementation [^ac0196b8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Object

Accurate assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is critical for appropriate management of the disease in patients with pituitary adenoma after transsphenoidal resection. The authors examine the role of the morning total serum cortisol level in the early postoperative period as a predictor of long-term HPA function.

Methods

Morning total serum cortisol was measured in 83 patients on postoperative Day 1 (or Day 2 if the patient received glucocorticoids during surgery) after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. These results were compared with those of definitive assays of HPA function performed at 1-3 months postoperatively, including cortrosyn/synacthen stimulation test (CST), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and metyrapone test (MTT). The ability of the early-postoperative morning cortisol level to predict HPA function was determined using standard confusion matrix calculations and receiver-operator control curve analysis.

Results

The authors found that an early postoperative morning total cortisol level>or=15 microg/dl is a sensitive and accurate predictor of normal HPA function in the postoperative period (sensitivity 80.5%, specificity 66.7%, positive predictive value 96.9%).

Conclusions

A morning total cortisol level>or=15 microg/dl in the early postoperative period after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas is a good predictor of normal HPA function. This test has good sensitivity and accuracy and correlates well with the results of additional, definitive assays of HPA function (CST, ITT, and MTT) performed at 1-3 months postoperatively. Accordingly, it is the authors' practice to avoid exogenous perioperative glucocorticoid supplementation in patients with normal preoperative HPA function and postoperative morning total cortisol levels>or=15 microg/dl 1-2 days after transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy.

### Pituitary society Delphi survey: an international perspective on endocrine management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas [^ca62310b]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Pituitary Society Delphi Survey—postoperative endocrine evaluation after transsphenoidal surgery includes monitoring sodium and early cortisol, timed full reassessment of pituitary axes, and targeted dynamic testing. Serum sodium should be monitored postoperatively, and morning serum cortisol should be monitored postoperatively (during an interval of 1–5 days postoperatively). Full evaluation of pituitary function should be conducted 6–12 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery. Dynamic testing should be obtained to evaluate the pituitary adrenal axis at 6–12 weeks postoperatively, if morning serum cortisol is not sufficiently high to assure sufficient adrenal function early postoperatively. Thyroid function should be assessed in all patients postoperatively (at 6–8 weeks), and dynamic testing may be obtained to assess GH secretion postoperatively in patients with clinical suspicion of GH deficiency.

### Serum morning cortisol as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency [^051e98dd]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To evaluate the performance of morning serum cortisol (MSC) compared to a 10 mg adrenocortico-tropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI). Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of ACTH stimulation tests were conducted. From a total of 312 potentially eligible ACTH stimulation tests, 306 met the inclusion criteria. The population was randomized into 2 groups: test (n = 159) and validation (n = 147). In the test group, the receiver operating characteristics curve test evaluated the diagnostic performance of MSC. Results: A subnormal cortisol response to ACTH was found in 25.8% of the test group. The area under the curve values of MSC to predict AI at +30 minutes, +60 minutes, or at maximal cortisol response were 0.874, 0.897, and 0.925 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 0.92, 0.83 to 0.93, and 0.87 to 0.96). The Youden index was 234.2 mmol/L with a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% CI 65.2 to 94.3%), and a specificity of 89.1% (95% CI 82.4 to 93.9%). Positive and negative predictive values were 64.1% (95% CI 47.1 to 78.8%) and 95.8% (95% CI 90.5 to 98.6%). There was no difference in age, gender, AI prevalence, or mean serum cortisol at +30 or +60 minutes in the validation group; however, a lower mean MSC value was found. Lower sensitivity and specificity values (88.3% and 60%, respectively) were found for the 234.2 mmol/L cutoff value. Conclusion: This study supports the role of MSC as a first-step diagnostic test in patients with clinically suspected AI. The short stimulation test could be omitted in almost half of the cases. Prospective and longitudinal studies to reproduce and confirm the cutoff values proposed are warranted.

### The role of corticosteroid-binding globulin in the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency [^b8c055af]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Cortisol is a hydrophobic molecule that is largely bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) in the circulation. In the assessment of adrenal insufficiency, many clinicians measure a total serum cortisol level, which assumes that CBG is present in normal concentrations and with a normal binding affinity for cortisol. CBG concentration and affinity are affected by a number of common factors including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), fever and infection, as well as rare mutations in the serine protease inhibitor A6 (SERPINA6) gene, and as such, total cortisol levels might not be the ideal way to assess adrenal function in all clinical circumstances. This paper reviews the limitations of immunoassay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the measurement of total cortisol, the challenges of measuring free serum cortisol directly as well as the difficulties in calculating an estimated free cortisol from total cortisol, CBG and albumin concentrations. Newer approaches to the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency, including the measurement of cortisol and cortisone in the saliva, are discussed and a possible future role for these tests is proposed.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: the added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^516de031]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

Methods

We reviewed the relevant literature, including our own data, on various biochemical tests used to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Results

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are helpful only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated, whereas baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are helpful only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level of this steroid is not sufficient by itself for establishing the diagnosis. A normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level, however, practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

Conclusion

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measurements of baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. In addition to these, determination of plasma levels of aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. With a random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is extremely unlikely. When serum DHEA-S levels are low or equivocal, however, dynamic testing will be necessary to determine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.

### Decreased morning serum cortisol levels in children with asthma treated with inhaled fluticasone propionate (...) [^88dd74da]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective. In an observational long-term study, we followed 62 children with moderate-to-severe asthma for 2 years and studied the effects of fluticasone propionate on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Study Design. Morning cortisol levels were monitored after patients had been on fluticasone for a mean of 8. 0 ±
5. 2 months. Patients who had abnormal low morning cortisol levels were then switched either to lower fluticasone dosage or to other inhaled steroid formulation. Exact methods based on the binomial distribution were used to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of abnormal readings among those treated, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test for a significant difference between cortisol levels taken before and after the switch. Results. Twenty-two patients had abnormal morning cortisol levels while on fluticasone.

Of the patients on a low dose, 17% had abnormal values, whereas 43% of patients on a high dose were abnormal. Patients with abnormal results had their morning cortisol levels repeated 3 months after the switch. Thirteen of these patients had normal levels. A stratified analysis of the difference in morning cortisol levels before and after the switch showed significant increase in morning cortisol levels in the group receiving 440 μg/day or less of fluticasone, as well as in the group receiving 440 μg/day or more. Conclusion. Inhaled fluticasone, even at conventional doses, may have greater effects on the adrenal function than previously recognized, but the clinical significance of this suppression still remains to be established.

### Adrenal insufficiency after operative removal of apparently nonfunctioning adrenal adenomas (...) [^4d61e368]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We describe a woman who developed adrenal insufficiency after removal of an apparently nonfunctional adrenal adenoma. She displayed no stigmata of Cushing's syndrome and had normal plasma and urinary cortisol levels. A second patient without clinical findings of Cushing's syndrome also had normal basal steroid levels. This patient displayed partial suppressibility with dexamethasone, had low-normal levels of serum corticotropin, and excreted a low concentration of urinary 17-ketosteroids. She also developed mild adrenal insufficiency after the operation. We believe the adrenal adenomas in these patients secreted enough cortisol to suppress the contralateral adrenal gland but not enough hormone to elevate basal steroid levels. Therefore, we suggest that all patients with adrenal masses be studied with the overnight dexamethasone suppression test rather than basal steroid hormone measurements to detect low levels of autonomous cortisol secretion.

In addition, patients with adrenal masses that are not removed surgically should have serial adrenal function tests performed. Huiras CM, Pehling GB, Caplan RH. Adrenal Insufficiency After Operative Removal of Apparently Nonfunctioning Adrenal Adenomas. JAMA. 1989; 261: 894–898. doi:

### Diagnostic pitfalls in Cushing disease: surgical remission rates, test thresholds, and lessons learned in 105 patients [^fd3714df]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

As previously published, blood draws for serum cortisol and ACTH were performed on postoperative day 1 and 2 (sometimes extending to day 3 postsurgery) at 6- to 8-hour intervals and those with cortisol below 5 µg/dL during the first 3 days were established as early remission. Cortisol supplementation was given in the perioperative period when biochemical evidence of hypocortisolemia was documented and/or clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency was present (eg, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, headache, arthralgias).

Assessment of corticotroph function and overall pituitary function (including thyrotroph, gonadotroph, and somatotroph function) were generally performed at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Sustained remission was defined as the need for glucocorticoid replacement for at least 6 months postsurgery and with clinical and biochemical evidence of eucortisolemia thereafter until the last follow-up contact. All patients were weaned off glucocorticoids as clinically tolerated until biochemical evidence of a recovered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function was achieved. For patients able to be weaned off glucocorticoids, subsequent assessments of corticotroph function included 24-hour UFC collections, and more recently with LNSC levels at 6-month intervals, as well as ACTH stimulation testing in most patients (often at the discretion of the referring endocrinologist). Sustained remission was defined as ongoing need for glucocorticoid therapy or normal 24-hour UFC and/or midnight salivary cortisol tests at the last follow-up.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2efe9d6f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Recurrence monitoring in Cushing disease—Recurrence is a more significant problem in adults, with one study reporting that after initial remission, 23% of adults with microadenomas and 33% with macroadenomas had recurrence, and overall recurrence rates vary from 15–66% within 5–10 years of initially successful surgery. Clinicians should evaluate patients for possible CD recurrence when the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovers, and then annually, or sooner if they have clinical symptoms; early recovery (within 6 mo) of HPA axis function may indicate an increased risk of recurrence. Elevated late-night serum/salivary cortisol is one of the earliest biochemically detectable signs of recurrence and almost always precedes elevated urine cortisol, and because diagnostic accuracy of proposed predictors is not high enough regarding long-term outcomes, clinicians must monitor every patient in remission from CD for the possibility of recurrence. Rarely, residual adrenocortical tissue can regrow due to prolonged adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hypersecretion; if patients become cushinoid after bilateral adrenalectomy, clinicians should test endogenous cortisol secretory capacity by withholding glucocorticoid for 24 hours and checking serum/salivary cortisol levels; recurrence after ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor resection generally reflects metastasis.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fa0c6726]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for Cushing's syndrome" for Cushing's syndrome.

The diagnostic criteria for Cushing's syndrome is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production. This tool is particularly useful in distinguishing Cushing's syndrome from other conditions with similar symptoms and from physiological causes of hypercortisolism, as well as exogenous corticosteroid exposure.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the exclusion of physiological causes of hypercortisolism and exogenous corticosteroid exposure, and the presence of certain biochemical abnormalities. These abnormalities include 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels above the upper limit of normal on two or more separate measurements, late-night salivary cortisol levels greater than 145 ng/dL on two or more separate measurements, and serum cortisol levels greater than 1.8 mcg/dL after 1 mg overnight dexamethasone.

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered likely if the patient meets the exclusion criteria and has either elevated urinary and salivary cortisol levels, elevated urinary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone, or elevated salivary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone. If these criteria are not met, a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, facilitating early detection and treatment of this condition.

To assess the likelihood of Cushing's syndrome, a structured approach based on specific diagnostic criteria is employed. This involves evaluating several key factors to understand the presence of hypercortisolism, the hallmark of Cushing's syndrome.

The initial step is to exclude any physiological causes of excess cortisol or exogenous corticosteroid exposure. This is a critical first criterion and serves as a prerequisite for further testing.

Following this, the user considers additional biochemical tests:

- **24-hour urinary free cortisol**: This test measures the amount of cortisol in the urine over a day. For Cushing’s syndrome to be considered likely, results should show cortisol levels above the normal upper limit on at least two separate measurements.

- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: Normally, cortisol levels are low at night. For this criterion, a reading of greater than 145 ng/dL (or > 4 nmol/L) on two or more occasions suggests a disruption in the typical diurnal pattern of cortisol production.

- **Serum cortisol after dexamethasone administration**: Dexamethasone is a synthetic steroid used to suppress cortisol production. If, after receiving a 1 mg dose overnight, the serum cortisol level remains greater than 1.8 mcg/dL (or > 50 nmol/L), it indicates a potential problem with cortisol regulation.

The conclusion about the likelihood of Cushing's syndrome is made by integrating these factors:

- The syndrome is likely if there is proven exclusion of other causes (the first criterion) and at least two of the following are satisfied: elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol, elevated late-night salivary cortisol, or failure to suppress serum cortisol after dexamethasone.

- If this combination of exclusion and elevation criteria is not met, Cushing's syndrome is considered unlikely.

This diagnostic pathway allows for a comprehensive yet straightforward determination, focusing on biochemical validations and excluding other possible explanations before arriving at a clinical interpretation.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f3ecd63a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Cushing’s syndrome diagnostic algorithm outlines that clinicians should exclude exogenous glucocorticoid exposure, then perform one of the following: 24-h UFC (≥ 2 tests), Overnight 1-mg DST, or Late night salivary cortisol (≥ 2 tests), with Use 48-h, 2-mg DST in certain populations. If results are normal, CS is unlikely; if abnormal, the algorithm directs clinicians to exclude physiologic causes of hypercortisolism (Table 2) and consult endocrinologist, and in certain populations it suggests Dex-CRH or midnight serum cortisol. Diagnostic criteria that suggest Cushing’s syndrome are UFC greater than the normal range for the assay, serum cortisol greater than 1.8 μg/dl (50 nmol/liter) after 1 mg dexamethasone (1-mg DST), and late-night salivary cortisol greater than 145 ng/dl (4 nmol/liter).

### Oral mucosal hyperpigmentation [^d31e1e16]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the next most appropriate test for diagnostic confirmation? 
A. Complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies
B. Colonoscopy
C. AM cortisol
D. Serum homogentisic acid
E. Late-night salivary cortisol

Answers: 
A. CBC and iron studies – Incorrect. CBC and iron studies would be helpful to evaluate a case of suspected hemochromatosis, which is characterized by a normal CBC with an elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation. A diagnosis of hemochromatosis could be confirmed by screening for HFE gene mutations.
B. Colonoscopy – Incorrect. With a suspected diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers or Cronkhite-Canada syndrome, colonoscopy would be an appropriate test. Both syndromes are associated with the development of numerous hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract.
C. AM Cortisol – Correct. Individuals with Addison's disease have low morning serum cortisol concentrations. In response to this decreased endogenous cortisol production, the pituitary increases systemic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The precursor to ACTH is pro-opiomelanocortin, which is also a precursor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The combination of increased ACTH and MSH results in stimulation of melanocytes and hyperpigmentation.
D. Serum homogentisic acid – Incorrect. Serum homogentisic acid is elevated in alkaptonuria, an inherited deficiency of tyrosine degradation. Although alkaptonuria can present with brown-blue discoloration of the ear cartilage, it does not usually present with buccal hyperpigmentation.
E. Late-night salivary cortisol – Incorrect. Late-night salivary cortisol, performed close to midnight, is an initial test for hypercortisolism or Cushing syndrome. Physiologic cortisol levels nadir near midnight; therefore, high cortisol levels indicate pathologic hypercortisolism.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^c9ac5173]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Several human studies have examined whether there is a daily variation in the cortisol response to acute exposure to experimental stressors, such as physical exercise and psychosocial stressors. The most common hypothesis motivating these studies was that the stress response would be lower in the morning, when basal activity is high, than in the evening and early part of the night, when basal activity is low. Pharmacological studies investigating the impact of time of day on the pituitary-adrenal axis response to CRH stimulation have generally found that the cortisol response is indeed higher in the afternoon or evening than in the morning, whereas the ACTH response is similar at both times of day. The findings are consistent with the existence of a rhythm of adrenal sensitivity to GC stimulation where sensitivity is higher in the evening, as demonstrated in several studies of timed exogenous ACTH administration. When low to moderate intensity physical exercise was used as a stressor, the findings regarding an impact of time of day have been mostly negative, despite the fact that physical performance is typically better in the afternoon and early evening than in the morning. However, in studies of high-intensity exercise, the impact on cortisol levels was clearly highest in the evening. It is thus possible that the impact of exercise on GC release is dependent on both the psychological effort and metabolic demands of the physical activity. The HPA response to a psychological stressor has been best studied using the TSST, a widely used standardized laboratory stress protocol that induces a cortisol elevation in a majority of research participants. The results of an analysis of 180 adults who were submitted to the TSST between 9:45and 7did not detect significant time of day variations in the response of free salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol, or plasma ACTH. In summary, whereas increasing numbers of individuals are involved in voluntary physical exercise in the evening or exposed to psychological stress associated with fast paced video games, it remains unclear whether these activities are consistently associated with increased GC secretion at the time of the habitual nadir, with potential adverse effects on the synchronization of central and peripheral circadian clocks.

### Should patients with phosphomannomutase 2-CDG (PMM2-CDG) be screened for adrenal insufficiency? [^675a0ab4]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

PMM2-CDG is the most common congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) accounting for almost 65% of known CDG cases affecting N-glycosylation. Abnormalities in N-glycosylation could have a negative impact on many endocrine axes. There is very little known on the effect of impaired N-glycosylation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and whether CDG patients are at risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency and decreased adrenal cortisol production. Cortisol and ACTH concentrations were simultaneously measured between 7:44 am to 1 pm in forty-three subjects (20 female, median age 12.8 years, range 0.1 to 48.6 years) participating in an ongoing international, multi-center Natural History study for PMM2-CDG (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03173300). Of the 43 subjects, 11 (25.6%) had cortisol below 5 μg/dl and low to normal ACTH levels, suggestive of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Two of the 11 subjects have confirmed central adrenal insufficiency and are on hydrocortisone replacement and/or stress dosing during illness; 3 had normal and 1 had subnormal cortisol response to ACTH low-dose stimulation test but has not yet been started on therapy; the remaining 5 have upcoming stimulation testing planned. Our findings suggest that patients with PMM2-CDG may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of morning cortisol and ACTH levels should be part of the standard care in patients with PMM2-CDG.
