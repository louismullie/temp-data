## Question

patient with blood sugar of 520. next steps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next steps for a patient with a blood sugar of 520 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether this represents a hyperglycemic crisis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup to distinguish DKA from HHS and identify precipitating causes. Next, I will outline fluid, insulin, and electrolyte management, followed by monitoring and transition planning. Finally, I need to consider special populations and outpatient follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the severity and urgency. A glucose of 520 mg/dL is profoundly elevated and meets criteria for hyperglycemic crisis; I need to check for DKA versus HHS and assess mental status, hemodynamics, and volume status immediately, because both entities carry high morbidity and mandate emergent care with IV fluids, insulin, and electrolytes, along with a search for precipitating causes [^113iRuC9] [^1117ZCKL].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework before jumping to treatment. I should obtain stat labs including basic metabolic panel, serum glucose, bicarbonate, anion gap, beta-hydroxybutyrate or serum ketones, and calculate effective serum osmolality; I also need to check for precipitating illness such as infection, myocardial ischemia, or medication nonadherence, because identifying and treating the trigger is essential to resolution and relapse prevention [^113iRuC9] [^114LxCFu].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between DKA and HHS. DKA typically presents with glucose > 250 mg/dL, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia, whereas HHS features glucose > 600 mg/dL, marked hyperosmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, and minimal ketosis; given 520 mg/dL, HHS is less likely but still possible if osmolality is high and ketones are low, so I need to ensure I do not miss a mixed picture or euglycemic DKA, which can occur with normal or mildly elevated glucose in the presence of ketosis and acidosis [^113iRuC9] [^1163TwTf].

> I will now examine fluid resuscitation, since volume depletion is universal in HHS and common in DKA. Isotonic saline should be started immediately, with typical initial boluses of 1–2 liters in adults, followed by continuous infusion to replace the estimated 8–12 liter deficit in HHS and the substantial deficit in DKA; I should double-check for heart failure or renal failure to individualize the rate and consider switching to 0.45% saline if sodium rises excessively, while remembering that overly aggressive fluids can rarely precipitate cerebral edema, so I need to monitor neurologic status closely [^113iRuC9] [^114LxCFu].

> Next, I should review insulin therapy. Continuous IV insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hour is standard for DKA and HHS, with an initial bolus of 0.1 units/kg if DKA is confirmed; I need to ensure dextrose is added and insulin continued once glucose falls below 250 mg/dL in DKA because ketosis resolves more slowly than hyperglycemia, and I should plan to transition to subcutaneous basal insulin 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^113iRuC9] [^1163TwTf].

> Let me consider electrolytes, especially potassium, because insulin shifts potassium intracellularly and total body potassium is often depleted despite normal or high serum levels. I should replace potassium aggressively once urine output is established, typically 10–20 mEq/hour, and adjust based on frequent checks; I also need to monitor for hypokalemia-related arrhythmias and be prepared to treat other electrolyte disturbances such as phosphate or magnesium as indicated [^113iRuC9] [^114LxCFu].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence. Frequent point-of-care glucose every 1–2 hours initially, electrolytes and anion gap every 4–6 hours, and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring are essential; I need to watch for declining mental status suggesting cerebral edema or other complications, and I should document resolution of DKA with closure of the anion gap and clearance of ketones rather than normalization of glucose alone [^113iRuC9] [^1163TwTf].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, a child, or has special circumstances. In pregnancy, maternal hyperglycemia increases risks for adverse outcomes, so I should involve obstetrics early and use insulin-based protocols with tight but safe targets; in pediatrics, cerebral edema risk is higher, so fluids and insulin must be carefully titrated; in older adults, I should balance aggressive correction with the risk of fluid overload and neurologic compromise, and I should remember that euglycemic DKA can occur with SGLT2 inhibitors, prompting ketone assessment even when glucose is not extremely high [^113iRuC9] [^1163TwTf].

> Next, I should review transition and disposition planning. Once DKA resolves or HHS stabilizes, I will switch to a basal-bolus subcutaneous regimen and continue IV insulin until 2–4 hours after the first subcutaneous dose; I need to ensure diabetes education, sick-day rules, and follow-up are arranged, and I should consider that short-term intensive insulin in new-onset type 2 diabetes can improve beta-cell function, though this requires structured follow-up and lifestyle support to sustain remission [^1163TwTf] [^111uEuPv].

> Hold on, I should verify outpatient medication decisions. If this is new-onset type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia, starting insulin and then layering metformin once euvolemic and renal function allows is reasonable; if this is established type 2 diabetes with an acute decompensation, I should reassess the home regimen, address adherence, and often continue insulin at discharge with a plan to de-escalate as glucotoxicity resolves, aligning with AACE and ADA guidance for symptomatic hyperglycemia and A1C > 10% or glucose > 300 mg/dL [^116t4cvs] [^115TcJLY].

> I need to ensure I have not overlooked hypoglycemia risk during and after treatment. Severe hyperglycemia can mask hypoglycemia unawareness, and rapid shifts with insulin can precipitate low glucose, so I should educate the patient on recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia and arrange close follow-up, especially if insulin is continued at discharge [^111iF3rR].

> In summary, I should act decisively: stabilize ABCs, confirm DKA versus HHS with labs, start isotonic fluids, initiate IV insulin with appropriate bolus and infusion, replace potassium proactively, monitor closely, treat the precipitating cause, and plan a safe transition with subcutaneous insulin and structured follow-up; this sequence reduces morbidity and recurrence risk and is consistent with contemporary consensus and review guidance [^113iRuC9] [^1117ZCKL].

For a blood sugar of 520 mg/dL, **immediate action is required** to prevent hyperglycemic crisis. Confirm the reading with a lab glucose, check for DKA/HHS [^113iRuC9] (serum ketones, bicarbonate, anion gap, osmolality), and start IV fluids (normal saline) [^113iRuC9] and an insulin infusion [^1163TwTf] if DKA/HHS is present. If the patient is stable and there is no crisis, initiate basal insulin [^116t4cvs] and aggressive hydration, and address the cause (e.g. infection, nonadherence). Monitor glucose and electrolytes closely, and arrange endocrine follow-up [^114h1Hf3].

---

## Immediate assessment and stabilization

- **Confirm hyperglycemia**: Repeat glucose with a laboratory venous sample to verify the capillary reading [^113Rmpb9].

- **Assess clinical status**: Evaluate mental status, hydration, vitals, and signs of DKA/HHS (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered mentation, dehydration) [^114Vw7x6].

- **Check for hyperglycemic crisis**: Obtain serum ketones, bicarbonate, anion gap, and calculate osmolality to distinguish DKA from HHS [^113iRuC9].

- **Identify precipitating factors**: Look for infection, myocardial ischemia, pancreatitis, medication nonadherence, or new medications (e.g. corticosteroids, SGLT2 inhibitors) [^114LxCFu].

---

## Management of hyperglycemic crisis (DKA/HHS)

If DKA or HHS is present, **admit to ICU or step-down unit** and begin the following:

| **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Fluid resuscitation | Start normal saline (1–2 L bolus, then 15–20 mL/kg/h) [^notfound]; switch to dextrose-containing fluids when glucose < 250 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketosis resolves [^113aX4rv] |
| Insulin therapy | Begin IV insulin infusion at 0.1 units/kg/h [^notfound]; if DKA, give 0.1 units/kg IV bolus if no insulin in the prior 4 hours [^notfound] |
| Electrolyte management | Replace potassium aggressively once urine output is established; add other electrolytes as needed [^113iRuC9] |
| Monitoring | Check glucose every 1–2 hours, electrolytes and acid-base status every 4–6 hours [^notfound] |
| Transition | Switch to subcutaneous insulin 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^1163TwTf] |

---

## Management of stable, non-crisis hyperglycemia

If the patient is stable and there is **no DKA/HHS**, proceed as follows:

- **Hydration**: Give IV normal saline (1–2 L bolus, then 100–200 mL/h) if dehydrated; otherwise encourage oral hydration.

- **Insulin initiation**: Start basal insulin (e.g. glargine 0.2 units/kg/day) [^116t4cvs] and titrate to fasting glucose 100–180 mg/dL [^115Wn4FD].

- **Oral agents**: Add metformin if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min and no contraindications; consider GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor if indicated [^112sobXc].

- **Monitoring**: Check glucose every 4–6 hours initially, then adjust frequency as stable.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Continuous monitoring**: Track glucose, electrolytes, and renal function closely during correction.

- **Education**: Provide diabetes self-management education, sick-day rules, and hypoglycemia training [^111iF3rR].

- **Follow-up**: Arrange endocrinology or primary care within 1–2 weeks; consider CGM for intensive management [^116aKDQQ].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated severe hyperglycemia can lead to **DKA/HHS** [^113iRuC9], **electrolyte disturbances**, acute kidney injury, cerebral edema, thrombosis, and increased infection risk, with substantial morbidity and mortality [^114LxCFu].

---

## Summary of key steps

- **Confirm glucose and assess for crisis** [^113Rmpb9] [^113iRuC9].
- **Start fluids and insulin if DKA/HHS** [^113iRuC9] [^1163TwTf].
- **Initiate basal insulin and hydration if stable** [^116t4cvs] [^115Wn4FD].
- **Monitor closely and address the cause** [^113iRuC9].
- **Arrange follow-up and education** [^111iF3rR].

A glucose of 520 mg/dL is a **medical emergency**; prompt recognition, fluids, insulin, and close monitoring are essential to prevent complications and guide safe transition to outpatient care.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^115TYDYN]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes affects 25.8 million people (8.3%) in the USA. There were 1.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2010 alone. While the diagnostic threshold for diabetes is an A1C ≥ 6.5%, patients can present with severe hyperglycemia with A1C values reaching higher than 14%. Severe hyperglycemia may warrant specific and immediate treatment considerations to prevent acute complications, alleviate symptoms, and preserve beta cell function. However, literature regarding the effectiveness of different treatment approaches to manage patients with non-emergent, severe hyperglycemia is limited.

The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) position statement on a patient-centered approach to the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes recommends that "if a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (> 300–350 mg/dL), or an A1C ≥ 10–12%, insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset". After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels are decreased, oral agents can be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred. This recommendation makes no distinction between newly diagnosed or drug-naïve patients and treated or established patients, and does not provide references or level of evidence.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) algorithm for glycemic control recommends insulin therapy ± other agents for patients who present with an A1C > 9%. The recommendations state that "for drug naïve patients with A1C levels > 9%, it is unlikely that 1, 2, or even 3 agents (other than insulin) will achieve the A1C goal". The algorithm does, however, suggest that treatment with combination non-insulin agents in drug-naïve patients who do not have symptoms may be sufficient. References or levels of evidence are not provided.

Although consensus statements suggest initiating insulin therapy, this is challenging in real-world practice. Successful insulin initiation requires time, resources, knowledge, proper dose titration, significant patient education and training, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and frequent follow-up. In the primary care setting, many barriers exist, including time restraints, patient resistance, and lack of available resources and trained staff that make it difficult to initiate insulin therapy in a safe and effective manner.

### Assessing inpatient glycemic control: what are the next steps? [^111AmV6b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the emergence of glucometrics (i.e., systematic analysis of data on blood glucose levels of inpatients) as a subject of high interest, there remains a lack of standardization on how glucose parameters are measured and reported. This dilemma must be resolved before a national benchmarking process can be developed that will allow institutions to track and compare inpatient glucose control performance against established guidelines and that can also be supported by quality care organizations. In this article, we review some of the questions that need to be resolved through consensus and review of the evidence, and discuss some of the limitations in analyzing and reporting inpatient glucose data that must be addressed (or at least accepted as limitations) before hospitals can commit resources to gathering, compiling, and presenting inpatient glucose statistics as a health care quality measure. Standards must include consensus on which measures to report, the unit of analysis, definitions of targets for hyperglycemia treatment, a definition of hypoglycemia, determination of how data should be gathered (from chart review or from laboratory information systems), and which type of sample (blood or point of care) should be used for analysis of glycemic control. Hospitals and/or their representatives should be included in the discussion. For inpatient glucose control to remain a focus of interest, further dialogue and consensus on the topic are needed.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112ZsfQn]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standard definitions of glucose abnormalities — In hospitalized individuals, hyperglycemia is defined as blood glucose levels > 140 mg/dL (> 7.8 mmol/L). Level 1 hypoglycemia is defined as a glucose concentration of 54–69 mg/dL (3.0–3.8 mmol/L), level 2 hypoglycemia is defined as a glucose concentration < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L), and level 3 hypoglycemia is defined as a clinical event requiring assistance; levels 2 and 3 require immediate intervention, and prompt treatment of level 1 hypoglycemia is recommended to prevent progression.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

Hypoglycemia definitions and levels — diabetes mellitus: Hypoglycemia may be asymptomatic, and any BG < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is generally considered hypoglycemia. In persons with DM, hypoglycemia is separated into 3 levels: Level 1 is a measurable glucose < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), but ≥ 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L); Level 2 is a measurable glucose < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) that needs immediate action; Level 3 is defined as a severe event characterized by altered mental status and/or physical status requiring assistance.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114Vw7x6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Hyperglycemic crisis recognition and sick day/home management — clinical directives include: hyperglycemic crisis should be considered in all individuals presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomiting, dehydration, and change in cognitive state; individuals at risk for DKA should be counseled on early signs and symptoms, provided urine and/or blood ketone tests, and educated on timely self-management; individuals treated with intensive insulin therapy should not stop or hold their basal insulin even if not eating; those with mild ketosis and potential precipitating factors, particularly if glucose levels exceed 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), may be managed at home, and when hemodynamically and cognitively intact may treat mild DKA with frequent glucose and ketone monitoring, noncaloric hydration, and subcutaneous insulin; individuals should seek immediate medical attention if unable to hydrate orally, if glucose does not improve with insulin, with altered mental status, or signs of worsening illness; because HHS is associated with greater volume depletion and typically triggered by acute illness, suspected HHS should be immediately evaluated and treated in the inpatient setting.

### Emergency department management of uncomplicated hyperglycemia in patients without history of diabetes [^1134LKFW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Recommendations addressing uncomplicated hyperglycemia in the ED are limited, and the management of those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes presents a challenge.

Objective

This narrative review will discuss the ED evaluation and management of hyperglycemic adult patients without a history of diabetes who do not have evidence of a hyperglycemic crisis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Discussion

Many adults who present to the ED have risk factors for diabetes and meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diabetes screening. A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can be established in the ED by the ADA criteria in patients with a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with an elevation in random blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Treatment may begin in the ED and varies depending on the presenting severity of hyperglycemia. Treatment options include metformin, long-acting insulin, or deferring for close outpatient management.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes is important to prevent long-term complications.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116t4cvs]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 symptomatic hyperglycemia — initial insulin indications: Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111KTQkh]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia should be treated and provides a reasonable target range for hyperglycemia treatment. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose: one STeP forward? [^116MUnHs]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In times of short health care budgets, reimbursement for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in diabetes patients without insulin treatment is subject to debate. The Structured Testing Program (STeP) trial found a positive correlation of test frequency and improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients not treated with insulin.

Methods

A structured literature search for other clinical studies reporting on SMBG frequency was performed.

Results

There is scarce evidence: three trials, including STeP, noted a significant and relevant correlation between testing frequency and improved HbA1c levels (FA effect), whereas two studies did not. The comparability between the identified studies is problematic.

Conclusion

Future research should consider correlations between testing frequency and level of glycemic control. More emphasis should be placed on a structured approach to use SMBG and to address adherence to testing and therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113HavEv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of hypoglycemia, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer glucose as the preferred treatment of conscious patients with glucose < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L), although any form of glucose-containing carbohydrate may be used. Avoid using foods or beverages high in fat and/or protein for initial treatment of hypoglycemia. Repeat the treatment if hypoglycemia persists 15 minutes after initial administration.

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

We do not recommend postponing ambulatory procedure based on A1C levels. We recommend proceeding with the planned procedure in patients presenting with hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL, 10 mmol/L) in the absence of DKA or HHNS. We recommend target blood glucose concentrations of 180–250 mg/dL, based on patient and procedure characteristics. We recommend preoperative hydration with water in lieu of carbohydrate loading in diabetes patients. We recommend the use of subcutaneous insulin administration for treatment of hyperglycemia. We recommend the use of point-of-care glucose meters to confirm accuracy of continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin dosing systems in perioperative blood glucose management. We suggest continuing a patient's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for procedures under 2 h if the device can be placed outside of the surgical field and can be easily visualized and accessed. We suggest that significant perioperative hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentrations > 250 mg/dL) in insulin naive patients may be treated with insulin based on patient and procedure characteristics. We recommend the use of low-dose (4 mg) dexamethasone in patients with diabetes. We recommend each facility develop and implement a blood glucose management protocol.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^111ek5VT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^117731s8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) have published algorithms for management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. According to these algorithms, the first step of diabetes treatment should consist of lifestyle intervention plus metformin. If optimal glycemic control is not achieved, step two consists of addition of either a sulphonylurea or basal insulin. These recommendations have not, however, been tested in real-life settings. In Brazil, most patients with type 2 diabetes are treated at primary care clinics and have access to metformin, sulfonylureas, and NPH insulin, which are provided free of charge by the public health care system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze whether an HbA 1c level of < 7.0% can be achieved and maintained in patients with type 2 diabetes treated at a primary care clinic in accordance with ADA/EASD guidelines.

Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^113nPBoN]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes care in specific settings:

The "Diabetes care in the hospital" section has been significantly revised, and recommendations for glucose goals have been revised. Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible, and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in some but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C)
The "Diabetes care in the school and day care setting" section has been revised, including the recommendations. An individualized Diabetes Medical Management Plan (DMMP) should be developed by the parent/guardian and the student's personal diabetes health care team with input from the parent/guardian. (E) All school staff members who have responsibility for a student with diabetes should receive training that provides a basic understanding of diabetes and a student's needs. (E) While the school nurse is the coordinator and primary provider of diabetes care, a small number of school personnel should be trained in routine and emergency diabetes procedures (including monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of insulin and glucagon) and in the appropriate response to high and low blood glucose levels and should perform these diabetes care tasks when the school nurse is not available to do so. These school personnel need not be health care professionals. (E) As specified in the DMMP and as developmentally appropriate, the student with diabetes should have immediate access to diabetes supplies at all times and should be permitted to self-manage his or her diabetes in the classroom or anywhere the student may be in conjunction with a school activity. Such self-management should include blood glucose monitoring and responding to blood glucose levels with needed food and medication. (E)
The "Hypoglycemia and employment/licensure" section has been renamed "Diabetes and employment" and contains new recommendations. When questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes for a particular job, a health care professional with expertise in treating diabetes should perform an individualized assessment; input from the treating physician should always be included. (E) Proper safety assessments for employment should include review of blood glucose test results, history of severe hypoglycemia, presence of hypoglycemia unawareness, and presence of diabetes-related complications but should not include urine glucose or A1C/eAG (estimated average glucose) tests or be based on a general assessment of level of control.

Challenges Associated with Care of Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes

The timely diagnosis of T2D remains a challenge, since the condition does not present with clear symptoms for a significant period of time once hyperglycemia may be detectable. Consequently, people with new-onset T2D, or those at risk, do not actively seek medical help. It is for this reason that identifying people at risk and undertaking regular screening is essential for making an effective diagnosis of prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycemia or T2D, as well as enabling early initiation of pharmacological and behavioral therapy. Effective treatment from the moment of diagnosis and early intensification of therapy when treatment goals are not being met are key to preventing and delaying the development of the vascular complications of diabetes.

The largest group of people with T2D are those of advancing years with numerous comorbidities, in whom the benefits of lowering blood glucose levels must be weighed against the risk of hypoglycemia. Frequent overlap between multiple disease processes and the drugs employed in treating them renders glycemic control, in this patient group, a therapeutic challenge.

People with T2D have up to a 10% greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a 53% higher risk of myocardial infarction, a 58% higher risk of stroke, and a 12% higher risk of heart failure when compared with people without diabetes. Numerous studies confirm that the risk of CVD is increased by a factor of 1.6–2.3 in people with T2D, compared to those without. Some of this risk is attributed to the impact of hypoglycemia on processes that are implicated in development of CVD. Studies in healthy individuals and in those with diabetes, particularly T1D, indicate that acute hypoglycemia leads to increased proinflammatory cytokines, mobilization of inflammatory leukocytes, and increased platelet reactivity. Moreover, repeated hypoglycemia in T2D is also associated with enhanced coagulation, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation, which are each associated with CVD.

As compared with genuine tight glucose control, Safe, Effective Glucose Control - already used in many intensive care units worldwide - is intended to decrease the rate of hypoglycemia and the workload, while reducing the adverse effects of severe hyperglycemia.

### Intense simplified strategy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in patients with severe hyperglycaemia: multicentre, open label, randomised trial [^111uEuPv]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As estimated by the International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalence of diabetes has reached 537 million. Exposure to hyperglycaemia, even in the first year after diagnosis, is a primary risk factor for chronic complications of diabetes and even death. These effects can persist for decades and are known as the legacy effect. As discovered recently by the 24 year follow-up of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, early intensive glycaemic control provides a near lifelong reduction in the risk of death and of microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, despite various glucose lowering treatments, more than half of the patients had inadequate glycaemic control, indicating that traditional treatment strategies that escalate treatment intensity in a stepwise manner to overcome deteriorating hyperglycaemia are unable to delay β cell failure and progression of diabetes.

Significant hyperglycaemia is common in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Owing to the limited efficacy of monotherapy, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend that combination therapy should be used when the glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels exceed treatment targets by 1.5% (≥ 8.5% for most patients), with insulin therapy needed if HbA 1c exceeds 10% (evidence level E; expert consensus or clinical experience). Nevertheless, standardised treatment pathways for these patients remain unclear.

Emerging evidence has shown that the progression of type 2 diabetes is not irreversible, especially in the early stages. Short term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) has shown immediate and substantial benefits in early type 2 diabetes. Two to three weeks of SIIT significantly improves β cell function and insulin sensitivity by eliminating glucotoxicity, inducing remission of diabetes for longer than a year in more than 50% of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. In most studies of SIIT, benefits were observed in patients with significant hyperglycaemia (mean HbA 1c ≥ 10%) and mild overweight (mean body mass index approximately 25). Nevertheless, the remission rate declined over time, from 70% immediately after SIIT to roughly 50% at the end of the first year and around 40% at the end of the second year. This provides a rationale for investigating whether simplified oral regimens subsequent to SIIT could help to maintain the good glycaemic control induced by SIIT by persistently avoiding the detrimental effects of glucotoxicity and circumventing the disadvantages of intricate glucose lowering regimens.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114qe4sd]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

Strict control may be considered in select patients because maintaining postoperative blood glucose less than 139 mg/dL has been shown to lower surgical site infection rate by 35% in women with diabetes mellitus and postoperative hyperglycemia; levels above this range should be managed with insulin and regular blood glucose monitoring. There are various protocols to achieve glycemic control, but data are too limited to recommend one specific protocol over another.

Routine self-management of blood glucose levels is strongly recommended to guide appropriate, safe, and timely medication de-escalation, if relevant, and a plan for medication de-escalation should include protocols for (a) identifying medication(s) that may negatively impact the success of lifestyle intervention and (b) educating patients to identify and report symptoms and/or self-monitoring values that alert a need for medication de-escalation(s).

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

Module A: T2DM management — The algorithm begins with a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and first asks whether there is an urgent or emergent care need (e.g., symptomatic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, concurrent medical issue); if yes, treat and/or refer for acute care, and if no, assess barriers to success (e.g., psychosocial needs, navigating health care, health literacy/numeracy, patient/provider inertia, social determinants of health [e.g., transportation, economic or food insecurity]). The next step is to develop an individualized treatment plan reviewing non‑pharmacologic therapies (Medical Nutrition Therapy including weight management; Diabetes Self‑Management Education and Support; exercise), and if pharmacologic therapy is indicated, begin metformin unless contraindicated. The algorithm then evaluates whether the patient has any of the following: established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk, diabetic neuropathy, or heart failure; if yes, consider GLP‑1 RA or SGLT‑2 inhibitor if indicated, and if no, assess whether the glycemic target has been achieved (A1C 7.0–8.5% for most patients or alternative range based on individualization). If the target has not been achieved, consider additional medications until the target A1C range is achieved and select the agent based on efficacy and risk‑benefit ration; if the target has been achieved, review the treatment plan to minimize or treat complications and/or comorbidities.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) contribute significantly to the estimated US$174 billion annual cost of diabetes mellitus. Of the $116 billion in medical expenditures attributed to diabetes, approximately 50% ($58 billion) are inpatient costs.DKA and HHS are managed initially by hospital emergency departments (EDs), followed by inpatient medical care. A typical ED visit involves at least a 4-hour wait time, is inconvenient, and the average costs for a visit without admission are estimated at ≥ $1000. Wait time in the ED has increased in the last decade due to an increasing number of patients using the ED at the same time that more EDs are closing their doors.

Nationally recognized management protocols only exist for hospital settings. These protocols exist as initial treatment after the DKA or HHS diagnosis has been established. There is evidence to suggest type 1 diabetes patients with mild DKA can be managed with rapid-acting insulin analogs in an outpatient setting.–It is currently unknown if symptomatic, mild hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients can be managed adequately in an outpatient setting. Most diabetes education centers have policies and procedures to contact physicians when a patient presents with high blood glucose (BG) levels. However, no established outpatient hyperglycemia protocol exists. The literature does describe common causes of acute metabolic decompensation: acute illness (ie, infection, myocardial infection), noncompliance with treatment, and new-onset diabetes. Significant contributing factors within the noncompliance group are omission of insulin therapy and substance abuse (especially alcohol and cocaine). Even using the costs in 1998, national estimates for hospitalization for diabetic emergencies are high at $10,876, with an average length of stay of 6.6 days.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^111xGoif]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^113iRuC9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### Hyperglycemia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: key clinical challenges and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^111RjbrZ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

While oncologists inevitably must play an invaluable role in the detection and early assessment of ICI-related hyperglycemia, ongoing management should be shared with the patient's primary care physician and, where appropriate, an endocrinologist. We recommend early communication and shared care with a primary care physician for management for all patients with hyperglycemia, with referral to endocrinology where insulin is expected to be required. In high-risk patients, and those who are already on an sodium glucose co-transport 2 inhibitor (SGLT2 inhibitor), re-education about the risk of DKA, and particularly euglycemic DKA, should be provided. Patients should have the capability to measure ketones as well as self-monitoring blood glucose. If this is not feasible, consider whether SGLT2 inhibitors could be ceased.

After initial screening and investigations are conducted as per figure 1, once hyperglycemia is identified, we recommend using the algorithm in figure 2 to determine underlying etiology and referring to the relevant section below for further management guidance.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes mellitus — management and monitoring emphasize inpatient standard-of-care treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin, avoidance of glucocorticoids for this condition, and routine glycemic surveillance. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated as inpatients with fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion, and high-dose glucocorticoids are not recommended because they do not reverse the course and may worsen glycemic control. Baseline testing of fasting or random plasma glucose and HbA1c is recommended prior to immune checkpoint inhibitor initiation, with plasma glucose monitored at each administration and HbA1c checked if hyperglycemia is detected. Clinical practice points note that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can precipitate fulminant insulin deficiency with severe hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, can significantly worsen glycemic control in those with pre‑existing diabetes requiring additional oral or insulin therapy, and that there is no role for glucocorticoids in the management of immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes. Insulin therapy is described as irreversible in the vast majority of such cases, and C‑peptide testing during the acute presentation does not change immediate management but may assist during follow‑up to differentiate from other causes of ketosis‑prone diabetes.

QUESTION 7: WHAT ARE THE OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR TRANSITION TO OUTPATIENT CARE?

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting is an important goal of inpatient diabetes management and begins with the hospital admission. This entails a fundamental shift in responsibility from a situation in which hospital personnel provide the diabetes care to one in which the patient is capable of self-management. Successful coordination of this transition requires a team approach that may involve physicians, nurses, medical assistants, dietitians, case managers, and social workers. Hospitals with certified diabetes educators benefit from their expertise during the discharge process.

Admission assessment obtains information regarding any prior history of diabetes or hyperglycemia, its management, and the level of glycemic control. Early assessment of a patient's cognitive abilities, literacy level, visual acuity, dexterity, cultural context, and financial resources for acquiring outpatient diabetic supplies allows sufficient time to prepare the patient and address problem areas.

Hospitalization provides a unique opportunity for addressing a patient's education in diabetes self-management. Because the mean hospital LOS is usually < 5 days and the capacity to learn new material may be limited during acute illness, diabetes-related education is frequently limited to an inventory of basic "survival skills".

It is recommended that the following areas be reviewed and addressed before the patient is discharged from the hospital:
Level of understanding related to the diagnosis of diabetes
Self-monitoring of BG and explanation of home BG goals
Definition, recognition, treatment, and prevention of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
Identification of health care provider who will be responsible for diabetes care after discharge
Information on consistent eating patterns
When and how to take BG-lowering medications, including administration of insulin (if the patient is receiving insulin for ongoing management at home)
Sick day management
Proper use and disposal of needles and syringes

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^114LxCFu]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose, hyperosmolarity, and little or no ketosis. With the dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the aging population, this condition may be encountered more frequently by family physicians in the future. Although the precipitating causes are numerous, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, non-compliance, undiagnosed diabetes, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. Physical findings of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state include those associated with profound dehydration and various neurologic symptoms such as coma. The first step of treatment involves careful monitoring of the patient and laboratory values. Vigorous correction of dehydration with the use of normal saline is critical, requiring an average of 9 L in 48 hours. After urine output has been established, potassium replacement should begin. Once fluid replacement has been initiated, insulin should be given as an initial bolus of 0.15 U per kg intravenously, followed by a drip of 0.1 U per kg per hour until the blood glucose level falls to between 250 and 300 mg per dL. Identification and treatment of the underlying and precipitating causes are necessary. It is important to monitor the patient for complications such as vascular occlusions (e.g., mesenteric artery occlusion, myocardial infarction, low-flow syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) and rhabdomyolysis. Finally, physicians should focus on preventing future episodes using patient education and instruction in self-monitoring.

### Hyperglycemia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: key clinical challenges and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^113HLQFi]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have an expanding role in the management of numerous cancers. Hyperglycaemia is commonly seen in patients treated with ICIs. However, the differential diagnosis for hyperglycaemia is broad, and incorrect diagnosis can have serious consequences. Herein we review the available literature on causes of hyperglycaemia in ICI treated patients and expert guidelines on management and provide an updated synthesis of expert multidisciplinary recommendations. Our key recommendations are as follows: Intensity of screening for hyperglycaemia should be based on a patient's risk level, including assessment of factors such as corticosteroid use, pre-existing diabetes, baseline HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels (BGL). People with new onset hyperglycaemia should undergo initial assessment to determine severity and aetiology, including bedside capillary BGL, and formal bloods including lipase, C-peptide with matching glucose, electrolytes and renal function and in some cases type 1 diabetes autoantibodies. People with BGL > 15mmol/L (or those receiving SGLT2 inhibitors with BGL > 10mmol/L) should additionally have ketones measured. Patients with a high risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (BGL > 15 mmol/L, ketones > 2 mmol/L) and/or risk of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (BGL persistently > 20 mmol/L or reading 'HI') should be referred directly to hospital for emergency assessment and management. Further management of hyperglycaemia should be tailored to the underlying cause(s).

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114GBMWj]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The levels of plasma or capillary glucose (most meters that measure fingerstick capillary samples are adjusted to provide values equivalent to plasma glucose) that should result in long-term glycemia in the nondiabetic target range, as measured by A1C, are fasting and preprandial levels between 3.9 and 7.2 mmol/l (70 and 130 mg/dl). If A1C levels remain above the desired target despite preprandial levels that are in range, postprandial levels, usually measured 90–120 min after a meal, may be checked. They should be < 10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) to achieve A1C levels in the target range.

Attempts to achieve target glycemic levels with regimens including sulfonylureas or insulin may be associated with modest hypoglycemia, with glucose levels in the 3.1–3.9 mmol/l (55–70 mg/dl) range. These episodes are generally well tolerated, easily treated with oral carbohydrate such as glucose tablets or 120–180 mL (4–6 oz) of juice or nondiet soda, and rarely progress to more severe hypoglycemia, including loss of consciousness or seizures.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^111S5dje]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

DKA

DKA (see ref.for definition) is an acute complication of diabetes that can be associated with new-onset type 1 diabetes, insulin omission, and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones/cytokines associated with stress, such as an infection. Mild cases can be safely and effectively treated in an acute care setting with appropriate resources and may not require hospitalization. Education must be provided to individuals with type 1 diabetes in order to help prevent DKA, which can have serious sequelae, particularly in children under 5 years of age. Although DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) may overlap, especially when dehydration is severe, DKA must be distinguished from HHS (serum glucose > 600 mg/dL, serum osmolality > 330 mOsm/kg, and no significant ketosis and acidosis) because patients with HHS typically are severely dehydrated and require more aggressive fluid management. There are multiple guidelines available for the management of DKA.

Recommendations

Individuals and caregivers of individuals with type 1 diabetes should be educated and reminded annually how to prevent DKA, including a review of sick-day rules and the critical importance of always administering insulin and monitoring both glucose and ketone levels. (B)
Insulin omission is the major cause of DKA; therefore, individuals with type 1 diabetes must have access to an uninterrupted supply of insulin. (E)
Patients with type 1 diabetes and their families should have around-the-clock access to medical advice and support to assist with sick-day management. (C)
Standard protocols for DKA treatment should be available in emergency departments and hospitals. (E)

Step 4: Consensus Recommendations on the Management of Each Risk Factor

Metabolic Control

Glycosylated Hemoglobin

Given the asymptomatic nature of diabetes, patients remain with high HbA1c values for years without treatment intensification, increasing the risk of microvascular complications. The DISCOVER study found that in Latin America, 80% of patients had an average HbA1c of 8.5% (vs. 7%, suggested by the treatment guidelines). The study highlighted the clinical inertia in treatment intensification and the need for intensive risk factor screening to improve the prognosis of these patients from the Latin American region. Additionally, it is mandatory to acknowledge strategies between physicians and patients to improve adherence and lifestyle changes. It is a process of communication and commitment.

Some recommendations to avoid clinical inertia are:
Do not delay therapeutic escalation while awaiting adherence to lifestyle changes. Evidence-based clinical practice recommendations should be followed.
Adapt a language that is appropriate to each patient.
Agree on therapeutic goals with the patient; emphasize the importance of treatment adherence and the risk of poor metabolic control with the patient and seek his/her commitment.
Discuss the asymptomatic nature of the disease and the need for periodic control with the patient.
Discuss with the patient the progressive nature of the disease and the need to check blood sugar regularly despite being on treatment.
Design a written follow-up agenda and set reminders.

The ESC guideline recommends structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and/or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to facilitate optimal glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring (real-time or intermittent) helps overcome many limitations associated with the traditional HbA1c testing and SMBG by providing uniform tracks of the glucose concentration, thus reflecting intra- and inter-day glycemic excursions. The international consensus recommends using CGM in conjunction with HbA1c in all patients with diabetes who are not achieving glycemic targets despite insulin therapy. Furthermore, it also emphasizes patient education and training for interpreting glucose data and improving treatment adherence.

GLUCOSE

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: WHEN GLUCOSE IS USED TO ESTABLISH THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, IT SHOULD BE MEASURED IN VENOUS PLASMA A (high).

RECOMMENDATION: WHEN GLUCOSE IS USED FOR SCREENING OF HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS, IT SHOULD BE MEASURED IN VENOUS PLASMA B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: PLASMA GLUCOSE SHOULD BE MEASURED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY WHEN USED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF OR SCREENING FOR DIABETES Good Practice Point (GPP).

RECOMMENDATION: OUTCOME STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING C (moderate).

A. Diagnosis/screening.

The diagnosis of diabetes is established by identifying the presence of hyperglycemia. For many years the only method recommended for diagnosis was a direct demonstration of hyperglycemia by measuring increased glucose concentrations in the plasma. In 1979, a set of criteria based on the distribution of glucose concentrations in high-risk populations was established to standardize the diagnosis. These recommendations were endorsed by the WHO. In 1997, the diagnostic criteria were modified to better identify individuals at risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. The revised criteria comprised: 1) an FPG value ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); 2) a 2-h postload glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during an OGTT; or 3) symptoms of diabetes and a casual (i.e. regardless of the time of the preceding meal) plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) (Table 4). If any one of these three criteria is met, confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day is necessary to establish the diagnosis [note that repeat testing is not required for patients who have unequivocal hyperglycemia, i.e. > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hyperglycemia]. The WHO and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommend either an FPG test or a 2-h postload glucose test that uses the same cutoffs as the ADA (Table 5). In 2009, the International Expert Committee, which comprised members appointed by the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the IDF, recommended that diabetes be diagnosed by measurement of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), which reflects long-term blood glucose concentrations (see HbA 1c section below). The ADA and the WHO have endorsed the use of HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes.

There are four key areas.

First, guidance is provided around the frequency and intensity of follow‐up for single Ab as well as multiple Ab individuals, the different stages of early‐stage presymptomatic T1D, in adults and children. The pros and cons of the different approaches to glucose monitoring (glycated haemoglobin, continuous glucose monitoring, self monitoring of blood glucose) are outlined and the utility of these different approaches at different stages is discussed. Importantly, advice is also provided around safety. The importance of regular education about symptoms of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis is highlighted and all health professionals involved in monitoring and care of these individuals have a responsibility to provide this education. At this time there are no formal recommendations of how appropriate monitoring and follow‐up pathways may be practically implemented given this is likely to be a novel service, and this will require attention and careful consideration.

Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

### Relationship between glycemic levels and treatment outcome among critically ill children admitted into emergency room in enugu [^114zo5vA]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Those children with hypoglycaemia were immediately managed according to standard protocols. Our protocol calls for initial bolus infusion of 4mls/kg of 10% dextrose water either intravenously or intraosseously followed by 10% dextrose maintenance. Feeding was also commenced as soon as is feasible for the patient. As for those with hyperglycemia, they were commenced on 0.9% saline solution and their blood glucose monitored closely. All necessary care was given to each patient according to their needs. For the purposes of this study, we chose to define hypoglycaemia as blood glucose level of ≤ 65 mg/dl and hyperglycemia as ≥ 110 mg/dl. Our main outcome measures were mortality and discharged.

All data were analysed using SPSS software version 20. Tables were presented accordingly. Associations between socio-demographics with glycemic level and treatment outcome were determined using Chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was equally done to ascertain predictors of treatment outcome. P value at level of ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant.

### Clinical recommendations for the use of the ambulatory glucose profile in diabetes care [^11242A6z]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) uses the wealth of data that are generated by continuous glucose monitoring, including flash glucose monitoring technologies, to provide a visual representation of glucose levels over a typical standard day of usually the most recent two weeks for a person with diabetes and helps to identify patterns and trends in glucose control. The AGP allows certain patterns of glucose levels to be identified and analyzed, such that treatment adjustments can be made, and new individual treatment goals can be defined. This helps to ensure increased treatment satisfaction and adherence, quality of life, and an improvement in metabolic management for people with diabetes.

Objective

To date, a range of approaches exists for interpreting the information contained in an AGP, with different priorities given to identifying and targeting patterns of hypoglycemia and the degree of variability and stability underlying the glucose levels. The objective of the present recommendation is to describe the steps for assessing an AGP in detail and to illustrate these steps using visual examples.

Conclusion

This paper describes the consensus recommendations from a group of German expert diabetologists on the necessary steps for assessing an AGP in a structured and detailed way and to explain these steps using practical clinical examples.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) — strength of recommendation classifications and interpretations specify that "1 — Strong recommendation for or against" applies when "Desirable consequences CLEARLY OUTWEIGH the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with patient interpretation that "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", clinician guidance that "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", and policy-maker interpretation that "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". It also defines "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against" when "Desirable consequences PROBABLY OUTWEIGH undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with patient interpretation that "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not", clinician guidance that "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual and that clinicians must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences", and policy-maker interpretation that "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate".

2022 American diabetes association updates

In 2023, the American Diabetes Association updated its standards of care to align with the Endocrine Society's recommendations, adopting a glycemic target range of 100–180 mg/dL for non-critical hospitalized patients. This change reflects evolving evidence and a broader consensus on optimal glycemic management in this patient population.

Treatment of hospital hyperglycemia (Tables 2, 3, 4) (Fig. 2)

Summary of evidence

Sliding scale insulin

All studies comparing the sliding scale insulin (SSI) regimen with other regimens have shown the inferiority and ineffectiveness of the sliding scale in controlling hyperglycemia. Therefore, when hospitalized patients present with more than two blood glucose levels above 180 mg/dL in 24 h, any hyperglycemia above 250 mg/dL, or are already using insulin at home, an effective hyperglycemia treatment should be implemented. Using the sliding scale alone is contraindicated. There are no studies comparing the efficacy of different types of correction scales. Table 4 presents the authors' suggestion for a supplemental insulin correction table. The chosen scale should be standardized by the institution and adjusted to effectively lower blood glucose levels without causing hypercorrection.

Basal-plus insulin therapy

Umpierrez et al. conducted a multicenter randomized study with 375 patients divided into three groups: basal-bolus, basal combined with correction scale (referred to as basal-plus in the study), and SSI alone. The study included hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, using oral medications or insulin up to a dose of 0.4 IU/kg/day. The basal-bolus and basal-plus groups achieved similar results, with less hyperglycemia and lower average daily blood glucose levels than the SSI group, without an increase in severe hypoglycemia. However, both basal groups experienced an increase in mild hypoglycemia compared to the SSI group.
Pasquel et al. evaluated a group of 279 hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, using oral medications or insulin up to a total dose of 0.6 IU/kg/day and blood glucose levels below 400 mg/dL, in a multicenter randomized study. They compared a group receiving basal insulin combined with sitagliptin to a group on basal-bolus insulin therapy. The outcomes were not inferior in terms of average daily blood glucose levels (171 ± 48.6 vs. 169.2 ± 48.6 mg/dL), hypoglycemia (9 vs. 12%), and treatment failure (16 vs. 19%) for the sitagliptin + basal group vs. the basal-bolus group, respectively.
