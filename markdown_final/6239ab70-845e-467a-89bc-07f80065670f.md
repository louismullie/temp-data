## Question

How to rate Curiosity in a medical resident

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to rate curiosity in a medical resident. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about operationalizing curiosity into observable behaviors that map to competencies. Then, I should verify feasible multi-source assessment methods, including direct observation and 360-degree input. Next, I need to develop behaviorally anchored rating scales with clear anchors, integrate self-assessment and reflection, and ensure reliability and validity. After that, I should consider longitudinal tracking with milestones, address evaluator bias, and connect results to program improvement and feedback practices. Finally, I will plan a validation-and-iteration cycle to refine the tool over time, making sure each step aligns with recognized frameworks and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the construct definition to avoid vague trait judgments. Curiosity in residency should be translated into specialty-agnostic, observable behaviors such as asking probing clinical questions, seeking information beyond guidelines, pursuing atypical findings, and following through with literature searches or mini-projects, because abstract traits require operationalization for reliable assessment and meaningful feedback in GME contexts [^112XvEpj] [^114vCdjh]. I should double-check that these behaviors align with established domains like practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal/communication skills to maintain coherence with ACGME frameworks and to facilitate CCC deliberations and milestone mapping [^1122fz4Y]. Wait, let me verify an existing proxy: the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning emphasizes attention to learning opportunities and technical skills in seeking information, which closely overlap with behavioral expressions of curiosity and provide convergent validity targets for any new measure [^113twXMB].

> Next, I should review multi-source assessment strategies. My first thought is to treat 360-degree evaluations as the "gold standard" for nontechnical competencies, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while 360s are useful, they are not a singular gold standard and should be complemented by direct observation and portfolio evidence for a fuller picture, especially for context-dependent behaviors like curiosity [^1141VpHC]. I will now examine how to deploy faculty, peers, nurses, and patients for distinct vantage points, while ensuring feasibility and rater training, and pair this with structured direct observation during rounds and patient encounters to capture curiosity-driven inquiry and follow-up behaviors in situ [^116iNmCR] [^115PU2wp]. I should confirm that tying 360 results to feedback processes is acceptable and useful for faculty; prior work suggests 360-informed feedback can improve comfort and skill in delivering professionalism feedback, which we can leverage for "curiosity" as well [^112JByBW].

> I need to ensure that rating scales are behaviorally anchored to reduce halo effects and ambiguity. Using a behaviorally anchored rating scale (BARS) approach, I will specify anchors from "needs development" through "exceptional" with concrete behavioral markers such as defaulting to first diagnosis without inquiry, sporadic follow-up questions with prompting, routine independent literature seeking and exploration of differentials, proactive investigation of atypical patterns with dissemination to team, and hypothesis generation that triggers QI or scholarly work, respectively [^111G4aCs]. Let me verify that this strategy parallels validated practice; simulation-based assessments using BARS have demonstrated strong generalizability coefficients and discrimination of performance levels, supporting the methodological choice to reduce rater variability and increase signal for growth over time [^111G4aCs] [^114vCdjh].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of resident self-assessment and reflection. Self-assessment alone is often nonspecific, with most learning objectives being general and centered on "read more", so I need to scaffold self-assessment with structure and require concrete examples of curiosity-in-action, such as the question generated, the search performed, the practice change proposed, and the patient impact observed [^115176WM]. Let me consider integrating brief, focused narrative reflections on cases where curiosity altered diagnosis, management, or patient understanding, drawing on narrative medicine methods that enhance attention, representation, and affiliation, and that residents find meaningful for reconnecting purpose to practice [^112KhBzB] [^11178mt6].

> I should double-check the psychometric plan so the tool is credible to CCCs and PECs. Reliability targets should include internal consistency and short-interval test-retest stability, informed by the JSPLL's alpha of 0.89 and test-retest of 0.91 as aspirational benchmarks for scales capturing learning orientation and information-seeking behaviors that overlap with curiosity [^113twXMB]. For score reliability across raters and settings, I need to obtain generalizability evidence; BARS-based simulation work achieving G coefficients around 0.81 suggests a reasonable target for multi-rater, multi-context assessment of curiosity behaviors, though I will need to estimate our own facets and adjust sampling accordingly [^111G4aCs]. Construct validity should be examined through correlations with criterion measures like documented literature searches, journal club participation, QI involvement, and observed follow-through on atypical cases, consistent with validity arguments for professional competencies [^114vCdjh].

> Let me think about longitudinal assessment and milestones to avoid snapshot bias. Curiosity should be tracked semiannually within the existing ACGME Milestones cadence, with CCCs integrating multiple data points to render a programmatic judgment that can show developmental trajectories rather than one-off impressions [^1122fz4Y]. I should confirm that milestone-based longitudinal analyses can detect growth patterns; anesthesiology milestones work demonstrates how aggregated subcompetency trajectories and outcomes at graduation can be characterized, which we can adapt to a curiosity-aligned subcompetency or within practice-based learning descriptors, while guarding against straight-lining and ensuring sufficient sampling over time [^111N3dfL] [^1122fz4Y].

> I need to ensure proactive bias mitigation in ratings. Gender bias and other implicit biases can distort assessment of nontechnical behaviors, so I should standardize prompts, train raters, and include calibration sessions to align interpretations of curiosity anchors, while monitoring for differential item functioning across groups [^116mjHHn]. But wait, what if implicit attitudinal differences toward mental health conditions or other patient factors skew perceptions of curiosity during complex encounters; documenting and discussing such influences with raters can reduce unrecognized variance, as pilot work on residents' implicit biases illustrates the need for awareness and structure in assessments of interpersonal and cognitive behaviors [^114vax3B]. I should also review how differing perceptions of autonomy and entrustment can interplay with evaluations; structured faculty discussions and cross-rater reviews can surface divergence and potential bias, improving fairness in the latitude given to display curiosity in the clinical environment [^111ydLE4] [^116gpyh7].

> Next, I should review how to use the data for program improvement. Aggregating curiosity-related ratings at the program level allows the PEC to identify cohort trends and curricular needs, aligning with the expectation that milestones inform educational quality improvement and design adjustments by PDs, CCCs, and PECs [^1122fz4Y]. If curiosity behaviors lag in particular rotations or PGY levels, I can implement targeted interventions such as teaching on formulating answerable clinical questions, ambiguous or exploratory simulation scenarios to reward inquiry strategies, narrative sessions that reconnect meaning to investigation, and protected time for scholarly follow-through where surveys suggest academic time is scarce [^111G4aCs] [^112KhBzB] [^116MfQsc].

> I should confirm feedback practices that make curiosity coachable and safe. Faculty need brief, structured approaches that elicit the learner's cognitive frames, maintain psychological safety, and connect behaviors to outcomes; a 1-hour intervention improved feedback quality along precisely these dimensions and can be adapted to curiosity-focused debriefs that ask why a resident pursued or did not pursue a line of inquiry and what they will test next [^113e9G7i]. I need to check that faculty comfort rises with the use of structured assessments; deploying 360 data to guide feedback increased faculty comfort and perceived skill in professionalism feedback, suggesting similar gains are plausible for curiosity coaching if we provide anchors and exemplars [^112JByBW].

> I will now examine the validation and iteration cycle. Pilot testing with a small set of residents and faculty, followed by a double-interview method to reconcile intended versus interpreted meaning of items, helps refine anchors and prompts for clarity and fidelity, reducing construct-irrelevant variance [^113bJs7g]. Hmm, wait a minute, our participation rates could undermine validity if too few raters contribute; leveraging proven tactics to optimize survey response in GME, including timing sensitivity and relationship-building for multi-rater tools, will be important during scale-up and ongoing monitoring [^1145kXsr]. Criterion-related checks should include associations between curiosity ratings and subsequent scholarly activity, in-training exam performance in domains requiring self-directed learning, and patient experience elements tied to attentiveness and thoroughness, adjusting for rotation exposure and case mix [^113twXMB].

> Let me reconsider whether we can tie curiosity to underlying learning mechanisms to justify why we are rewarding certain behaviors. Empirical work on human curiosity suggests that people optimize for learning progress, not just task difficulty, implying that residents who select tractable, information-rich questions and iterate based on evolving competence are exhibiting adaptive curiosity that should be recognized in anchors and coaching prompts [^116Fndrb]. I need to ensure anchors capture this nuance by valuing strategic selection of questions likely to yield progress, documentation of what was learned, and adjustments when avenues prove unproductive, thereby aligning behavioral assessment with cognitive science of curiosity and efficient exploration [^116Fndrb] [^116Eapum].

> In summary, rating curiosity in residents requires translating it into observable, competency-aligned behaviors, collecting multisource and directly observed evidence with behaviorally anchored scales, integrating structured self-reflection, ensuring psychometric rigor, tracking longitudinally within milestones, mitigating bias, using the data for targeted program improvement, and delivering psychologically safe, frame-seeking feedback, all validated through pilot testing and iterative refinement linked to meaningful outcomes and learning mechanisms [^114vCdjh] [^1122fz4Y] [^111G4aCs] [^113twXMB] [^113e9G7i] [^116Fndrb].

Curiosity in medical residents should be assessed using a **multi-source, behavior-based approach** that combines direct observation [^116iNmCR], 360-degree feedback [^1141VpHC], and self-assessment [^113twXMB], anchored to explicit, observable behaviors aligned with ACGME competencies [^116jBMxp] [^112XvEpj]. This approach yields **reliable, valid, and actionable** data by triangulating input from faculty, peers, nurses, and patients [^1141VpHC] and by using structured tools such as behaviorally anchored rating scales [^111G4aCs] and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning [^113twXMB]. With clear feedback [^113e9G7i] [^112JByBW] and individualized learning plans [^112XvEpj], **regular, longitudinal assessment** supports resident growth and program improvement [^1122fz4Y].

## Defining curiosity in medical residency

Curiosity in medical residency is the **intrinsic motivation to seek new knowledge** [^116Fndrb], ask questions, and explore uncertainties in clinical practice. It is reflected in consistent questioning about patient care, medical knowledge, and clinical processes; active learning by seeking new information, guidelines, and evidence-based practices; reflection through self-assessment to identify knowledge gaps and pursue improvement [^115176WM] [^114vCdjh]; and innovation by proposing and testing new approaches to clinical problems.

---

## Observable behaviors indicative of curiosity

To assess curiosity effectively, it is essential to identify **observable behaviors** that can be measured consistently [^114vCdjh]. Table 1 outlines specific behaviors indicative of curiosity in medical residents [^112XvEpj].

| **Behavioral domain** | **Observable behaviors** |
|-|-|
| Questioning and inquiry | - Regularly asks insightful questions during rounds and conferences <br/> - Seeks clarification when uncertain <br/> - Engages in discussions about differential diagnoses and management plans |
| Active learning | - Independently reviews literature and guidelines <br/> - Participates actively in educational activities <br/> - Demonstrates knowledge acquisition through application in clinical practice |
| Reflection | - Engages in self-assessment and reflective practice <br/> - Identifies knowledge gaps and seeks feedback <br/> - Develops and follows through on individualized learning plans |
| Innovation | - Proposes new ideas or approaches to clinical problems <br/> - Participates in quality improvement or research projects <br/> - Demonstrates adaptability and openness to change |

## Assessment tools and methods

Several **assessment tools and methods** can evaluate curiosity in medical residents:

---

### Direct observation and behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS)

Direct observation of residents' behaviors during clinical practice [^116iNmCR], combined with BARS [^111G4aCs], provides a **structured and objective** method for assessing curiosity. BARS define specific behaviors associated with different levels of curiosity, allowing evaluators to rate residents consistently [^111G4aCs].

---

### 360-degree feedback

360-degree feedback involves collecting evaluations from multiple sources, including faculty, peers, nurses, and patients [^1141VpHC]. This method provides a **comprehensive assessment** of residents' curiosity-related behaviors across different clinical contexts [^112JByBW].

---

### Self-assessment and reflective practice

Self-assessment tools and reflective practice exercises encourage residents to evaluate their curiosity and identify areas for improvement [^115176WM]. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JSPLL) [^113twXMB] is a **validated instrument** that measures physicians' orientation toward lifelong learning, closely related to curiosity.

---

### Simulation-based assessment

Simulation-based assessments provide controlled environments to observe residents' **curiosity-driven behaviors**, such as questioning, problem-solving, and adaptability [^111G4aCs]. They can identify critical gaps in performance and curiosity-related behaviors.

---

## Reliability and validity of assessment methods

The **reliability and validity** of curiosity assessment methods vary [^114vCdjh]:

- **Direct observation and BARS**: High reliability and validity when evaluators are trained and behaviors are clearly defined [^111G4aCs].

- **360-degree feedback**: High reliability and validity due to multiple evaluators and diverse clinical contexts [^1141VpHC].

- **Self-assessment**: Moderate reliability and validity; residents may overestimate or underestimate their curiosity levels [^112QrfFV].

- **Simulation-based assessment**: High validity in controlled settings; reliability depends on standardized scenarios and trained evaluators [^111G4aCs].

---

## Integration with ACGME competencies

Curiosity aligns with **practice-based learning and improvement** [^116jBMxp] by driving continuous learning, self-assessment, and quality improvement. It also supports medical knowledge by motivating residents to seek and apply new knowledge [^1149pddE]. Within professionalism, curiosity fosters humility, honesty, and a commitment to lifelong learning [^112XvEpj] [^113twXMB].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Assessing curiosity in medical residents presents **several challenges**:

- **Subjectivity**: Evaluators may interpret behaviors differently, leading to inconsistent ratings [^114vCdjh].

- **Bias**: Gender, cultural, and implicit biases may influence evaluations [^116mjHHn] [^116gpyh7].

- **Time constraints**: Busy clinical environments may limit opportunities for observation and feedback [^113e9G7i].

- **Lack of standardized tools**: Limited availability of validated instruments specifically designed to assess curiosity [^114vCdjh].

---

## Strategies to enhance curiosity assessment

To improve curiosity assessment in medical residents, **programs should**:

- **Develop clear behavioral anchors**: Define specific behaviors associated with curiosity [^111G4aCs].

- **Train evaluators**: Provide training to reduce bias and improve consistency [^113e9G7i].

- **Use multiple assessment methods**: Combine direct observation, 360-degree feedback, and self-assessment [^114vCdjh].

- **Provide regular feedback**: Offer timely, constructive feedback to residents [^112JByBW].

- **Foster a supportive learning environment**: Encourage questioning, reflection, and innovation [^114fCr9y].

## Impact of curiosity on clinical performance and patient outcomes

Curiosity enhances **clinical reasoning** by prompting exploration of differential diagnoses and consideration of alternative management strategies. It improves patient care by supporting better-informed decisions and outcomes. It also reduces errors by encouraging residents to question assumptions and identify potential mistakes [^112XUcUn].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Curiosity is a critical attribute in medical residency training, driving continuous learning, clinical reasoning, and patient care improvement [^114vCdjh]. A **multi-method assessment** approach, including direct observation [^116iNmCR], 360-degree feedback [^1141VpHC], and self-assessment [^113twXMB], provides a comprehensive and reliable evaluation of curiosity. Programs should define clear behavioral anchors [^111G4aCs], train evaluators [^113e9G7i], and foster supportive learning environments [^114fCr9y] to enhance curiosity assessment and resident development.

### Orthopaedic surgery residency milestones: Initial formulation and future directions [^1122fz4Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Low credibility.

Milestones are a report of programmatic judgment of a resident's level of competence based on multiple assessments. Under the system assessment, data are collected from individual faculty raters and collated by the Clinical Competency Committee (CCC). Every 6 months, the CCC deliberates and generates reporting milestones for each resident. The milestone ratings sent to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) represent the resident's competence at that point in time. In this way, the milestones have become a summative assessment. Milestones in aggregate should also be used for program improvement by the program director (PD), CCC, and the Program Evaluation Committee (PEC).

The PEC should look at overall milestone reports within the program and is charged with a biannual review of data. The PEC comprises faculty members, residents, and others expert in the program's overall design. It is ultimately responsible for the design and implementation of quality improvement efforts regarding the educational program. This is one way in which the milestones and other resident assessments can be used to provide feedback to the program and for the PD to adjust the overall program design.

This process provides continuous data for educational quality improvement of residency programs. Milestones track individual progress through each area. The incorporation of the milestones is designed to guide residents toward understanding what is expected of them in key areas. The specialty of orthopaedics is a 5-year training program; ACGME specifically avoided an association between postgraduate year and level. Milestone level 1 corresponds with…

### Operationalizing professionalism: A meaningful and practical integration for resident education [^112XvEpj]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

The objectives and hypothesis of this study are to review contemporary definitions of professionalism and apply them to resident evaluation and education.

- **Data sources**: A review of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar was conducted.

- **Review methods**: Articles and bibliographies from 1980 to 2012 were reviewed for definitions, evaluation, and education of professionalism in resident training.

- **Results**: Our initial search returned 291 articles, with 67 articles included in the final review. Definitions of professionalism often focused on attitudes and traits such as honesty, altruism, self-reflection, reliability, and respect for others. The operationalization of such abstract definitions is challenging as they are subject to variable interpretations when translated into measurable behaviors. Despite the challenges, specific behavioral benchmarks can be developed and utilized for evaluation with available methods, including patient/nurse surveys, faculty observation, objective structured clinical exams (OSCE), ethical reasoning tests, and completion of administrative tasks. Curriculums have often been lecture-based, limiting the ability to transmit professional values and behaviors. Professionalism is taught most effectively through multiple modalities, including mentorship, faculty role modeling, self-reflection, and resident professionalism portfolios. For professionalism evaluation and education to be effective, the curriculum should be developed as a collaborative effort between residents and faculty.

- **Conclusions**: Professionalism training requires practical, behavior-based definitions of professionalism.

### Assessing physicians' orientation toward lifelong learning [^113twXMB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the importance of lifelong learning as an element of professionalism, no psychometrically sound instrument is available for its assessment among physicians.

- **Objective**: To assess the validity and reliability of an instrument developed to measure physicians' orientation toward lifelong learning.

- **Design**: Mail survey.

- **Participants**: Seven hundred and twenty-one physicians, of whom 444 (62%) responded.

- **Measurement**: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JSPLL), which includes 19 items answered on a 4-point Likert scale, was used with additional questions about respondents' professional activities related to continuous learning.

- **Results**: Factor analysis of the JSPLL yielded four subscales: "professional learning beliefs and motivation", "scholarly activities", "attention to learning opportunities", and "technical skills in seeking information", which are consistent with widely recognized features of lifelong learning. The validity of the scale and its subscales was supported by significant correlations with a set of criterion measures that presumably require continuous learning. The internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of the JSPLL was 0.89, and the test-retest reliability was 0.91.

- **Conclusions**: Empirical evidence supports the validity and reliability of the JSPLL.

### Patient, faculty, and self-assessment of radiology resident performance: A 360-degree method of measuring professionalism and interpersonal/communication skills [^1141VpHC]. Academic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

To develop and test the reliability, validity, and feasibility of a 360-degree evaluation to measure radiology resident competence in professionalism and interpersonal/communication skills, an evaluation form with 10 Likert-type items related to these skills was completed by residents, supervising radiologists, and patients after resident-patient interactions related to breast biopsy procedures. Residents were also evaluated by faculty using an end-of-rotation global rating form. After a 7-month period, residents, faculty, and technologists were queried regarding their reaction to the assessments.

Fifty-six complete 360-degree data sets (range: 2–14 per resident) and seven rotational evaluations for seven residents were analyzed and compared. Internal consistency reliability estimates were 0.85, 0.86, and 0.87 for resident, patient, and faculty 360-degree evaluations, respectively. Correlations between resident-versus-patient, resident-versus-faculty, and patient-versus-faculty ratings for the 56 interactions were -0.06 (P = 0.64), 0.31 (P < .02), and 0.45 (P < .0006), respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients approached significant correlation (0.70) between the faculty global rating and patient 360-degree scores (P = 0.08) but not with faculty 360-degree scores. Residents and faculty felt that completing the 360-degree forms was easy, but the requirement for faculty presence during the consent process was burdensome.

### Defining and assessing professional competence [^114vCdjh]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Assessment formats for physicians and trainees reliably test core knowledge and basic skills. However, they may underemphasize some important domains of professional medical practice, including interpersonal skills, lifelong learning, professionalism, and the integration of core knowledge into clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To propose a definition of professional competence, review means for assessing it, and suggest new approaches to assessment.

- **Data sources**: We searched the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 2001 and reference lists of relevant articles for English-language studies on the reliability or validity of measures of competence for physicians, medical students, and residents.

- **Study selection**: We excluded articles of a purely descriptive nature, duplicate reports, reviews, and opinions and position statements, which yielded 195 relevant citations.

- **Data extraction**: Data were abstracted by one of us (R.M.E.). Quality criteria for inclusion were broad, given the heterogeneity of interventions, complexity of outcome measures, and paucity of randomized or longitudinal study designs.

- **Data synthesis**: We generated an inclusive definition of competence: the habitual and judicious use of communication, knowledge, technical skills, clinical reasoning, emotions, values, and reflection in daily practice for the benefit of the individual and the community being served. Aside from protecting the public and limiting access to advanced training, assessments should foster habits of learning and self-reflection and drive institutional change.

### Measuring clinical preparedness after residency training: development of a new instrument [^11329FuT]. Family Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Research on preparedness for independent clinical practice typically uses surveys of residents and program directors near graduation, which can be affected by several biases. To overcome this, we developed a novel approach to assess new graduates more objectively using physician and staff member assessors three months after graduates started their first job.

- **Methods**: We conducted a literature review and key informant interviews with physicians from various practice types and geographic regions in the United States to identify features indicating a lack of preparedness for independent clinical practice. A Clinical Preparedness Measurement Summit was then held, engaging measurement experts and family medicine education leaders to build consensus on key indicators of readiness for independent clinical practice and survey development strategies. The 2015 entrustable professional activities for family medicine end-of-residency training provided the framework for assessment by physician assessors. Sixteen published variables assessing interpersonal communication skills and processes of care delivery were identified for staff assessors. Frequencies were assessed, and survey findings between physician and staff assessors were compared in 2016 to assist with survey validation.

- **Results**: The assessment of frequencies demonstrated a range of responses, supporting the instrument's ability to distinguish readiness for independent practice among recent graduate hires. There were no statistical differences between physician and staff assessors for the same physician evaluations, reinforcing the tool's validity.

### What are doctors for? A call for compassion-based metrics as a measure of physician value [^1136ZEdL]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Modern measures of physician value are couched in terms of productivity, volume, finance, outcomes, cure rates, and the acquisition of an increasingly vast knowledge base. This inherently feeds burnout and imposter syndrome as physicians experience an inability to measure up to unrealistic standards set externally and perceived internally. Ancient and modern wisdom suggests that where populations fail to flourish, at root is a failure to grasp a vision or true purpose. Traditional philosophical conceptions of a physician's purpose center around compassion, empathy, and humanism, which are key to thwarting burnout and recovering professional satisfaction. New compassion-based metrics are urgently needed and will positively impact physician well-being and improve population health.

### The infant and toddler curiosity questionnaire: A validated caregiver-report measure of curiosity in children from 5 to 24 months [^1155LBJm]. Infancy (2025). Low credibility.

We chose a 7-point Likert scale from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 7 ("strongly agree") as the response scale, with an option of "not applicable (NA)" if respondents could not think of any recent situation allowing them to rate a specific item or because their child had not yet been able to show the behavior. Items were created in English initially targeting British caregivers and were repeatedly reviewed and improved based on the topical expertise of the authors, as well as through discussions with parents and native speakers to ensure their content validity. For further considerations regarding the response scale and online presentation, see Supporting Information S1: Section S2.

### Simulation-based assessment to identify critical gaps in safe anesthesia resident performance [^111G4aCs]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Valid methods are needed to identify anesthesia resident performance gaps early in training. However, many assessment tools in medicine have not been properly validated. The authors designed and tested the use of a behaviorally anchored scale as part of a multiscenario simulation-based assessment system to identify high- and low-performing residents concerning domains of greatest concern to expert anesthesiology faculty.

- **Methods**: An expert faculty panel derived five key behavioral domains of interest by using a Delphi process: (1) synthesizes information to formulate a clear anesthetic plan; (2) implements a plan based on changing conditions; (3) demonstrates effective interpersonal and communication skills with patients and staff; (4) identifies ways to improve performance; and (5) recognizes own limits. Seven simulation scenarios spanning pre-to-postoperative encounters were used to assess the performances of 22 first-year residents and 8 fellows from two institutions. Two of 10 trained faculty raters, blinded to trainee program and training level, scored each performance independently using a behaviorally anchored rating scale. Residents, fellows, facilitators, and raters completed surveys.

- **Results**: Evidence supporting the reliability and validity of the assessment scores was procured, including a high generalizability coefficient (ρ = 0.81) and expected performance differences between first-year resident and fellow participants. A majority of trainees, facilitators, and raters judged the assessment to be useful, realistic, and representative of critical skills.

### From self-efficacy to imposter syndrome: The intrapersonal traits of surgeons [^1157Enj2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Building a successful and long-standing career in surgery — from residency through practice — is contingent on factors beyond technical prowess. A wide range of personal traits, although seemingly more difficult to quantify than technical competency alone, have become increasingly recognized as pivotal to physician mental health, well-being, and in preventing physician burnout. By contrast, traits such as maladaptive perfectionism and imposter syndrome have been shown to be associated with increased rates of negative mental health effects and impaired job performance. Given the pervasiveness and negative sequelae of burnout, in addition to generalized career dissatisfaction in surgery, there is an urgent need to evaluate traits distinct from surgical skill, such as self-efficacy, imposter syndrome, assertiveness, and perceived likeability.

It has been widely established that there are gender differences among these traits. For example, female surgical residents report a relative lack of both self-perceived clinical confidence and autonomy in comparison with their equally qualified male peers. For other traits, such as self-efficacy, the effects of sex are mixed or have yet to be analyzed among surgical trainees. Self-rated likeability is another trait that has not been thoroughly analyzed among this population and was chosen as our fifth trait of interest, given that it has been shown to correlate with maladaptive personality traits, self-esteem, and individual differences in anxiety, depression, and avoidance.

### Measuring wisdom: Existing approaches, continuing challenges, and new developments [^114cwFyn]. The Journals of Gerontology. Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of wisdom is not exactly easy, but it is a fascinating area of research. Currently, we have a relatively small toolbox of established methods that are very useful, as long as we remain aware of their limitations. Several recent studies have triangulated different approaches by testing whether findings hold across both performance and self-report measures. In the future, new developments may lead to even more ecologically valid methods. Perhaps this overview will incite the creativity of some methodologists.

### "The forest and the trees": A narrative medicine curriculum by residents for residents [^112KhBzB]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

In the article "A Plea for Narrative Medicine in Pediatric Residency Training", Diorio and Nowaczyk argue for the integration of narrative medicine (NM) into pediatrics residency programs, given the tragedy, stress, and isolation routinely encountered in training. Their plea took on new weight in the COVID-19 era, when healthcare professionals faced greater responsibilities amid tremendous loss and a sharp rise in burnout, particularly for resident physicians. The pandemic also highlighted healthcare disparities, police brutality, and violence in communities of color. This exposure led to a critical examination of medical culture and an exploration of how healthcare professionals, pediatricians in particular, can discuss anxiety and loss and regain fulfillment in their work. NM, a branch of health humanities, with its conceptual framework of attention, representation, and affiliation, seeks to create opportunities for reflection, group cohesion, and the development of skills of close listening among those engaged in delivering healthcare.

Peer teaching and support are increasingly valued in medical education. Studies have demonstrated that physicians often identify peers as the most acceptable sources of support, and that resident wellness particularly benefits from peer-support interventions. Trainees value learning from peers due to their social and cognitive congruence, creating a climate of safety and comfort in which learners can be more vulnerable with each other. Given the recognized benefits of peer education and support, and the relative shortage of training resources, it is essential to leverage these peer relationships effectively in medical education programs.

### Resident assessment of clinician educators according to core ACGME competencies [^111CHGLn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires faculty to pursue annual development to enhance their teaching skills. Few studies exist on how to identify and improve the quality of teaching provided by faculty educators. Understanding the correlation between numeric scores assigned to faculty educators and their tangible, practical teaching skills would be beneficial.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to identify and describe qualities that differentiate numerically highly rated and low-rated physician educators.

- **Design**: This observational mixed-methods study evaluated attending physician educators between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2021. Quantitative analysis involved descriptive statistics, normalization of scores, and stratification of faculty into tertiles based on a summary score. We compared the highest and lowest tertiles during qualitative analyses of residents' comments.

- **Participants**: Twenty-five attending physicians and 111 residents in an internal medicine residency program.

- **Main measures**: Resident evaluations of faculty educators, including 724 individual assessments of faculty educators on 15 variables related to the ACGME core competencies.

- **Key results**: Quantitative analyses revealed variation in attending physician educators' performance across the ACGME core competencies. The highest-rated teaching qualities were interpersonal and communication skills, medical knowledge, and professionalism, while the lowest-rated teaching quality was systems-based practice. Qualitative analyses identified themes distinguishing high-quality educators.

### Validity of faculty and resident global assessment of medical students' clinical knowledge during their pediatrics clerkship [^1122JW9a]. Academic Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Medical knowledge is one of six core competencies in medicine. Medical student assessments should be valid and reliable. We assessed the relationship between faculty and resident global assessment of pediatric medical student knowledge and performance on a standardized test in medical knowledge.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cross-sectional study of medical students on a pediatric clerkship in the academic year 2008–2009 at one academic health center. Faculty and residents rated students' clinical knowledge on a 5-point Likert scale. The inter-rater reliability of clinical knowledge ratings was assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for residents' ratings, faculty ratings, and both rating types combined. Convergent validity between clinical knowledge ratings and scores on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) clinical subject examination in pediatrics was assessed with Pearson product moment correlation and the coefficient of determination.

- **Results**: There was moderate agreement for global clinical knowledge ratings by faculty and moderate agreement for ratings by residents. The agreement was also moderate when faculty and resident ratings were combined. Global ratings of clinical knowledge had high convergent validity with pediatric examination scores when students were rated by both residents and faculty.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings provide evidence for convergent validity of global assessment of medical students' clinical knowledge with NBME subject examination scores in pediatrics.

### A historical perspective on resident evaluation, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Outcome Project and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour requirement [^116jBMxp]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Outcome Project, endorsed at the 1999 ACGME annual meeting, was intended to shift the focus of residency program requirements and accreditation from process-oriented assessment to an assessment of outcomes. The Outcome Project established six general competencies, each of which is supported by more specific competencies.

- **Methods**: We compared contemporary resident evaluation based on the Outcome Project to faculty evaluation of a surgical resident at Mayo Clinic that was completed in 1917.

- **Results**: The contemporary faculty assessment of resident performance was remarkably similar to the evaluation form and criteria used in 1917. All six general competencies, and nearly all of the more specific items listed under each general competency, were included in the 1917 evaluation. Duty hour data as a component of the 1917 resident evaluation included the number of hours per week spent in "practical work", "medical library", and "research work".

- **Conclusions**: The remarkable similarities between the qualities assessed in the 1917 evaluation and the assessment of contemporary ACGME competencies suggest that a common set of desirable physician characteristics and behaviors can be identified and measured.

### Promoting wellness in orthopaedic surgery residency [^1153EaSn]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In an ideal world, the attributes that make physicians successful and resilient would have already begun to be developed before starting residency. Grit, a positive noncognitive trait that is based on an individual's passion for a particular long-term goal, coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve his or her objective, has been shown to be a greater predictor of success than intelligence. When combating the many instances of failure or setback in residency, the ability to promote resilience among learners and colleagues is one of the most beneficial ways to improve confidence and prevent feelings of inadequacy. Higher grit scores have correlated with greater well-being of surgeons, a lower surgical resident attrition rate, decreased burnout for attending surgeons, and higher rates of career satisfaction. Even before starting residency, orthopaedic applicants have been shown to score in the 70th percentile for grit assessment when compared with the general population. However, grit is not necessarily a trait that spans all areas of a person's life, because an individual may display grit in certain instances over others. For example, a collegiate athlete who required grit, perseverance, and determination to succeed in his/her/their athletic career may fall short in performance during residency. This can also be seen in residents who succeeded in medical school but start residency and the drive and grit that were seen as a student are gone. The hope, however, is that by nurturing and further developing the grit that allowed residents to succeed in medical school and fostering

### Identifying psychosocial and contextual markers considered by physicians to personalize care [^113bJs7g]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The development of the questionnaire involved several iterations, alternating between the conception and pilot testing phases. Pilot testing involved nine physicians and two medical residents. The functionality and feasibility of the questionnaire — such as the time needed, the number of participants, and reasons for dropping out — as well as its clarity and comprehensibility were assessed using a double interview method. During this process, one member of the research team (PD) reviewed the questionnaire with pilot participants and asked them to explain what the questions meant to them and why they answered in one way or another. Discrepancies between what was intended and what was understood, along with potential modifications, were discussed.

The initial versions of the questionnaire began with the presentation of the twelve domains identified by Binns-Calvey (i.e. access to care, competing responsibilities, social support, financial situation, environment, resources, skills, abilities and knowledge, emotional state, cultural perspectives/spiritual beliefs, attitudes toward illness, attitudes toward healthcare providers and the system, and health behaviors). Examples of factors that might be included under each theme were also provided. However, pilot participants reported that this did influence their answers. As a result, the final questionnaire consisted of a single broad open-ended question that invited respondents to describe up to three different situations during which they had personalized care in the past: "Describe a situation where you adapted treatment because of the patient's specific circumstances".

### An exploration of residents' implicit biases towards depression - a pilot study [^114vax3B]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Implicit attitudes are outside of conscious awareness and are thought to affect automatic responses outside of one's deliberate control, with the potential to impact physician-patient relationships.

- **Objective**: To measure the nature and extent of implicit biases towards depression in internal medicine and psychiatry residents.

- **Design**: Descriptive and comparative study.

- **Participants**: Fifty-one residents from three internal medicine programs and 35 residents from three psychiatry programs located in two states.

- **Interventions**: Participants were sent a link to voluntarily participate in four online implicit association tests. Residents' identities were anonymous.

- **Main measures**: Four implicit association tests to measure the association of (1) attitude (good/bad), (2) permanence, (3) controllability, and (4) etiology with depression/physical illness.

- **Key results**: Internal medicine residents demonstrated a significant association between depression and negative attitudes (t(38) = 6.01, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = .95), uncontrollability (t(35) = 4.80, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = .79), temporariness (t(37) = 2.94, p = .006, Cohen's d = .48), and a psychological etiology (t(1) = 6.91, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.24). Psychiatry residents only demonstrated an association between depression and a psychological etiology (t(2) = 4.79, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 4.5). When comparing the two specialties, internal medicine and psychiatry differed on two of the IATs. Internal medicine residents were more likely to associate negative attitudes with depression than psychiatry residents (t(63) = 4.66, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.18).

### Prevalence and predictors of physician-patient discordance in prognostic perceptions in advanced cancer [^113PstFV]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

We assessed patients' background factors, including age, sex, nationality, religiosity, education, health literacy using a set of brief screening questions, and numeracy with the subjective numeracy scale. Regarding clinical factors, physicians registered the date of diagnosis of metastatic/inoperable cancer to calculate the time since diagnosis, line of systemic treatment during study participation, and tumor type. Patients reported their health-related quality of life using the Global Health Status subscale of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire.

In addition, we measured personal factors such as trait optimism with the life orientation test-revised, trait anxiety with the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, fighting spirit with the Mini Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, avoidance coping with the Utrecht Coping List, and uncertainty tolerance with the tolerance for ambiguity.

We also assessed relational factors that included trust in the physician using the Trust in Oncologist Scale-Short Form and prognostic information-related factors. The latter comprised prognostic information preferences, for example, "Are you a person who wants to know the likelihood of dying from your cancer within 1 year from now?" with a Yes/No option; self-reported prognostic discussions, such as "Did the physician inform you about your life expectancy?" with options Yes, No, or I don't know; the main source of prognostic perceptions, such as "On what do you base your perceptions of prognosis primarily?" with options healthcare provider, family or friends, support group, internet, books, or personal beliefs; and perceived adequacy of prognostic information, specifically, "What do you think of the amount of prognostic information provided by your physician?"

### Humans monitor learning progress in curiosity-driven exploration [^116Fndrb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Curiosity-driven learning is foundational to human cognition. By enabling humans to autonomously decide when and what to learn, curiosity has been argued to be crucial for self-organizing temporally extended learning curricula. However, the mechanisms driving people to set intrinsic goals, when they are free to explore multiple learning activities, are still poorly understood. Computational theories propose different heuristics, including competence measures (e.g. percent correct) and learning progress, that could be used as intrinsic utility functions to efficiently organize exploration. Such intrinsic utilities constitute computationally cheap but smart heuristics to prevent people from laboring in vain on unlearnable activities, while still motivating them to self-challenge on difficult learnable activities.

Here, we provide empirical evidence for these ideas by means of a free-choice experimental paradigm and computational modeling. We show that while humans rely on competence information to avoid easy tasks, models that include a learning-progress component provide the best fit to task selection data. These results bridge the research in artificial and biological curiosity, reveal strategies that are used by humans but have not been considered in computational research, and introduce tools for probing how humans become intrinsically motivated to learn and acquire interests and skills on extended time scales.

### Resident identification of learning objectives after performing self-assessment based upon the ACGME core competencies [^115176WM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Self-assessment is increasingly being incorporated into competency evaluation in residency training. Little research has investigated the characteristics of residents' learning objectives and action plans after self-assessment.

- **Objective**: To explore the frequency and specificity of residents' learning objectives and action plans after completing either a highly or minimally structured self-assessment.

- **Design**: Internal Medicine residents (N = 90) were randomized to complete a highly or minimally structured self-assessment instrument based on the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Core Competencies. All residents then identified learning objectives and action plans.

- **Measurements**: Learning objectives and action plans were analyzed for content. Differences in specificity and content related to form, gender, and training level were assessed.

- **Results**: Seventy-six residents (84% response rate) identified 178 learning objectives. Objectives were general (79%), most often focused on medical knowledge (40%), and were not related to the type of form completed (p > 0.01). "Reading more" was the most common action plan.

- **Conclusions**: Residents commonly identify general learning objectives focusing on medical knowledge regardless of the structure of the self-assessment form. Tools and processes that further facilitate self-assessment should be identified.

### Spirituality and medicine. A workshop for medical students and residents [^112bCEPD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Governing bodies for medical education recommend that spirituality and medicine be incorporated into training. The aim was to pilot a workshop on spirituality and medicine on a convenience sample of preclinical medical students and internal medicine residents. The study intended to determine whether content was relevant to learners at different levels, assess whether preliminary evaluation was promising, and generate hypotheses for future research.

- **Setting**: Private medical school and university primary care internal medicine residency program, both located in the Northeast.

- **Curriculum description**: The authors designed and implemented a required 2-hour workshop for all second-year medical students and a separate required 1.5-hour workshop for all primary care internal medicine house staff. The workshops utilized multiple educational strategies including lecture, discussion, and role-play to address educational objectives.

- **Program evaluation**: Learners completed optional, anonymous pre- and post-workshop surveys, which included six 5-point Likert-rated statements and space to cite the most useful part of the curriculum and their remaining questions. One hundred thirty-seven learners participated, and 100 completed both surveys. Medical students and residents showed increased (all P ≤ .002) agreement regarding the appropriateness of inquiring about spiritual and religious beliefs in the medical encounter, their perceived competence in taking a spiritual history, and their perceived knowledge of available pastoral care resources. Medical students, but not residents, had an increase in their perceived comfort in discussing spirituality.

### Effect of holistic review, interview blinding, and structured questions in resident selection: Can we predict who will do well in a residency interview [^114i42X4]. Urology (2023). Low credibility.

To examine the Urology residency application process, particularly the interview, is the primary objective of this study. Historically, the residency interview has been vulnerable to bias and has not been determined to be a predictor of future residency performance. Our goal is to determine the relationship between pre-interview metrics and post-interview ranking using the best practices for Urology resident selection, including holistic review, blinded interviews, and structured behaviorally anchored questions.

Applications were assessed on cognitive attributes, such as Alpha Omega Alpha, class rank, and junior year clinical clerkship grades, and non-cognitive attributes, such as letters of recommendation (LOR), personal statement (PS), demographics, research, and personal characteristics. Reviewers were blinded to USMLE scores and photographs. Interviewers were blinded to the application, except for the PS and LORs. Interviews consisted of a structured behaviorally anchored interview (SBI) and an unstructured interview (UI). Odds ratios were determined by comparing pre-interview and interview impressions.

Fifty-one applicants were included in the analysis. The USMLE step 1 score (average 245) was associated with Alpha Omega Alpha, class rank, junior year clinical clerkship, and PS. The UI score was associated with the LOR (P = 0.04), whereas SBI scores were not (P = 0.5). Faculty rank was associated with SBI, UI, and overall interview (OI) scores (P < .001). Faculty rank was also associated with LOR. The resident impression of interviewees was associated with faculty interview scores (P = 0.001) and faculty rank (P < .001).

The study concludes with traditional in…

### Improving longitudinal survey participation among internal medicine residents: Incorporating behavioral economic techniques and avoiding Friday or Saturday invitations [^114xNYbB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Low participation rates limit the generalizability of surveys. Prior studies show participation is better with financial incentives. Beyond financial incentives, insights from behavioral economics reveal that psychological concepts, like regret aversion, can increase participation. For example, subsequent medication adherence improves when patients are entered into a "regret lottery" — they can win prizes if they adhere or are told how much they could have won, had they adhered. Other studies of survey participation have compared response rates for some, but not all, days of the week. Using a longitudinal survey of internal medicine residents, we examined the effect of (a) whether the prize and regret message components of a regret lottery increased subsequent participation and (b) whether response rates varied based on the day of the week survey invitations were sent.

### C-SATS: Assessing surgical skills among urology residency applicants [^113MjNV4]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that surgical skills assessment could aid in the selection process of medical student applicants to a surgical program. Recently, crowdsourcing has been shown to provide an accurate assessment of surgical skills at all levels of training. We compared expert and crowd assessment of surgical tasks performed by resident applicants during their interview day at the urology program at the University of California, Irvine.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-five resident interviewees performed four tasks: open square knot tying, laparoscopic peg transfer, robotic suturing, and skill task 8 on the LAP Mentor™ (Simbionix Ltd, Lod, Israel). Faculty experts and crowd workers (Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skills [C-SATS], Seattle, WA) assessed recorded performances using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS), and the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) validated assessment tools.

- **Results**: Overall, 3938 crowd assessments were obtained for the four tasks in less than 3.5 hours, whereas the average time to receive 150 expert assessments was 22 days. Inter-rater agreement between expert and crowd assessment scores was 0.62 for open knot tying, 0.92 for laparoscopic peg transfer, and 0.86 for robotic suturing. Agreement between applicant rank on skill task 8 on the LAP Mentor assessment and crowd assessment was 0.32. The crowd match rank based solely on skills performance did not compare well with the final faculty match rank list (0.46).

### Gender bias in resident assessment in graduate medical education: Review of the literature [^116mjHHn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Competency-based medical education relies on meaningful resident assessment. Implicit gender bias represents a potential threat to the integrity of resident assessment. We sought to examine the available evidence of the potential for and impact of gender bias in resident assessment in graduate medical education.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was performed to evaluate the presence and influence of gender bias on resident assessment. We searched Medline and Embase databases to capture relevant articles using a tiered strategy. The review was conducted by two independent, blinded reviewers. We included studies with the primary objective of examining the impact of gender on resident assessment in graduate medical education in the United States or Canada, published from 1998 to 2018.

- **Results**: Nine studies examined the existence and influence of gender bias in resident assessment, and data included rating scores and qualitative comments. Heterogeneity in tools, outcome measures, and methodological approach precluded meta-analysis. Five of the nine studies reported a difference in outcomes attributed to gender, including gender-based differences in traits ascribed to residents, consistency of feedback, and performance measures.

- **Conclusion**: Our review suggests that gender bias poses a potential threat to the integrity of resident assessment in graduate medical education. Future study is warranted to understand how gender bias manifests in resident assessment, its impact on learners, and approaches to mitigate this bias.

### 52 precepts that medical trainees and physicians should consider regularly [^116Z2xgJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Being a physician is rewarding but also challenging in the complex health care system. As physicians, we are continually trying to deliver more effective and higher quality care to our patients. With improvement in mind, a list of precepts has been generated as a tool to remind all of us in clinical medicine about the exemplary characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes that are expected as the norm in this profession. The list is organized into four categories:

- **Promotion of relationships with patients**: The principles of the effective clinician are emphasized to ensure that patients receive the highest quality of care.
- **Growth and improvement**: These principles encourage continuous personal and professional development.
- **Values to guide one's career in medicine**: Fostering values helps guide physicians throughout their careers.

The list is envisioned as an instrument that may be helpful to medical learners and physicians by promoting reflection about ways to consistently perform at a high level while more fully appreciating the joy of practicing medicine. The list of precepts may also be useful to medical educators who wish to successfully mold the physicians of tomorrow.

### Debt of family medicine residents continues to grow [^1121eL9x]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of family medicine residents with $250,000 or more in self-reported educational debt rose from 26% in 2014 to 47% in 2019. This rapid rise in high indebtedness is concerning, given known associations with resident distress. Previous research has also shown that highly indebted residents are less likely to choose academics, geriatrics, and service-oriented career paths.

### Education and training satisfaction among radiology residents: Insights from a national survey [^116MfQsc]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

This national survey evaluates the perspectives and satisfaction of radiology residents in Greece regarding their educational program, aiming to enhance training at a national level and provide insights applicable to residency programs internationally.

- **Materials and methods**: A 77-question online survey was distributed to all registered radiology residents, collecting data on demographics and several topics, including working conditions, academic engagement, satisfaction with training, and subspecialty preferences. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Spearman's correlation test.

- **Results**: The survey achieved a response rate of 46.3% (166/358). While 83% of respondents expressed satisfaction with their choice of radiology as a specialty, 67% were not satisfied with their training program's overall quality. Key areas of dissatisfaction included inadequate working conditions (62%), limited access to structured curricula (45%), and insufficient academic research opportunities, with 95% lacking protected academic time. Subspecialty training interest in interventional radiology (IR) was rated as the most popular, with 22% showing interest in pursuing it over other options. Training in classical radiology, mammography, and MRI received low satisfaction scores. Most respondents supported reforms, including the use of a logbook, standardizing the curriculum, establishing a more equitable examination process, and extending the residency duration.

- **Conclusion**: This survey highlights the state of radiology residency programs in Greece, revealing significant areas for improvement and advocacy for systemic changes to advance educational outcomes.

### Impact of a 360-degree professionalism assessment on faculty comfort and skills in feedback delivery [^112JByBW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Professionalism is identified as a competency of resident education. The best approaches to teaching and evaluating professionalism are unknown, but feedback about professionalism is necessary to change practice and behavior. Faculty discomfort with professionalism may limit their delivery of feedback to residents.

- **Objectives**: A pilot program to implement a 360-degree evaluation of observable professionalism behaviors and determine how its use impacts faculty feedback to residents.

- **Design**: Internal Medicine (IM) residents were evaluated during ambulatory rotations using a 360-degree assessment of professional behaviors developed by the National Board of Medical Examiners(R). Faculty used evaluation results to provide individual feedback to residents.

- **Patients/participants**: Fifteen faculty members.

- **Measurements and main results**: Faculty completed pre- and post-intervention surveys. Using a 7-point Likert scale, faculty reported increased skill in giving general feedback (4.85 vs 4.36, p < .05) and feedback about professionalism (4.71 vs 3.57, p < .01) after the implementation of the 360-degree evaluation. They reported increased comfort in giving feedback about professionalism (5.07 vs 4.35, p < .05) but not about giving feedback in general (5.43 vs 5.50).

- **Conclusions**: A 360-degree professionalism evaluation instrument used to guide feedback to residents improves faculty comfort and self-assessed skill in giving feedback about professionalism.

### Factors associated with interest in pursuing a fourth year of family medicine residency training [^113sqSze]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The optimal length of residency training in family medicine, as with emergency medicine, is an ongoing debate due to several factors, but perceptions of graduating residents are missing from this debate.

- **Methods**: We used data from 3,054 family medicine residents who registered for the American Board of Family Medicine certification examination in 2014. A practice demographic questionnaire was a mandatory component of registration. The survey included the question, "If another year of training were available in your residency program, how likely would you be to pursue that?" We examined several factors potentially associated with interest in additional training.

- **Results**: The sample was predominantly female (53.9%), white (65.7%), and non-Hispanic (91.7%), with a mean age of 32.5 years. Overall, 52.8% of respondents reported being not at all likely to pursue additional training if available, 26.4% reported being somewhat likely, and 21.4% reported being moderately or extremely likely to do so. Male respondents were more likely than females to express no interest in an additional year of training (57.7% versus 48.1%). As educational debt increased, the likelihood of interest in additional training decreased. Anticipated practice settings, planned scope of practice, and intention to perform specific procedures also influenced interest in pursuing additional training.

- **Conclusion**: Slightly less than half of graduating family medicine residents expressed interest in a fourth year of training. Interest in a fourth year was associated with several characteristics.

### The infant and toddler curiosity questionnaire: A validated caregiver-report measure of curiosity in children from 5 to 24 months [^1135M12A]. Infancy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Study 3: Criterion validity**: Another source of validity evidence is the measure's relationship to other variables. This includes correlating them with scores of other existing measures with well-known characteristics. Therefore, we decided to compare the new scale to facets of temperament as we would expect them to be related yet distinct. While the temperament scales mostly capture how the child typically reacts to certain situations, the ITCQ mostly captures infant-initiated exploratory behaviors. As behavioral expressions may well be affected by how the child reacts to certain situations, we expected the temperamental facets to differentially correlate with the curiosity scores. Furthermore, it had previously been stated that an established relation between a curiosity measure and temperament would support the notion of it capturing curiosity as a trait.

Temperament is viewed as an early equivalent to adult personality traits, and its measures (Infant Behavior Questionnaire or IBQ; Early Child Behavior Questionnaire or ECBQ) have been shown to be reliable, valid, and informative both in personality-related research and for predicting behavioral outcomes. This makes them appropriate measures for exploring the ITCQ's criterion validity. In adults, positive accounts of curiosity similar to our conceptualization (e.g. Interest-Type Epistemic Curiosity, CEI Exploration Subscale) have been linked to higher Extraversion and Conscientiousness as well.

### Clinician-teachers' self-assessments versus learners' perceptions [^112QrfFV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Understanding how clinician-teachers' self-assessments compare to learners' impressions can help educators place these evaluations in the appropriate context. Past participants of the Johns Hopkins Faculty Development Program and other physician-teachers were surveyed in 2002 regarding their teaching skills and behaviors. We surveyed their learners to compare teacher and learner assessments of teaching proficiency, behaviors, enjoyment, and career satisfaction. In each area, learners' ratings were statistically significantly higher than their teachers' self-ratings. Though it is unclear whether teachers' or learners' assessments are a more accurate reflection of the truth, the more positive learner ratings should promote self-confidence in clinician-educators regarding their teaching abilities.

### Curiosity and critical thinking: Identifying child abuse before it is too late [^112XUcUn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

We reviewed medical records to identify factors contributing to not recognizing child abuse in cases where it was subsequently identified.

- **Design/methods**: Eighteen cases of delayed diagnosis of physical abuse were reviewed for qualitative themes. Missed abuse was defined by prior medical encounters that revealed findings concerning for physical abuse that were not recognized.

- **Results**: Clinical limitations contributing to a delay in diagnosis included inattention to skin and subconjunctival findings, acceptance of inadequate explanations for injuries, no history obtained from verbal children, insufficient exploration of signs and symptoms, nonadherence to the maltreatment pathway, and incorrect diagnoses from radiologic examinations. System-based limitations included limited medical record access or completeness and admission to less-than-optimal settings.

- **Conclusions**: Having a greater index of suspicion for abuse may mitigate missed opportunities. With variability of medical training in child abuse, the factors we identified can be used as learning objectives for continuing medical education.

### Developing a valid evaluation for interpersonal and communication skills [^115PU2wp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires that residency programs evaluate the acquisition of six general competencies, including interpersonal and communication skills (ICS). To develop a 360-degree method for this evaluation, a semantic-differentiation matrix for various communication traits was created for nurses to evaluate physician ICS. The authors aimed to determine whether this evaluation method could differentiate between more experienced medical communicators (faculty) and less experienced medical communicators (residents).

A 98-item questionnaire measured several communication dimensions using an eight-element semantic-differentiation scale. In addition, global assessment ratings were used to assess nursing perceptions of physician ICS skills. This process was repeated across various clinical scenarios.

There were 26 nurse evaluators, 19 emergency medicine (EM) residents (EM2 and EM3), and 30 EM faculty. Each physician received five independent evaluations, totaling 245 evaluations. All EM residents (EM2 and EM3) were compared with the EM faculty. All eight items on the semantic-differentiation scale were compared, as were the global assessment scores. In every category, the faculty scored higher (Mann-Whitney U: p < 0.001).

The evaluation process, integrating a semantic-differentiation matrix and global assessment items, demonstrated discriminatory results. Faculty physicians scored significantly higher than resident physicians.

### The acceptability of the multiple mini interview for resident selection [^115zuHTF]. Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This study describes and assesses the acceptability of the multiple mini interview (MMI) to both international medical graduate (IMG) applicants to family medicine residency training in Alberta, Canada, and also interviewers for Alberta's International Medical Graduate Program (AIMGP), an Alberta Health and Wellness government initiative designed to help integrate IMGs into Canadian residency training. IMGs are physicians who completed undergraduate medical education outside of Canada and the United States. IMGs who live in the Canadian province of Alberta may obtain a limited number of government-funded positions for residency training by applying to AIMGP.

- **Methods**: A literature review and faculty and medical community consultation informed the development of a 12-station MMI designed to identify non-cognitive characteristics associated with professionalism potential. Clinical scenarios were developed by family physicians and medical educators. Applicant and interviewer posttest acceptability was assessed using surveys. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis and thematic description.

- **Results**: Our research demonstrates evidence for applicant and interviewer acceptability of the MMI. Interviewers reported high levels of satisfaction with the time-restricted process that addressed multiple situations pertinent to the Canadian family medicine context. Applicants and interviewers were each satisfied that 8 minutes was enough time at each station.

### Improving faculty feedback to resident trainees during a simulated case: a randomized, controlled trial of an educational intervention [^113e9G7i]. Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

Although feedback conversations are an essential component of learning, three challenges make them difficult: the fear that direct task feedback will harm the relationship with the learner, overcoming faculty cognitive biases that interfere with their eliciting the frames that drive trainees' performances, and time pressure. Decades of research on developmental conversations suggest solutions to these challenges: hold generous inferences about learners, subject one's own thinking to test by making it public, and inquire directly about learners' cognitive frames.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether a 1-hour educational intervention for anesthesia faculty improved feedback quality in a simulated case. The primary outcome was an analysis of the feedback conversation between faculty and a simulated resident (actor) by using averages of six elements of a Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale and an objective structured assessment of feedback. Seventy-one Harvard faculty anesthesiologists from five academic hospitals participated.

- **Results**: The intervention group scored higher when averaging all ratings. Scores for individual elements showed that the intervention group performed better in maintaining a psychologically safe environment (4.3 ± 1.21 vs. 3.8 ± 1.16; P = 0.001) and identifying and exploring performance gaps (4.1 ± 1.38 vs. 3.7 ± 1.34; P = 0.048). They more frequently emphasized the professionalism error of failing to call for help over the clinical topic of anaphylaxis (66% vs. 41%; P = 0.008).

- **Conclusions**: The qualit

### Ophthalmology resident selection: Current trends in selection criteria and improving the process [^115jG27v]. Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

To document and assess ophthalmology resident selection practices and initiate a discussion on how best to improve the process, an online survey comprising 56 questions was conducted.

Participants included program directors, chairpersons, or members of resident selection committees representing 65 United States ophthalmology residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education. The study participants completed an online, anonymous survey consisting primarily of multiple-choice questions with single or multiple answers.

- **Main outcome measures**: Ophthalmology resident selection practices were evaluated, including application screening, interview processes, selection factors, and the formation of rank lists. Recommendations were given to applicants and respondent satisfaction with the selection process was assessed.

Results indicated that as a group, survey respondents deemed the following factors most important in resident selection: interview performance (95.4%), clinical course grades (93.9%), letters of recommendation (83.1%), and board scores (80%). Statistical analyses determined that the best predictors of resident performance are interviews, clinical course grades, recommendation letters, and ophthalmology rotation performance.

In conclusion, ophthalmology resident selection is a relatively subjective process, continuing to rely heavily on cognitive factors. Because these factors are not always indicative of ultimate resident quality, it would be beneficial if ophthalmology training programs improved selection practices to more accurately discern the best candidates.

### Understanding and addressing varying perceptions of autonomy [^111ydLE4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

In scenarios where faculty and resident interaction has been limited for fair assessments of the individual's character and skill sets, consulting with senior residents or colleagues could meaningfully enhance attending-resident familiarity and break certain biases. Regular meetings and discussions with more senior residents or other faculty members to discuss the skills, medical knowledge, and clinical ability of the residents can be very helpful. This approach aids attendings with limited interaction with certain residents in forming a more accurate and fair opinion, which could help in providing the appropriate level of autonomy.

A positive influencer of entrustment for resident operative autonomy is shared personality traits between residents and attendings. One study described two broad personality categories of surgeons in the operating room: an individual's perception of goal attainment via a "promotion-oriented" or a "prevention-oriented" personality. Promotion-oriented individuals are risk-takers, open to new opportunities, plan for best-case scenarios, work quickly, and have a "playing-to-win" mentality. Meanwhile, prevention-oriented individuals are meticulous, often risk-averse, plan for the worst, stick with tried-and-true methods, and are described as "playing-not-to-lose". When both resident and faculty share the same personality traits in the operating room, it improves team dynamics, and by affirming each other's actions during surgical cases, it leads to the greatest opportunity for operative trust and autonomy.

### Humans monitor learning progress in curiosity-driven exploration [^116Eapum]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Strategies that prioritize high versus intermediate difficulty activities may have different computational bases and ecological roles. A preference for high-difficulty tasks may emerge from computational architectures that assign intrinsic utility to prediction errors or uncertainty, thus motivating agents to venture beyond familiar activities. In contrast, a strategy prioritizing activities with intermediate difficulty may emerge from control architectures based on learning progress (LP) that monitor the temporal derivative of performance — for example, percent correct (PC) — and generate intrinsic rewards for activities in which the agent's performance changes with practice.

LP-based algorithms are particularly important in naturalistic environments because they allow agents to avoid not only highly familiar tasks but also unlearnable tasks; that is, activities that are intrinsically random or cannot be mastered with the learner's knowledge or skills. Unlike PC-based algorithms that steer agents toward tasks of maximum difficulty, LP-based algorithms help to avoid random or excessively difficult activities. Moreover, these algorithms provide realistic solutions for optimizing study time allocation by maximizing the progress that an agent experiences in practice without precise knowledge of one's future learning curve. They have been applied to automate curriculum learning in difficult machine learning problems and personalize sequences of learning activities in educational technologies.

Despite the potential importance of LP-based control strategies, there is no empirical evidence supporting their efficacy in humans.

### Validation of an informatics tool to assess resident's progress in developing reporting skills [^1149pddE]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on competencies within international residency programs, rather than just education inputs. Traditionally, educational curricula have been based on "knowledge", providing a list of topics the trainee is expected to learn. However, the concepts of skills, competencies, and attitudes are more challenging to appreciate and assess.

The most important background in this field is provided by the concepts of competencies, milestones, and entrustable professional activities (EPA). Competencies refer to the aptitude or suitability to do something or intervene in a certain matter. For example, in the United States, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) currently defines six core competencies: patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice. Each is made up of sub-competencies, and each sub-competency is associated with milestones or goals that residents are required to achieve to master the stages of their medical training. In this system, the milestones are usually specialty-specific.

An EPA is a unit of work or responsibility that attending physicians entrust to the trainee to perform independently once sufficient competency has been demonstrated. This is used as a basis for decisions related to transitioning from residency training to clinical practice.

In their work, Deitte et al. attempted to establish a framework for assessment.

### Comparison of the perspectives of medical students and residents on the surgery learning environment [^114fCr9y]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Low credibility.

The learning environment plays a critical role in learners' satisfaction and outcomes. However, we often lack insight into learners' perceptions and assessments of these environments. It can be difficult to discern learners' expectations, making their input critical. When medical students and surgery residents are asked to evaluate their teachers, what do they focus on?

- **Materials and methods**: Open-ended comments from medical students' evaluations of residents and attending surgeons and from residents' evaluations of attendings during the 2016–2017 academic year were analyzed. Content analysis was used, and codes derived from the data. A matrix of theme by learner role was created to distinguish differences between medical student and resident learners. Subthemes were grouped based on similarity into high-order themes.

- **Results**: Two overarching themes were creating a positive environment for learning by modeling professional behaviors and intentionally engaging learners in training and educational opportunities. Medical students and residents made similar comments for the subthemes of appropriate demeanor, tone and dialog, respect, effective direct instruction, feedback, debriefing, giving appropriate levels of autonomy, and their expectations as team members on a service. Differences existed in the subthemes of punctuality, using evidence, clinical knowledge, efficiency, direct interactions with patients, learning outcomes, and career decisions.

### Optimizing survey response rates in graduate medical education research studies [^1145kXsr]. Family Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Survey response rates of 70% or higher are needed if findings are to be considered generalizable. Unfortunately, survey studies of health professionals have declining response rates. We have conducted survey research with residents and residency directors for over 13 years. Here, we describe the strategies we used to obtain optimal response rates in residency training research collaboratives.

- **Methods**: We administered over 6,000 surveys between 2007 and 2019 to evaluate the Preparing the Personal Physician for Practice and Length of Training Pilot studies, both of which involved redesigning residency training. Survey recipients included program directors, clinic managers, residents, graduates, as well as supervising physicians and clinic staff members. We logged and analyzed survey administration efforts and approaches to optimize strategies.

- **Results**: Overall, we obtained response rates of 100% for program director surveys, 98% for resident surveys, 97% for continuity clinic surveys, 81% for graduate surveys, 48% for supervising physician surveys, and 43% for clinic staff surveys. Response rates were highest when the relationships between the evaluation team and survey recipients were closest. Strategies for optimizing response rates included (1) building relationships with all participants whenever possible, (2) sensitivity to survey timing and fatigue, and (3) using creative and persistent follow-up measures to encourage survey completion.

- **Conclusion**: High response rates are achievable; though they require an investment in time, resources, and ingenuity.

### Direct observation for assessing emergency medicine core competencies: Interpersonal skills [^116iNmCR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The American Board of Medical Specialties described six core competencies considered essential elements of medical practice: patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice. In response, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandated that all residency programs assess trainees for the newly defined core competencies. Despite the mandate for including these six competencies in residency training, neither a specific curriculum nor a method to assess the outlined objectives has been developed by the ACGME. Instead, it is up to individual residency programs to document how they plan to incorporate and assess the core competencies in their programs. This article describes the potential use of direct observation to assess resident performance in the interpersonal skills core competency.

### Anesthesiology milestones 1.0: Residents' learning trajectories and training outcomes [^111N3dfL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Low credibility.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires anesthesiology training programs to submit Milestones ratings for each resident every six months, starting in the 2014–2015 academic year. We aimed to understand how anesthesiology residents progress through the Milestones evaluations from residency entry to graduation.

- **Methods**: Anesthesiology Milestones 1.0 included 25 subcompetencies in six core competencies: patient care, medical knowledge, systems-based practice, practice-based learning & improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal & communication skills. Milestones data from all anesthesiology residency programs from July 2015 to June 2019 were used to: (1) assess the prevalence of straight-lining (i.e. percentage of residents who received the same rating for all 25 subcompetencies for each program per reporting period); (2) describe residents' progression trajectories in each subcompetency, including the baseline at six-month training, growth rate (i.e. rate increase every 12 months), and outcomes on graduation (i.e. percentage of residency graduates who received at least one Level 4 [target for graduation] or above subcompetency rating, and percentage of graduates who did not reach Level 4 for at least one subcompetency); and (3) use three-level linear mixed-effect models to examine individual resident growth in each subcompetency over time while accounting for clustering effect of residency programs.

- **Results**: The analyses included 11,691 residents from 153 training programs. Among 6,696 clinical anesthesia year 3 residents, 98.3% received level 4 or above ratings in at least one subcompetency by graduation.

### Radiation oncology resident evaluations: Current methods and resident perceptions [^114nwryF]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Currently, the literature on resident evaluation and perspectives primarily highlights experiences within surgical and medical specialties. Orthopedic surgery was among the first to collect data on the incorporation of milestones in evaluations and their effect on resident perceptions and performance. In a survey of faculty and program leaders, case minimums were perceived to be effective in monitoring the progress of residents and the quality of a program but were reported as suboptimal in adequately representing surgical skills. In contrast, internal and family medicine evaluations focus on the cultural and behavioral aspects of residents and the program as a whole.

This study adds to the limited data on US Radiation Oncology (RO) resident evaluation processes. The data presented on resident perspectives highlight the need to educate residents about standardized evaluation tools. A majority of the residents were "not" or only "slightly familiar" with the 6 Core Competencies and the factors used to assess them. Approximately 50% of residents report being intimidated and stressed by receiving evaluations. Despite low familiarity, residents are inclined to change their behavior in response to feedback, highlighting the value of evaluation methods in eliciting positive change. Increasing familiarity with the competencies and the factors involved in the evaluations would likely help mitigate the fear associated with receiving feedback and enhance behavior change. Although only approximately 50% of the residents were satisfied with the frequency and timeliness of feedback, more were satisfied with the feedback overall.

### The infant and toddler curiosity questionnaire: A validated caregiver-report measure of curiosity in children from 5 to 24 months [^113NXkWS]. Infancy (2025). Low credibility.

Figure 3 shows mean score density plots for overall curiosity as well as the subscale scores.

Multiple linear regressions indicated that age (b = 0.04, p < 0.001) predicted curiosity scores, while neither sex (b = 0.06, p = 0.305) nor socioeconomic status (SES) (b = −0.02, p = 0.453) did (F (3, 324) = 18.05, p < 0.001). Unexpectedly, age was a significant predictor, prompting an exploratory investigation into these relations for each subscale. This analysis revealed the age effect was mainly driven by the Interactive subscale scores (b = 0.10, p < 0.001, F (3, 321) = 38.02, p < 0.001), somewhat smaller for the Investigative subscale scores (b = 0.07, p < 0.001, F (3, 322) = 20.93, p < 0.001), and non-significant for the Sensory subscale scores (b = 0.01, p = 0.092, F (3, 324) = 2.03, p = 0.120). Additionally, the age effect on mean scores disappeared from the age of 13 months (b = 0.02, p = 0.087). These subscale patterns align with those for item difficulties and the proportion of NA responses (Table 1), the latter of which significantly decreased with age (b = −0.31, p < 0.001) and stabilized around the age of 14 months (b = −0.03, p = 0.066).

Lastly, the overall mean scores and the two curiosity items were positively correlated (direct item: r = 0.36, p < 0.001; comparative item: r = 0.21, p < 0.001), offering an initial indication of construct validity. It is important to note, however, that these single items are not validated measures themselves and therefore cannot reliably capture differences in curiosity, with the median value for the direct item being 7 out of 7.

### "The forest and the trees": A narrative medicine curriculum by residents for residents [^11178mt6]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Participants highlighted the impact that sharing can have, not only in building stronger bonds as a cohort but also in soothing professional anxieties about how they should or should not be experiencing residency.

Residents described how workshops facilitated a sense of communion between themselves and patients by encouraging them to step back from their perspectives as trainees and instead consider the family in front of them. One PGY2 expressed:

You think about what you're treating and about what you're managing when you enter the room. But then, it is great to have that perspective of sometimes just going into the room and seeing like, "wow, this is a family. I see these toys here". I can think about what that family unit is just outside of the hospital and how I can help them get back to that.

In this sense, workshops served as a pause for residents to remember their purpose as caregivers and prioritize their patient's humanity before focusing on medical decision-making. Another resident expressed that finding that pause allowed for recognizing the beauty of the clinical encounter: "So many beautiful things that happen in these patient encounters that… you don't always get to appreciate when you're in the weeds. But it pulls you back to see the forest and the trees".

Residents also reflected on how centering the patient perspective and engaging in literature led to tangible changes in their clinical practice. One PGY3 alluded to a story from one workshop which was written from a patient's perspective.

### Understanding and addressing varying perceptions of autonomy [^116gpyh7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Increased faculty exposure to diversity is one strategy to decrease bias in resident evaluation and increase their surgical autonomy. However, there are other potential ways to decrease bias in resident evaluations. In addition to entrustment allowing increased resident autonomy, the data also suggests it decreases bias. This was described in Sandhu and colleagues' exploration of attending and resident entrustment behaviors in the operating room. It is essential to have detailed protocols within the training program that guide the faculty in a stepwise manner on how to take the initiative and prompt the residents to show their skills, review the surgical plan, and be more involved in the case. The more the resident can be involved and comfortable participating in the case, the more the attending will get to know the resident, decreasing their possible prior biases.

Additionally, attendings should meet more frequently to review residents and compare their reviews with other colleagues. If substantial differences are present in evaluations, they need to discuss why they are different and assess what potential biases led to diverging conclusions. Overall, increased diversity, more familiarity between attendings and residents, and more frequent collaboration between faculty in resident evaluations will help decrease bias towards surgical residents.

### Core entrustable professional activities for entering residency: A national survey of graduating medical students' self-assessed skills by specialty [^116WHP3A]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

As the undergraduate medical education (UME) and graduate medical education (GME) communities work toward more effective and safe transitions to residency, understanding differences in preparedness for residency training in relation to the intended specialty is an integral first step in addressing training gaps. Although studies have investigated learners' preparedness for residency training from the perspectives of the learner, medical school, and residency program, few have focused on specialty-specific aspects of preparedness. Given the heterogeneous nature of educational experiences during the final ("fourth") year of medical school, during which students can tailor much of their curriculum depending on their intended specialty, students may be differentially prepared to perform Core EPA tasks based on their planned specialty.

Medical students generally seek the advice and direction of program directors in their chosen specialty regarding how to optimally prepare for the start of residency training in that specialty. In the context of recommending readiness for entrustment in all 13 Core EPAs for their entering PGY-1 residents among surgery program directors, we hypothesized that students' self-assessed skills in the Core EPAs would differ at graduation based on specialty. Specifically, students planning to enter surgery might self-assess their skills in the Core EPAs more highly than students planning to enter various other specialties. To examine the relationship between intended specialty and self-assessed skills in the Core EPAs, we used national-level data.

### A spirituality and medicine elective for senior medical students: 4 years' experience, evaluation, and expansion to the family medicine residency [^111pM2jb]. Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that spirituality is important in patient care and medical education, yet there are few reports of spirituality and medicine curricular evaluation.

- **Methods**: We developed, implemented, and evaluated a 17-hour elective on spirituality and patient care for four consecutive years. We presented the elective to 10 fourth-year medical students (MS4s) in years one and two and to eight MS4s and 15 residents, faculty, and staff in years three and four. We evaluated knowledge and skills using pre-course and post-course questionnaires and written cases and learner satisfaction using course evaluations.

- **Results**: Students' knowledge improved on the evidence about spirituality, clinical resources, the role of chaplains, approaches to patient care, and recognizing spiritual distress. Reported course strengths included diversity of topics and instructors, universal principles, small-group format, case discussions, and opportunity for self-reflection. Comments reflected enhanced value in the "meaning in medicine" and "whole person care".

- **Conclusions**: Senior medical students rated the elective positively and increased their knowledge of spirituality and medicine. It was also positively received by residents, faculty, and staff and paved the way for residency curricula in this subject.
