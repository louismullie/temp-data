## Question

Capsaicin uses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about capsaicin's therapeutic uses across formulations and indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to stratify by formulation and route because concentration and delivery drive indication and effect size. Then, I should separate approved or guideline-backed uses from off-label or investigational applications and explicitly flag rejected uses. Next, I will review key efficacy data for neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, pruritus, and rhinitis, followed by safety, mechanism, and practical pearls. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical hierarchy of use while double-checking regulatory nuances so I do not overstate approvals, especially across regions.

> Let me first confirm the major formulations and routes because dosing and delivery determine where capsaicin fits. Low-concentration topicals (about 0.0125–0.25%) are applied multiple times daily for musculoskeletal and some neuropathic pain, with the FDA Structured Product Label listing 0.025% every 6–8 hours for osteoarthritis symptoms in adults, which anchors pragmatic dosing for creams and gels [^111C33vM]. High-concentration 8% patches (Qutenza) are clinic-applied for 30–90 minutes to defined areas to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, avoiding daily self-application and providing weeks of benefit in trials and practice reviews, which I should keep in mind when I weigh adherence and durability [^113GFono]. Additional routes include intraarticular trans‑capsaicin injections under study for knee osteoarthritis and intranasal preparations explored for non-allergic rhinitis, so I need to keep those separate as investigational versus guideline-endorsed uses [^114mcCcs] [^111qL8iu].

> I will now examine peripheral neuropathic pain, starting with postherpetic neuralgia, because this is where the 8% patch has the most consistent guideline and RCT support. The AAFP recommends offering the capsaicin 8% patch for PHN with single 30–90 minute applications, and EFNS guidelines endorse capsaicin patches for PHN, noting that long-term sensory effects with repeats were not fully clarified at the time of publication, so I should communicate duration and retreatment expectations carefully [^113GFono] [^115oE49C]. Large randomized studies, including the Lancet Neurology trial and a confirmatory phase 3 study, demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in pain over 12 weeks after a single 60‑minute application, corroborated by a pooled analysis across PHN studies favoring Qutenza over low-dose control, which strengthens the evidence base here [^1171GZMy] [^117TV6kJ] [^115jxMLs].

> Hold on, I should verify the scope of evidence in HIV-associated neuropathy because regional labeling differs. EU approval covers the 8% patch for peripheral neuropathic pain in nondiabetic adults based on phase 3 trials in PHN and HIV‑associated neuropathy, with durable responses up to about 12 weeks and efficacy on retreatment, so there is strong support internationally for HIV‑AN even if local labeling may differ [^115oE49C]. Meta-analytic data likewise demonstrate superiority of the 8% patch over control in HIV‑AN cohorts, aligning mechanism and clinical effect across etiologies of peripheral neuropathic pain [^115jxMLs].

> Next, I should review diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and I need to ensure I do not conflate EU licensing constraints with guideline recommendations. The AAFP 2024 guideline recommends topical capsaicin as a second‑line option for painful DPN, typically alongside topical lidocaine, which gives clinicians a role for topical therapy when systemic agents are limited or poorly tolerated [^111Zn41Z]. But wait, I should double‑check the EU stance: in the EU, the capsaicin 8% patch is not licensed for diabetic patients due to insufficient data, which means that while guidelines may support use, regional labeling may exclude DPN, and this distinction should be explicitly discussed with patients and within formularies [^115oE49C]. If I recall earlier, I almost said "EU includes diabetics", but that would have been incorrect; the EU label explicitly excludes diabetics, so I'm correcting that now to avoid misinterpretation [^115oE49C].

> Let me consider osteoarthritis next, separating topical creams from intraarticular approaches. For symptomatic OA pain, low-concentration creams have modest efficacy compared with placebo and appear roughly equivalent to topical NSAIDs in network meta-analysis when used at licensed doses, which suggests a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot use NSAIDs or prefer a non-systemic topical [^1119rpsm]. The FDA SPL lists a practical adult OA dose of 0.025% applied every 6–8 hours, which again underscores frequent application and local tolerability counseling for patients [^111C33vM]. Intraarticular trans‑capsaicin (CNTX-4975) produced dose‑dependent reductions in knee OA pain through 24 weeks in a phase II RCT, but I should caution that this remains investigational and trial alpha was set at 0.10, so larger confirmatory studies are warranted before routine clinical adoption [^114mcCcs].

> I need to check chronic pruritus because dermatology guidelines nuance localized versus generalized itch. The European S2k guideline recommends considering topical capsaicin for localized chronic pruritus, which is consistent with the pathophysiology of focal hyperinnervation and TRPV1‑mediated dysesthesia [^112cDbud]. Conversely, the British Association of Dermatologists recommends against topical capsaicin in generalized pruritus of unknown origin, so I should avoid broad application in diffuse itch and confine use to well-demarcated focal conditions such as pruritus ani when appropriate [^114Yoagz] [^116YvGNz].

> Now, I will review intranasal uses for non-allergic rhinitis, keeping an eye on evidence quality. Cochrane synthesis and a subsequent scoping review report improvement in symptom burden and acceptable safety with intranasal capsaicin in non-allergic rhinitis, although products and regimens vary and this remains off‑label in many jurisdictions, so shared decision-making and specialist involvement are prudent [^111qL8iu] [^111LwRY7].

> Let me not overlook low back pain recommendations. The NASS 2020 guideline permits short‑term use of topical capsicum for up to three months in low back pain, which offers a non‑systemic adjunct for patients in whom standard analgesics or physical therapy alone are insufficient, but I should frame this as time‑limited and symptom‑focused rather than disease‑modifying [^115e2c9Y].

> I should double-check the literature for chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain because burning sensations complicate blinding and can bias results. A surgical pain systematic review found no benefit from a single 60‑minute 8% patch application at three months in one trial, while two small trials of 0.075% cream four times daily for 6–8 weeks suggested modest benefit with notable local reactions and risk of bias due to blinding challenges, so expectations should be conservative and individual trials scrutinized [^114pDcTB].

> But wait, what about other neuropathic etiologies like chemotherapy‑induced peripheral neuropathy. The German Society for Neurology guideline cited in an oncology‑supportive care review recommends the capsaicin 179 mg patch as a second‑line option for neuropathic pain of any origin, including CIPN, although high‑quality RCT data in CIPN remain limited, so use should be individualized and ideally coordinated with oncology and neurology teams [^113rfGEJ].

> I will now examine burning mouth syndrome, acknowledging heterogeneity and tolerability considerations. A systematic review suggests that topical capsaicin rinses can desensitize pain for up to several months in BMS, with increased TRPV1 expression in oral mucosa as a rationale, yet long‑term safety data for repeated oral mucosa exposure are limited and gastric adverse effects constrain systemic capsaicin, so topical rinses are the preferred experimental approach when used [^113wRg1F].

> Next, I should review conditions where capsaicin is not recommended or the evidence is insufficient. The EADV 2022 guideline recommends against capsaicin cream for vulvodynia, so I should not offer it in that setting outside of research protocols [^114s2DYf]. For cluster headache prevention, the American Headache Society guideline states evidence is insufficient for 0.025% cream to reduce attack frequency, aligning with a general lack of robust data for craniofacial headache indications [^111qcYQ5]. As noted earlier, topical capsaicin is also not recommended for generalized pruritus of unknown origin by BAD, reinforcing the need to target localized disease [^114Yoagz].

> Let me think about mechanism to connect clinical effects with expected time course. The analgesic effect stems from TRPV1 agonism leading to nociceptor defunctionalization, with reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fiber terminals, temporary loss of membrane potential, and reduced neuropeptide release, which supersedes older "substance P depletion" explanations and aligns with observed weeks‑long benefit after a single high‑dose exposure [^116VFphH] [^117FM3mB]. In vivo human data show that after high‑concentration topical application, cutaneous vascular reflexes and markers of peptidergic nociceptor function can recover or even improve as pain diminishes over weeks, suggesting regeneration accompanies clinical response in a subset of patients [^1119Drwj].

> Hold on, I should verify systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics because this affects safety and drug interaction counseling. Capsaicin has minimal systemic absorption from topical use, with very low plasma levels after 8% patch application and rapid elimination after oral exposure, supporting a predominantly local mechanism and a low likelihood of systemic adverse effects or interactions, which is clinically reassuring when treating polypharmacy patients [^113UvSyf].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability across formulations. The most common reactions are application‑site pain, burning, and erythema, with other common events including pruritus, rash, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and transient blood pressure elevations associated with application discomfort, which I should anticipate and manage proactively in clinic [^1164DyRt] [^113tZMt8] [^111mWej5]. Rare or unknown‑frequency events include cough, dysesthesia, eye irritation, sneezing, and blistering, underscoring the importance of avoiding mucosal or ocular exposure and using cleansing gel after patch removal to limit spread [^115gDVWM] [^111PEyXH].

> Let me consider practical pearls and self-correct where needed. For the 8% patch, pretreatment with topical anesthetic and local cooling improves tolerability during application, and mapping the painful area with sensory testing helps right‑size the patch and optimize coverage, which can improve outcomes and patient experience [^111PEyXH]. Repeat applications may be required because some patients are slower responders; post hoc analyses suggest two or even three treatments at intervals of eight weeks or more may be needed before concluding nonresponse, so I should set expectations and schedule reassessment accordingly [^114HMMjd] [^112WZ4a7]. Earlier I referred to "FDA off‑label indication" for OA, which is imprecise; to be clear, the SPL provides dosing language for symptomatic OA relief with low‑dose creams, whereas regional approvals for the 8% patch focus on peripheral neuropathic pain, and I should not conflate these categories when counseling patients [^111C33vM] [^116zRNPC].

> Finally, I should synthesize a clinical hierarchy to guide use. Strongly supported uses include PHN and HIV‑associated neuropathy for the 8% patch based on guideline endorsements and randomized trials, with practical durability of about 12 weeks and the option for retreatment when pain recurs or response wanes, which justifies prioritization in localized peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes [^113GFono] [^116GYKjW] [^1171GZMy]. Conditionally supported uses include DPN as a second‑line topical per primary care guidelines and localized chronic pruritus per dermatology guidance, with careful attention to local labeling constraints for diabetics in the EU and to focal disease selection in itch [^111Zn41Z] [^112cDbud] [^115oE49C]. For OA, low‑concentration creams offer modest benefit and may be roughly comparable to topical NSAIDs at licensed doses, while intraarticular trans‑capsaicin remains investigational pending larger trials, which I should explain when aligning options with patient preferences and contraindications [^1119rpsm] [^114mcCcs]. Non‑allergic rhinitis has supportive but heterogeneous evidence and remains off‑label in many settings, and low back pain use is short‑term only per NASS, whereas several conditions, including vulvodynia, cluster headache prevention, and generalized pruritus, are not recommended based on current guidelines, which helps avoid ineffective or potentially irritating applications [^111qL8iu] [^115e2c9Y] [^114s2DYf] [^111qcYQ5] [^114Yoagz].

### Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 activation enhances gut glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and improves glucose homeostasis [^1129ued4]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Activation of TRPV1 through chronic dietary capsaicin can enhance glucose tolerance. TRPV1 plays a pivotal role in regulating glucose homeostasis, although the results of its effects are inconsistent. This study investigated whether chronic dietary capsaicin affects glucose tolerance in wild-type (WT) and TRPV1 knockout (TRPV1 −/−) mice.

In WT mice, dietary capsaicin led to lower fasting glucose levels and improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) compared to WT mice without dietary capsaicin (Fig. 4A). However, in TRPV1 −/− mice, no changes were observed with or without dietary capsaicin (Fig. 4B). Body weight remained consistent among WT and TRPV1 −/− mice regardless of capsaicin intake. Further investigation revealed that a glucose challenge increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in WT mice with dietary capsaicin, whereas no increase was observed in TRPV1 −/− mice. Plasma GLP-1 levels and GLP-1 protein expression in the ileum were elevated in WT mice with chronic dietary capsaicin (Fig. 4C–E). The results suggest that the improvement in glucose tolerance due to chronic dietary capsaicin is associated with GLP-1 secretion mediated by TRPV1 activation.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^114DP5VK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of high-purity synthetic trans-capsaicin (CNTX-4975) in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA)-associated knee pain:

- **Methods**: In this phase II multicenter double-blind study, patients aged 45–80 years with stable knee OA were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive a single intraarticular injection of placebo, CNTX-4975 0.5 mg, or CNTX-4975 1.0 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in daily Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain with walking score (range 0–10, 0 = none and 10 = extreme) through week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included a similar AUC analysis of outcomes in patients treated with CNTX-4975 0.5 mg, and evaluations extending to 24 weeks.

- **Results**: Efficacy was evaluated in 172 patients (placebo group, n = 69; CNTX-4975 0.5 mg group, n = 33; CNTX-4975 1.0 mg group, n = 70). At week 12, greater decreases in the AUC for the pain score were observed with CNTX-4975 in the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg groups versus placebo (0.5 mg group least squares mean difference [LSMD] -0.79, P = 0.0740; 1.0 mg group LSMD -1.6, P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were maintained at week 24 in the 1.0 mg group (LSMD -1.4, P = 0.0002). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the placebo and CNTX-4975 1.0 mg groups.

In conclusion, CNTX-4975 provided dose-dependent improvement in knee OA-associated pain. CNTX-4975 1.0 mg produced a significant decrease in OA knee pain through 24 weeks.

### Capsaicin for non-allergic rhinitis [^111qL8iu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

There are many forms of rhinitis. Patients are diagnosed with non-allergic rhinitis when anatomic, infectious, and allergic aetiologies have been excluded. The symptoms, including nasal congestion, blockage or obstruction, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and, less frequently, nasal itching, can range from mild to debilitating. It affects between 25% and 50% of patients with rhinitis. Several medications are widely used in the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis, including oral and topical nasal antihistamines, intranasal and (rarely) systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers delivered intranasally, is considered a treatment option for non-allergic rhinitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of non-allergic rhinitis compared with no therapy, placebo, other topical or systemic medications, combinations of these therapies, or different capsaicin regimens.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials in adult patients with non-allergic rhinitis comparing intranasal capsaicin with no therapy, placebo, other topical or systemic medications, or their combinations.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^113UvSyf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that topical capsaicin works through a transdermal systemic delivery into tissues other than the skin. Capsaicin is a very lipophilic, non-water-soluble compound that resists diffusion into aqueous solutions such as blood, showing limited potential for transdermal delivery across human skin. Even when capsaicin is absorbed systemically, the duration of exposure is very short.

The oral bioavailability of capsaicin was recently reported in humans: after ingestion of 26.6 mg of capsaicin, the pharmacokinetic parameters were a C max of 2.5 (0.1) ng ml−1, T max of 47.1 (2.0) min, and T 1/2 of 24.9 (5.0) min. There are no published data from low-concentration formulations, but after 60 or 90 min capsaicin 8% patch treatments for painful peripheral neuropathy, plasma concentrations were also very low, with a population C max of 1.86 ng ml−1, and transient, with a mean elimination half-life of 1.64 h. The longer elimination half-life of topical capsaicin relative to oral exposure likely reflects its slow release from the skin at the patch application site.

Capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome (CYP) enzymes present in the human liver, but in vitro studies show that its metabolism in human skin is quite slow. The implication for topical capsaicin-containing analgesics is that capsaicin can reside at the site of action (i.e. skin) relatively unchanged, whereas any capsaicin that is transdermally absorbed is rapidly eliminated.

### Systematic review of management of chronic pain after surgery [^114pDcTB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Three trials including data from 174 participants evaluated capsaicin for relief of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair, mastectomy, and diverse procedures for cancer. All studies were at risk of bias because of issues relating to the blinding of a preparation with a burning sensation and erythema. One study was also at risk of bias owing to selective reporting.

The trial assessing a single 60-minute application of a capsaicin patch (8 percent) found no evidence of pain relief compared with placebo after 3 months. Two trials of low-dose (0.075 percent) capsaicin topical cream applied four times daily for 6–8 weeks reported some evidence of reduced pain intensity compared with placebo. Meta-analysis suggested a modest positive effect of capsaicin topical cream on the proportion of patients reporting pain improvement (odds ratio 2.64, 95 percent confidence interval 1.02 to 6.86; I² = 0 percent), although caution is warranted owing to risk of bias and, as a previous Cochrane review advised, the total number of events was too few to be reliable. In both trials, a commonly reported side-effect was a local skin reaction.

### Therapeutic applications of capsaicin in humans to target conditions of the respiratory system: A scoping review [^111LwRY7]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Various studies have explored potential therapeutic applications of capsaicin in human medicine, for example, in pain, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and chart available evidence on therapeutic applications of capsaicin in humans using any mode of capsaicin delivery to treat conditions of the respiratory system.

- **Methods**: Electronic bibliographic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus) were searched from inception to 2021 to identify experimental studies reporting clinical outcomes of therapeutic applications of capsaicin. Studies with or without control groups published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Animal studies, studies of human cell lines, and physiological proof of concept studies were excluded. Reviewer pairs independently double-screened 2,799 search results for inclusion.

- **Results**: Twenty-three original studies were included. Capsaicin has been investigated for the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis (n = 15), nasal polyposis (n = 3), allergic rhinitis (n = 2), unexplained chronic cough (n = 2), and prevention of aspiration pneumonia (n = 1). Modes of delivery included intranasal application (nasal spray, soaked pads, solution), inhalation, ingestion, and aural ointment. Seventeen studies reported positive effects of capsaicin on clinical outcomes for rhinitis, nasal polyposis, chronic cough, and pneumonia. Sixteen studies reported on the safety of capsaicin, with no reports of significant adverse events and overall fair to good patient acceptance.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^113wRg1F]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Capsaicin has been shown to be an effective pain desensitiser, particularly with oral topical application lasting up to four months. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors (TRPV1) are found in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The number of TRPV1 receptors is significantly increased in the mucosa of patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Activation of TRPV1 at the peripheral terminal fibre endings leads to the release of neuropeptides such as substance P, neurokinin A (NKA), and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), which contribute to the onset of hyperalgesia, pain, and inflammation.

Local capsaicin application activates TRPV1 and modulates the nociceptive transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral stimulation site to the CNS by blocking axonal transportation, depleting neuropeptides, and causing a loss of membrane action potential. Hence, the capsaicin-induced analgesic effect is achieved by desensitising the nociceptive fibre, a reversible process. The use of topical capsaicin has been suggested in neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic neuralgia and painful HIV-associated polyneuropathy, but not in inflammatory pain like osteoarthritis.

A study showed no difference between systemic and topical capsaicin efficacy in BMS. However, gastric pain limits the use of systemic capsaicin. The use of topical capsaicin rinse is recommended in BMS due to its rapid action and the absence of reported adverse effects as seen with other synthetic drugs. However, there are no known risks of long-term repeated use of capsaicin rinse, especially concerning oral cavity mucosa innervation.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^114mcCcs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Statistical analysis focused on determining an effect size of 0.45, which required a sample size of 157 evaluable patients (63 in each of the placebo and CNTX‐4975 1.0 mg groups, and 31 in the CNTX‐4975 0.5 mg group) to achieve 80% statistical power for a significant dose–placebo comparison using a two-sided test at a 10% significance level (prespecified alpha level, P ≤ 0.10). Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the planned enrollment initially included 173 patients, comprising 69 in each of the placebo and CNTX‐4975 1.0 mg groups, and 35 in the CNTX‐4975 0.5 mg group. All analyses were performed with a prespecified alpha level of 0.10, ensuring consistency with the method of sample size estimation and the study's power to detect a statistical difference in the primary endpoint, using corresponding 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs).

Demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety endpoints were evaluated in the safety population, which encompassed all patients who received any study medication. All efficacy endpoints were analyzed within the modified intent‐to‐treat population, including all randomized patients with at least one postbaseline efficacy assessment.

Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed via analysis of covariance, incorporating treatment as the main effect, along with sex, pooled site, baseline K/L grade, baseline BMI, and baseline WOMAC knee pain with walking score as covariates. AUCs for pain rating values were standardized to a 0–10 pain rating scale. The AUC was calculated using a time-weighted average, standardized by each patient's length of time in the study through week 12 or 24, contingent on the endpoint.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^113jdBvN]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Capsaicin, one of the primary constituents of the Capsicum species, is an active component of chili peppers. Capsicum is grown worldwide and adds color, pungency (i.e. heat), and aroma to food. Capsaicin is used orally, topically, and intranasally for a variety of conditions. It is most commonly used topically for musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neuralgias/neuropathies, back pain, fibromyalgia, and muscle spasms. In fact, both low-concentration over-the-counter (OTC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved, high-concentration (i.e. Qutenza™) topical formulations are available.

Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the effect of capsaicin with placebo, usual treatment, or other capsaicin products within a variety of populations, including those with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other MSK conditions. Capsaicin was delivered topically either as a patch or gel/cream; capsaicin gels/creams were labeled as Capsika gel®, Zostrix®, Dolarac™, Finalgon®, or Sensedol®. Daily dosages of patches containing either 0.1% or 22–37.4 µg/cm² of capsaicin were applied at times ranging from four to 12 hours over three to four weeks, whereas dosages of creams containing 0.0125–0.25% capsaicin were applied at times ranging from twice to four times daily for three to 12 weeks.

### Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 activation enhances gut glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and improves glucose homeostasis [^111ueixG]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Acute capsaicin administration through TRPV1 activation increases GLP-1 secretion in vivo.

Capsicum frutescens or dietary capsaicin has been shown to affect glucose homeostasis. It is unknown whether the acute effects of capsaicin on GLP-1 secretion can be detected in vivo by TRPV1 stimulation. We examined the effects of intragastric administration of capsaicin on the circulating levels of peptide YY (PYY), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon. Fasting mice were challenged with glucose (2 g/kg) and capsaicin (1 μmol/L). The plasma PYY, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon levels at 30 min were not different in wild-type (WT) mice with and without capsaicin administration. By contrast, administration of capsaicin or another TRPV1 agonist, RTX, increased GLP-1 secretion 30 min after glucose challenge, and this effect was inhibited by the TRPV1 antagonist iRTX in WT mice. However, the effect of increased GLP-1 secretion was absent in TRPV1 −/− mice. A similar effect of capsaicin on plasma insulin levels was observed. In the absence of glucose challenge, capsaicin also slightly increased the GLP-1 levels, although plasma GLP-1 level is much lower than in the presence of glucose challenge.

We next examined the TRPV1 action using the selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin (9–39). The plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased after intraperitoneal injection of exendin (9–39) (10 µg/mice) before glucose challenge. In addition, the effect of oral capsaicin on plasma levels of insulin was noted.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114ZRdMs]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, when used as licensed, are both superior to placebo for pain relief. No significant differences were identified in the level of pain relief offered by topical NSAIDs compared to capsaicin. However, limited and poor-quality evidence for capsaicin in osteoarthritis provides uncertainty. Displaying seemingly negligible differences in efficacy, the decision of whether to prescribe topical NSAIDs or capsaicin should be guided by patient preference, safety, costs, and subsequent individual patient response.

Focusing on licensed doses of these two drugs renders the results of this meta-analysis more relevant for clinicians, as they relate directly to the drugs recommended for prescription. The list of approved drugs was extracted from the BNF, a resource commonly used to guide prescribing practice in the UK. The BNF was chosen as the leading authority on clinicians' selection of medicines in the UK; however, it should be noted that they offer only recommendations of licensed medications, and physicians can prescribe medications outside the recommended list.

No direct or indirect (via NMA) quantitative evidence of the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs vs. capsaicin has been published previously. Some guidelines, such as those by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), provide equal recommendations for the two treatments. This may indicate a perceived equivalence in efficacy, in line with the findings of the meta-analysis.

### Topical capsaicin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^111iN9yb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions, including neuropathic pain. Following application to the skin, capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli, followed by a period of reduced sensitivity. After repeated applications, persistent desensitization can occur. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and tolerability of capsaicin for treating painful chronic neuropathies.

- **Objectives**: To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

- **Search strategy**: Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database were searched in May 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and validity and extracted data. Information was extracted on the number of participants with pain relief (clinical improvement) after at least six weeks and with local skin reactions. This information was used to calculate the relative risk and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH). Details of the definition of pain relief and specific adverse events were sought.

- **Main results**: Six studies (389 participants in total) compared regular application of low-dose (0.075%) capsaicin cream with placebo cream. The NNT for any pain relief over six to eight weeks was 6.6 (4.1 to 17). Two studies (709 participants in total) compared a single application.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^117TV6kJ]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to confirm the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of NGX-4010, an 8% capsaicin dermal patch (capsaicin 640 µg/cm²), in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is a chronic pain disorder that is difficult to treat, and treatment options are often limited by poor tolerability.

A total of 418 patients were randomized to receive a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 or a 0.04% capsaicin control patch (3.2 µg/cm²) in a multicenter, double-blind, confirmatory, phase 3 study. Patients were aged 18–90 years, had a diagnosis of PHN, pain for at least 6 months, and an average baseline Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of 3–9.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks 2–8. NGX-4010 recipients had a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline in pain during weeks 2–8 compared to the control group (32.0% vs. 24.4%; P = 0.011). A ≥ 30% reduction in mean NPRS scores was achieved in 46% of NGX-4010 recipients compared with 34% of controls (P = 0.02). Pain was significantly lower in NGX-4010 recipients than in controls by week 2, and greater pain reduction was maintained throughout the remaining 12-week study period. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were application site-specific (notably erythema and pain), transient, and generally mild to moderate in severity.

In conclusion, in patients with PHN, a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 produced significant reduction in pain that was maintained over a 12-week period.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^115oE49C]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) is an alternative treatment option for neuropathic pain (NP) that is designed to deliver a high dose of capsaicin topically where the pain is experienced. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, is an agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels, which play an important role in the transmission of pain signals. Continuous activation of TRPV1 causes nociceptor defunctionalization — accompanied by a reversible reduction in epidermal nerve fiber density — and an inhibition of pain transmission. This results in a prolonged but reversible reduction in the symptoms of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP).

The capsaicin 8% patch was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2009 for the treatment of PNP in nondiabetic adults, either alone or in combination with other medicinal products, based on an extensive clinical trial program investigating its efficacy and safety for the treatment of NP, particularly in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). Results from the Phase III trials demonstrated that a single 30- or 60-minute application of the capsaicin 8% patch significantly reduced pain for 3 months in patients with HIV-AN or PHN, respectively. The capsaicin 8% patch retains its efficacy upon re-treatment and is effective both as a monotherapy and when used in conjunction with concomitant medications for NP. In the EU, the capsaicin 8% patch is not licensed for use in patients with diabetes due to the lack of data from this patient population as studies are still ongoing.

### Capsaicin 8% for peripheral neuropathic pain treatment: A retrospective cohort study [^112eCBoQ]. Pain Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain is a disabling condition that affects quality of life. Despite recommendations and guidelines, treatment remains suboptimal as it often does not lead to significant symptom relief. The capsaicin 8% patch has been used for the treatment of various peripheral neuropathic pain etiologies with encouraging results.

- **Objectives**: To assess the results of the capsaicin 8% patch on neuropathic pain by evaluating pain intensity and the painful treatment area.

- **Study design**: Observational retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: All patients submitted to capsaicin treatment at the Chronic Pain Unit of the Hospital Centre of Tondela Viseu, from 2011 through 2019.

- **Methods**: Records of capsaicin treatments were reviewed, and the data collected. The primary outcome was pain intensity and painful treatment area reduction between the first and last treatment. Additionally, the number of treatments performed, neuropathic pain duration, anatomic location, pain etiology, and concomitant oral pain medication at baseline and upon treatment conclusion were also listed.

- **Results**: Postsurgical neuropathic pain was the most common etiology (49%), followed by postherpetic (28%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) baseline pain intensity assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) was 6 (5–8) and the median (IQR) final NRS-11 was 3 (1–5), with a median (IQR) relative difference of -0.5 (-0.85–0.17) with statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) between baseline and last pain intensity, regarding all groups. Additionally, there was a reduction in the painful treatment area.

### Ngx-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomised, double-blind study [^1171GZMy]. The Lancet. Neurology (2008). High credibility.

The limitations of treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) have led to the investigation of localized, non-systemic alternatives. NGX-4010, a high-concentration (8%) capsaicin dermal patch, was developed to treat patients with neuropathic pain. We report the results of a randomized, double-blind, 12-week study of the efficacy and safety of one application of NGX-4010 in patients with PHN.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 402 patients were randomly assigned to one 60-minute application of NGX-4010 (640 microg/cm² [8% capsaicin]) or a low-concentration capsaicin control patch (3.2 microg/cm² [0.04% capsaicin]). Patients were aged 18–90 years, had had postherpetic neuralgia for at least 6 months, and had an average baseline numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score of 3 to 9. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks two to eight. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00115310.

- **Findings**: Patients who were randomly assigned to NGX-4010 (n = 206) had a significantly greater reduction in pain during weeks two to eight than did patients who had the control patch (n = 196). The mean changes in NPRS score were -29.6% vs. -19.9% (difference -9.7%, 95% CI -15.47 to -3.95; p = 0.001). 87 (42%) patients who received NGX-4010 and 63 (32%) controls had a 30% or greater reduction in mean NPRS score (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37; p = 0.03). The patients who had NGX-4010 had significant improvements in pain during weeks two to 12.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1119rpsm]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

The study's objective was to compare the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with topical capsaicin for pain relief in osteoarthritis (OA).

A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined any topical NSAID or capsaicin in OA. Pain relief at or nearest to 4 weeks was pooled using a random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) in both Frequentist and Bayesian settings. The analysis was conducted for all trials and specifically for trials using drugs listed as licensed for OA in the British National Formulary (BNF).

The trial network comprised 28 RCTs (7372 participants), of which 17 RCTs (3174 participants) were included in the "as licensed" analyses. No RCTs directly compared topical NSAIDs with capsaicin; placebo was the only common comparator for topical NSAIDs and capsaicin. Frequentist and Bayesian effect size (ES) estimates were in agreement. Topical NSAIDs were statistically superior to placebo overall (ES 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 to 0.41) and in the "as licensed" subgroup (ES 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.39). However, capsaicin was only statistically superior to placebo when used at licensed doses (ES 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.64). No significant differences were observed in pain relief between topical NSAIDs and capsaicin (overall: ES 0.04, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.33; "as licensed": ES -0.09, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.16).

The conclusions indicate that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in licensed doses may be equally effective for pain relief in OA. Whether the equivalence varies between individuals remains unknown.

### Efficacy of Qutenza® (capsaicin) 8% patch for neuropathic pain: a meta-analysis of the Qutenza clinical trials database [^115jxMLs]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Qutenza® is a capsaicin patch used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). The Qutenza Clinical Trials Database has been assembled to more fully characterize the effects of Qutenza. We conducted a within-subject meta-analysis of Qutenza studies to further define the medication's efficacy profile across studies. The meta-analysis combined individual patient data from randomized, controlled studies of Qutenza in peripheral neuropathic pain (1458 subjects treated with approved doses of Qutenza or control patches; 1120 with PHN and 338 with HIV-AN).

These seven studies had similar designs and were performed with the high-dose 8% capsaicin Qutenza patch and a 0.04% low-dose control patch. The difference between treatment groups for the primary efficacy endpoint of percentage change from baseline to weeks 2 to 12 on pain intensity score was calculated. Response was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in mean pain intensity score during weeks 2 to 12. The overall between-group difference in percentage change from baseline in pain intensity was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 4.6, 11.5; p < 0.001), which statistically significantly favored Qutenza over low-dose control.

Qutenza superiority was demonstrated for both PHN and HIV-AN patients for the primary endpoint and the endpoint proportion of 30% pain reduction response, and for PHN patients for the endpoint of proportion of 50% pain reduction response. These results confirm that Qutenza is effective for the treatment of both PHN and HIV-AN.

### Capsaicin inhibits in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis [^116K3sRZ]. Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), a natural product of Capsicum species, is known to induce excitation of nociceptive terminals involved in pain perception. Recent studies have also shown that capsaicin not only has chemopreventive properties against certain carcinogens and mutagens but also exerts anticancer activity. Here, we demonstrated the antiangiogenic activity of capsaicin using in vitro and in vivo assay systems.

- **In vitro experiments**: Capsaicin inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, DNA synthesis, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube formation of primary cultured human endothelial cells. Capsaicin inhibited both VEGF-induced vessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay and VEGF-induced vessel formation in the mouse Matrigel plug assay.

- **In vivo experiments**: Capsaicin was able to suppress tumor-induced angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Capsaicin caused G(1) arrest in endothelial cells. This effect correlated with the down-regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 that led to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein.

- **Signaling experiments**: Capsaicin inhibits VEGF-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p125(FAK), and AKT activation, but its molecular target is distinct from the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that capsaicin is a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis and suggest that it may be valuable to develop pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of angiogenesis-dependent human diseases, such as tumors.

### Capsaicin and menthol in the treatment of itch and pain: Recently cloned receptors provide the key [^116YvGNz]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Topical capsaicin is reported to be an effective treatment for idiopathic intractable pruritus ani. While both capsaicin and menthol application produce a transient perianal burning sensation, only capsaicin relieves itching. Classical observations on functional desensitization of nociceptors by capsaicin may explain the beneficial effects; however, the recent discovery of a range of receptors that respond to capsaicin, menthol, and temperature, along with their expression in subsets of sensory nerve fibers, provides an exciting prospect for advancing our understanding and treatment of sensory dysfunction.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^111mWej5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Capsaicin has been consumed orally by humans worldwide for centuries, and comprehensive reviews of its safety have not identified serious toxicity. Some have conjectured that one or more hepatic metabolites of capsaicin may be mutagenic at very high concentrations. Although the presumed lack of toxicity of capsaicin in food does not preclude adverse effects related to its actions on the skin, topical capsaicin is generally regarded as safe for medical or cosmetic uses. The primary adverse effects are local, transient application site reactions, primarily pain and erythema.

Published non-clinical and clinical data concerning the capsaicin 8% patch do not suggest any special safety concerns regarding skin exposure to capsaicin or its metabolites. Transient increases in arterial pressure associated with the pain experienced during the application procedure were observed during clinical trials.

A theoretical concern relevant to chronic pain management is that in peripheral neuropathies associated with cutaneous denervation, defunctionalization of cutaneous nociceptors could leave areas of skin without sufficient protective sensation to prevent or avoid injury. Additionally, cutaneous C-fibres may play a role in blood flow regulation and wound repair, as substances like P and neurokinin A released by C-fibres can stimulate the growth of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, while CGRP can stimulate the growth of keratinocytes and epithelial cells.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: A retrospective analysis [^115F6rKa]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In all patients (N = 68), the decrease in pain after treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch occurred rapidly and was evident from 7 days posttreatment (Figure 1). At Day 7, there was a significant (P < 0.001) mean reduction in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score compared with baseline. A significant reduction in pain was maintained up to 12 weeks posttreatment; those patients followed up at 12 weeks (N = 44) still exhibited a reduction from baseline pain score of 43.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.3–55.5%; P < 0.001).

- **Figure 1**: Mean NPRS score after treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch. The absolute NPRS scores on Days 0, 3, 7, 28, 56, and 84 posttreatment are shown for patients who were treated once with the capsaicin 8% patch and for patients who received a second treatment. ✱ p < 0.001 for all patients, first treatment. †One patient missed the 4-week follow-up and therefore could not be included in the responder analysis of patients who had a complete follow-up of at least 8 weeks (N = 53); however, 8-week data were available for this patient, so they were included in the data presented here. Likewise, 12-week data were available for N = 45 patients, but only N = 44 patients had a complete follow-up of 12 weeks.

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^114HMMjd]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The assessment of the evolution of responder rates (i.e. the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in average daily pain [Numeric Pain Rating Scale score]) is important to understand the contribution of each application of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch to the overall result. These results have been reported only partially for PACE and not yet for STRIDE. Given the high granularity of the data collected in these two clinical trials, it is feasible to assess the decrease in pain scores and thus responder rates after successive treatments with the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

The objectives of the present post hoc analysis of data from STRIDE and PACE were to investigate:

- **Whether there is any evidence of efficacy**: The capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch was applied in patients who did not achieve a pain response after the first application.

- **How many separate applications may be reasonable**: Determine the number of applications necessary before reaching a conclusion on whether or not to continue treatment.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^116VFphH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

A persistent confusion which continues to appear in the medical literature involves the role of 'substance P depletion' in capsaicin-induced pain relief. The neurogenic inflammation which follows the application of topical capsaicin is due to the vascular actions of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from C-fibres. Mast cell degranulation is contributory but not necessary. There is no evidence that the neurogenic inflammation accompanying topical capsaicin administration is related to prolonged pain relief, even though it has long been appreciated that systemic capsaicin can cause substance P release by nociceptors.

In the early and mid-1980s, researchers observed that skin substance P levels were significantly reduced after topical treatment with capsaicin. At that time, substance P was thought to be a fundamentally important signal for pain neurotransmission, which explains the substantial efforts to develop substance P receptor antagonists. The coincidental reduction of substance P content was inferred to play a causal relationship in capsaicin-induced pain relief.

Since then, substance P receptor antagonists have failed as analgesics in a number of clinical trials, and it is now widely recognized that of all the neuropeptides released by C-fibres, CGRP is a more likely potential contributor to pain pathophysiology, particularly in migraine. If nociceptive nerve fibres retract from the epidermis and dermis, then all markers they contain will be lost, with substance P being just one of many. The reduction of substance P content in skin after topical capsaicin applications is an aspect of these observations.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115qHgAg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and disability for which two topical treatments are used: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin. Topical NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, reversibly block the production of prostanoids, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. Topical NSAIDs, alongside paracetamol, are recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as first-line pharmacological treatments. Over £32 million worth of prescriptions for topical NSAIDs were dispensed in community pharmacies in England in 2016. Topical NSAIDs are also freely available over-the-counter and are widely advertised to consumers.

In contrast, capsaicin, the substance responsible for the warming spiciness of chili peppers, is primarily available on prescription in the UK. Almost 200,000 tubes of 0.025% capsaicin were dispensed in 2016, amounting to over £4 million. Capsaicin is thought to cause defunctionalisation of spontaneously active peripheral nociceptors that otherwise maintain chronic pain conditions.

Topical NSAIDs and capsaicin are applied directly to the skin over the painful joint, and thus, little to no active drug is absorbed into the bloodstream. This results in their favorable safety profiles. Topical administration offers a safe and effective alternative to oral analgesics for people with just one or a few painful peripheral joints, especially for individuals with comorbidities, multiple medications, or those wishing to avoid tablets. The efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA is well-documented.

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^112WZ4a7]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Some patients experience rapid and long-lasting improvements in pain following a single local treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain with the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch, whereas others may follow a more progressive or incremental course of benefit in terms of pain, sleep, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. In the latter individuals, two or even three treatments ≥ 8 weeks apart are needed before a response is achieved. Slower responders appear to "catch up" with rapid responders over time. Repeat treatment may therefore be important to maximize efficacy in those who do not initially respond.

The capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch was also generally well tolerated and was associated with low levels of discontinuations due to adverse events in all subgroups studied.

The potential mechanisms underlying progressive responses to the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch are not fully understood, but they may relate to disease modification through "pruning" of abnormal nerve fibers followed by regeneration of more normal fibers; this effect may become more pronounced with each successive treatment. Further studies are warranted to analyze these mechanisms in different peripheral neuropathic pain conditions.

Capsaicin selectively binds to TRPV1, the vanilloid subtype 1 of the superfamily of transient receptor potential ion channels, which is highly expressed in pain-transmitting C fibers. Recent reports have demonstrated that the coadministration of capsaicin with a local anesthetic (LA) at the rat sciatic nerve elicits a prolonged nociceptive-selective nerve block, suggesting that activation of the TRPV1 receptor may allow LAs to enter the nerve through the TRPV1 pore. In previous studies, we demonstrated that transdermal amitriptyline achieves clinical analgesic effects and is more potent than lidocaine. Here, we examine whether the combined application of amitriptyline and capsaicin as a transdermal patch will produce prolonged cutaneous analgesia compared with amitriptyline alone.

- **Methods**: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weights 250–300 g) were assigned to five treatment groups (n = 6–8 per group). Transdermal patches containing amitriptyline with different concentrations of capsaicin were applied for 3 hours to the rats' shaved backs: 2.5% amitriptyline alone (control group) and in combination with 0.05%, 0.15%, 1%, and 8% capsaicin. Behavioral testing for cutaneous nociception was conducted before drug application and after patch removal using the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex. In addition, skin appearance was assessed to determine irritation by these formulations.

- **Results**: The cutaneous analgesic effect is significantly prolonged when amitriptyline is applied in combination with 8% capsaicin. Amitriptyline alone provided a complete block to pinprick.

### The effects of capsaicin cream on prostaglandin-induced allodynia [^112rrPLD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Although intradermal injection of capsaicin produces acute pain and secondary hyperalgesia, long-term topical application of capsaicin cream has been used as a medication for pain relief in various pain conditions. We previously reported that intrathecal administration of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) and PGF(2alpha) into mice induced touch-evoked pain (allodynia) through capsaicin-sensitive and capsaicin-insensitive afferent fibers, respectively. To clarify the mechanism of an analgesic effect by capsaicin cream, we applied it to the tail and hind paws of mice and investigated its effects on PGE(2)- and PGF(2alpha)-induced allodynia.

Twenty-four-hour pretreatment of mice with 0.025% or 0.05% capsaicin cream markedly alleviated allodynia induced by PGE(2) but not by PGF(2alpha). These results suggest that the topical application of capsaicin cream modulates capsaicin-sensitive afferents and ameliorates allodynia evoked by PGE(2) at the spinal level.

Implications: Topical application of capsaicin cream alleviates touch-evoked pain induced by the intrathecal administration of prostaglandin E(2). This study may provide a rationale for the use of capsaicin cream as a therapeutic drug for pain relief.

### Systematic review of topical capsaicin for the treatment of chronic pain [^117RkXQ9]. BMJ (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of topically applied capsaicin for chronic pain from neuropathic or musculoskeletal disorders, multiple data sources were consulted, including the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, PubMed, an in-house database, and direct contact with manufacturers of topical capsaicin.

Randomised controlled trials were selected, comparing topically applied capsaicin with placebo or another treatment in adults with chronic pain. The primary outcome measured the number of patients with approximately a 50% reduction in pain, with outcomes extracted at four weeks for musculoskeletal conditions and eight weeks for neuropathic conditions. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Six double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 656 patients were analyzed for neuropathic conditions. The relative benefit of topical capsaicin 0.075% compared with placebo was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.7) with a number needed to treat of 5.7 (4.0 to 10.0). Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including 368 patients were pooled for musculoskeletal conditions, with a relative benefit from topical capsaicin 0.025% or plaster compared with placebo of 1.5 (1.1 to 2.0) and a number needed to treat of 8.1 (4.6 to 34). Approximately one-third of patients experienced local adverse events with capsaicin, unlike those who received placebo.

In conclusion, although topically applied capsaicin has moderate to poor efficacy in treating chronic musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain, it may be useful.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: A retrospective analysis [^111PEyXH]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The application procedure for the capsaicin patch was carried out as described previously. The painful area to be treated was identified using pinpricks and/or a brush and was marked on the patient's skin. These markings were used to match the size of the capsaicin 8% patch to the treatment area. As recommended in the product prescribing information, most patients were pretreated with the topical anesthetic cream EMLA (lidocaine 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5%; AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany) for 60 minutes before treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch. EMLA analgesia persists for 1–2 hours following removal of the cream from the skin. Overall, 15 patients were treated with the capsaicin 8% patch without topical anesthetic pretreatment, either due to an allergy to the topical anesthetic or because they chose not to receive pretreatment.

Following removal of the topical anesthetic, the capsaicin 8% patch was applied for 30 minutes to the feet and for 60 minutes to all other areas of the body. To enhance adhesion, the patch was either bandaged to the treatment site using elastic bandages or pressed against the skin using sandbags. After patch removal, the area was cleaned with cleansing gel to remove any residual capsaicin, and cooling measures, such as cool packs wrapped in thin cloth, were placed on the treatment area to reduce any treatment-related discomfort. The duration of cooling was variable, depending on the needs of each individual patient, and it was recommended that patients continue to use cooling measures at home as necessary.

### Capsaicin treatment in neuropathic pain: Axon reflex vasodilatation after 4 weeks correlates with pain reduction [^1119Drwj]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

Capsaicin, an agonist at the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, is used for the topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Reversible receptor defunctionalization and degeneration and subsequent regeneration of cutaneous nociceptors are discussed as its mechanism of action. Here, we hypothesize an accelerated functional recovery of a subclass of nociceptive afferents, the peptidergic vasoactive nociceptors, as the potential cause of capsaicin analgesia.

In this noninterventional exploratory trial, 23 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain were treated with one topical high-concentration capsaicin application. Baseline pain ratings, comorbidities, and quality of life were assessed. Functional laser speckle contrast analysis (heat-evoked neurogenic vasodilatation to assess functional properties of peptidergic nociceptors) and quantitative sensory testing were performed in the affected skin. Four weeks after treatment, functional laser speckle contrast analysis and questionnaires were repeated. Telephone interviews were conducted at weeks 2, 10, and 12.

Topical capsaicin treatment induced a significant reduction in pain intensity with a maximum at 4 weeks. At the same time, heat-evoked neurogenic vasodilatation was on average similar to pretreatment values. Half of the patients not only showed a functional recovery but also an improvement in vasodilatation, indicating regeneration of nerve fibers. Patients with improved heat-evoked neurogenic vasodilatation at week 4 showed a greater pain reduction than those with deterioration.

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^115P5wKq]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As would be expected, treatment discontinuations among nonresponders in both trials resulted primarily from lack of efficacy or withdrawal of consent. In both trials, discontinuation rates were low among responders, and there were no obvious differences in discontinuation profiles among those responding after one, two, or three applications of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

- **Differential use of concomitant pain medications**: Differential use of concomitant pain medication is a potential confounder of the analysis of responses. Across trials and in all three subgroups, pregabalin or gabapentin were more often discontinued than initiated. Opioids were initiated in a slightly higher proportion than discontinued in those responding after the first and second treatment across trials, and hence there are no data to suggest that greater use of other pain medications could explain apparent responses in those who responded only after the second or third application of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

- **Treatment intervals**: Throughout STRIDE.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^11325hWg]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid delivery of capsaicin may promote, rather than reduce, the tolerability of topical capsaicin. Some defunctionalization mechanisms discussed above can occur very rapidly, and in vitro loss of capsaicin responsiveness may develop within 20 seconds. By driving cutaneous nociceptors to a defunctionalized state quickly, the inevitable pungency may be greatly mitigated. Indeed, in clinical studies with the capsaicin 8% patch, fewer than 2% of patients asked for early removal of the patch due to intolerance.

With respect to the site(s) of capsaicin action within the skin, most studies point to the highest level of TRPV1 expression in nociceptive sensory nerve fibers. However, there have been several reports of TRPV1 expression in skin cells other than neurons, particularly in cultured cells. For instance, one report provided indirect evidence that TRPV1 activation mediated functional responses in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). However, when freshly dispersed human keratinocytes were exposed to capsaicin by another group, no functional response was observed at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and 300 μM capsaicin was cytotoxic independent of TRPV1. Such studies emphasize that the presence of mRNA or even measurable protein does not necessarily ensure a physiological role for that protein in a cell type. Furthermore, the interpretation of data from immortal cell lines can be problematic because their phenotypes may diverge from the source tissue. The specificity of TRPV1 immuno-detection in neural elements is primarily noted in human dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^113RV1cc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. Because it was a small randomized study in a specific population of patients with moderate-to-severe OA knee pain, the findings cannot be generalized to the knee OA population at large. In addition, as a small study, data regarding the safety profile is limited, although the findings are consistent with the safety profile of other capsaicin products.

In conclusion, the present results support the efficacy and safety of the intraarticular injection of trans-capsaicin to manage moderate-to-severe pain associated with knee OA. The findings indicate that further clinical development is warranted.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^11659AFe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, directed TRPV1 agonist therapies, in which nociceptor defunctionalization is restricted to discrete target organs such as the skin, may be an attractive treatment to control localized pain or hypersensitivity. There is good evidence for hyperactivity and proliferation of cutaneous nociceptive C-fibres in numerous pain syndromes, and thus topical TRPV1 receptor agonist-mediated defunctionalization warrants evaluation as an approach for their management. Although the 'substance P depletion' hypothesis was attractive in the 1980s, subsequent advances in our understanding of cutaneous innervation and the responses to topical capsaicin have rendered this hypothesis irrelevant. Reduction of substance P content in the skin is just one of many consequences of defunctionalization, and there is no evidence that this process is related causally to pain relief.

An important advantage of the topical capsaicin approach is that this drug is poorly absorbed transdermally in humans and there appear to be few systemic adverse effects or even local effects other than transient application-site reactions such as pain and erythema. The recent approval of the capsaicin 8% patch, which is designed to be used episodically, thus provides an alternative to low-concentration capsaicin-based medicines by providing for longer-term pain relief in some patients, while avoiding the requirement for repeated daily self-administration, lack of patient compliance, and possible home environmental contamination. Given the common use of topical capsaicin in a wide variety of chronic pain syndromes, its role in pain management continues to be of significant interest.

### Effects of epidural capsaicin on nociceptive threshold and neurological functions in rabbits [^112dMz2P]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Capsaicin, as a principal active component of chili peppers, is popularly consumed by many people around the world. Whether capsaicin-induced neuropathy alters the function of sensory neurons is still unknown.

- **Objective**: The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of epidural capsaicin on nociceptive threshold and neurological functions in a rabbit model.

- **Design**: An intrathecal injection system was set up using a rabbit model. Rabbits were treated with capsaicin at doses of 0.04, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/kg once. The changes in neurological functions and morphology of the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots were determined within 24 hours. Changes in the nociceptive threshold in the hind limbs of the rabbits were observed for 30 days.

- **Methods**: Capsaicin's effect on changing neurological functions was evaluated by the neurological functional scores. The structural changes of the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. The nociceptive threshold changes in the rabbits were measured by the responding time for pain induced by a thermostimulation.

- **Results**: The results showed that capsaicin reversed changes in the neurological function of rabbit hind limbs. In the 0.10 and 0.20 mg/kg groups, structural abnormalities were found in the rabbit is spinal nerves. Capsaicin also significantly increased the pain threshold in rabbits when compared with the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The maximum values of pain threshold were found in the 0.10 mg/kg capsaicin group after 3 days of capsa.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^111Dfvpt]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Capsaicin has played an important role in folk medicine, often based on the principle of using like to treat like — for example, treating burning pain with a substance that causes burning pain. The first formal report of the pain-reducing properties of topical capsaicin in the West appeared in 1850, recommending the use of an alcoholic hot pepper extract on burning or itching extremities.

Creams, lotions, and patches containing capsaicin, generally in the range of 0.025–0.1% by weight, are now sold in many countries, often without a prescription, for managing neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. Clinical studies of these medications, usually involving three to five topical skin applications per day for periods of 2–6 weeks, have generally suggested modest beneficial effects against various pain syndromes, including post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic neuropathy, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Low-concentration capsaicin-based products often result in contamination of the patient's environment (clothing, bedding, contact lenses, etc), and each application may be associated with a burning sensation. Poor patient compliance with these products is often cited as a likely contributor to their limited efficacy.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^112bSFLq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

- **Editor's key points**: Topical capsaicin is used in pain management. The mechanism of action (MoA) was thought to be by depletion of substance P. A more likely MoA is described as 'defunctionalization', and involves alteration of several mechanisms involved in pain. A new higher concentration (8%) patch shows promise in pain management.

Topical capsaicin formulations are widely used to manage pain. Low-concentration creams, lotions, and patches intended for daily skin application have been available in most countries since the early 1980s. Prescriptions are usually not needed for these self-administered medicines, which often have not been reviewed formally by drug regulatory authorities. The recent approval in the EU and USA of a prescription-strength high-concentration single-administration capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) with a duration of action over many weeks invites an examination of recent advances in the understanding of capsaicin's mechanism and site of action.

In this review, which does not cover other naturally occurring or synthetic TRPV1 agonists, we discuss the potential utility of topically administered capsaicin for the management of pain in classical peripheral neuropathies and other hypersensitivity disorders, some of which are currently considered as idiopathic. Furthermore, we seek to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of capsaicin treatment and clarify misunderstandings, particularly with respect to the involvement of substance P depletion.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^114Ayd8H]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

As a retrospective analysis, this study is limited by a lack of randomization and placebo control and only represents experience from a single clinic. Consequently, additional analysis of patient responses to the capsaicin 8% patch in other real-life clinical settings will be required to validate the data presented here. Additional studies across a wider variety of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) conditions are also warranted, and patient benefits relating to the reduction in the use of concomitant medications should be explored further. Nevertheless, the data presented here support the efficacy of the capsaicin 8% patch to treat neuropathic pain (NP) and suggest that response rates may even be higher when used in real-life clinical practice than they were during clinical trials. Furthermore, the data show that the capsaicin 8% patch can provide rapid and sustained reductions in pain levels in patients with a variety of PNP conditions, together with a significant reduction in the requirement for prescribed concomitant pain medications. These data indicate that the capsaicin 8% patch will be a very useful addition to the treatment options available for NP.

### Roles of capsaicin-insensitive nociceptors in cutaneous pain and secondary hyperalgesia [^113cXpcP]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

Polymodal nociceptors respond to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. While sensitivities to heat and the irritant substance capsaicin have recently been linked via the properties of the vanilloid receptor type 1 ion channel, sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, such as the pinpricks used in clinical neurology, seems to be unrelated. We investigated the peripheral neural basis of pinprick pain using quantitative psychophysical techniques combined with selective conduction block by nerve compression and selective desensitization by topical capsaicin treatment.

Complete A-fibre block by compression of the superficial radial nerve (criterion: loss of first pain sensation) lowered the stimulus-response function for pinprick pain (-82 ± 6% versus baseline). Topical pretreatment of the skin with a 10% capsaicin cream also lowered the pinprick stimulus-response function (-32 ± 10%), whereas laser-evoked heat pain was completely eliminated (-96 ± 2%). Under combined capsaicin desensitization and A-fibre blockade, pinprick pain was completely eliminated (-98 ± 1%).

The intradermal injection of 40 micrograms of capsaicin into normal skin between two skin areas that had been pretreated with either capsaicin cream or vehicle produced secondary hyperalgesia with a 260% enhancement of the stimulus-response function for pinprick pain in both areas. In contrast, axon reflexive flare spread only into the vehicle-treated area. These results suggest that capsaicin-sensitive afferents, including polymodal A-fibre and C-fibre nociceptors, make a small contribution to pinprick pain.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^112m7YK6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

In an attempt to evaluate whether pain relief could be achieved by a single exposure to a much higher concentration of topical capsaicin, 10 patients with intractable pain syndromes were treated with a compounded high-concentration 5–10% w/w cream. Patients were provided regional anaesthesia for tolerability, and airborne contamination of treatment rooms occurred. Based on encouraging results, a high-concentration capsaicin-containing (8%) patch designated NGX-4010 and then given the trade name Qutenza™ was developed and evaluated.

The capsaicin 8% patch is designed to rapidly deliver capsaicin into the skin while minimizing unwanted systemic or environmental exposure of capsaicin to patients and health-care providers. Phase 1 data suggested that a single 60-minute patch application was adequate to induce nociceptor defunctionalization, as measured by reversible reduction in intra-epidermal nerve fibres (ENFs), marked by the structural nerve marker protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 immunostaining, and small, reversible alterations in cutaneous nociceptor function. Phase 3 studies demonstrated efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). For both neuropathic pain syndromes, efficacy was observed to last for 12 weeks. Blinding was provided by a control patch which contained sufficient capsaicin to induce pain and erythema in a substantial number of subjects.

Cannabinoids

Clinical trials provide little medical evidence that cannabinoid-based medicines are effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in 16 patients could also not support a substantial benefit of cannabinoids in treating CIPN. According to the guideline of the German Society for Neurology, cannabinoids are not recommended for treatment of neuropathic pain of any origin as efficacy is low and the rate of side effects is high. In individual cases and upon failure of other therapeutic options, treatment with cannabinoids may be considered in the context of a multimodal pain therapy.

- **Pharmacological intervention — topical therapies**:

	- **Patches**:

		I. Lidocaine
		The lidocaine patch (700 mg) is approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia but has also been suggested by guidelines for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain of other origins, including CIPN. However, randomized clinical trials proving efficacy in CIPN are missing at the time of writing. Lidocaine patches might be used as a second-line option for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, especially in cases of intolerability of oral medications (e.g. in elderly patients).

		II. Capsaicin
		In Europe, the capsaicin patch (179 mg) is approved for the topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain as monotherapy or in combination with other pharmaceutical products for pain treatment. The guideline of the German Society for Neurology recommends the capsaicin 179 mg patch for any kind of neuropathic pain as a second-line therapy.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^111popQs]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Efficacy measurements were assessed using the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), asking patients the question, "What is your pain now?" All patients received a baseline assessment in the clinic on the day of capsaicin 8% patch treatment to determine pretreatment pain levels. The patient's pain was assessed immediately after capsaicin 8% patch treatment, and then on Days 1 and 3, and during Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 following. Follow-up was carried out by telephone call or face-to-face clinic contact on Days 1 and 3, and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.

The change in pain was assessed both in absolute terms (unit of NPRS change) and as a percentage change from baseline (prior to the first capsaicin 8% patch treatment). Pain response to the first capsaicin 8% patch treatment was calculated as the percentage change between the baseline NPRS value and the average of NPRS scores at Weeks 1, 4, and 8. As in the capsaicin 8% clinical trials, a responder was defined as a patient who exhibited a ≥ 30% decrease in NPRS score from baseline.

- **Re-treatment**: Patients were re-treated with the capsaicin 8% patch when their pain significantly increased and they were in discomfort again; pain did not have to return to baseline levels for re-treatment to be undertaken.

- **Prescribed concomitant pain medication use**: Prescribed concomitant pain medications taken by patients were assessed throughout the follow-up period, and these medications were modified as appropriate. At the 4-week follow-up, potential changes to prescribed concomitant neuropathic pain medications were discussed with the patient.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^116689W9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Topical capsaicin formulations are used for pain management. The safety and modest efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin formulations, which require repeated daily self-administration, are supported by meta-analyses of numerous studies. A high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) was recently approved in the EU and USA. A single 60-minute application in patients with neuropathic pain produced effective pain relief for up to 12 weeks.

Advantages of the high-concentration capsaicin patch include longer duration of effect, patient compliance, and low risk for systemic effects or drug-drug interactions. The mechanism of action of topical capsaicin has been ascribed to depletion of substance P. However, experimental and clinical studies show that the depletion of substance P from nociceptors is only a correlate of capsaicin treatment and has little, if any, causative role in pain relief. Rather, topical capsaicin acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity and reduce pain through a process best described as 'defunctionalization' of nociceptor fibres.

Defunctionalization is due to several effects, including temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals. Peripheral neuropathic hypersensitivity is mediated by diverse mechanisms. These include altered expression of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 or other key ion channels in affected or intact adjacent peripheral nociceptive nerve fibres, aberrant re-innervation, and collateral sprouting.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114zgaNk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

This work forms part of a project examining the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA and neuropathic pain. The protocol is published and is also available on PROSPERO (2016: CRD42016035254).

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical NSAID or capsaicin to placebo in participants with OA were included. No other comparators were included for this analysis and only placebo-controlled trials were examined. Participants with painful physician-diagnosed OA (clinical or radiographic) or chronic joint pain attributable to OA at any site (excluding the spine) were included. Spinal pain was excluded as it is difficult to differentiate between OA pain and back pain secondary to other aetiologies. Trials with pain due to multiple conditions were included if the data for OA could be extracted separately. Trials had to be a minimum of 1 week duration and report pain outcomes. Full texts published in any language and at any date were considered.

- **Identification and selection of trials**: A search strategy based on terms for (1) RCTs, (2) topical administration, (3) OA, and (4) capsaicin or NSAIDs was created. Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched up to 16/11/2015, and the searches were updated on 10/01/2018. In addition, reference lists of included publications and meta-analyses in the area were searched for eligible trials.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1171NcEr]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

Although pain in osteoarthritis (OA) has traditionally been viewed as nociceptive in nature, it is now widely accepted that some people experience pain with neuropathic-like components. Pain descriptors indicative of neuropathic pain, such as "burning" and "shooting" pain, are used by subsets of individuals with OA. In fact, almost 15% of people with knee pain report neuropathic-like pain. This subgroup is of importance as true neuropathic pain is often difficult to manage and commonly does not respond to traditional analgesics, such as NSAIDs. Capsaicin, however, is licensed and used in neuropathic pain, where it is effective at higher doses. It may therefore be that individuals with predominantly nociceptive OA pain benefit from topical NSAIDs, while those with neuropathic pain components may benefit more from topical capsaicin. Further evidence on pain phenotypes and response to these two commonly used topical analgesics is warranted.

### Role of capsaicin in a murine model of labor and delivery [^116mmjKH]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to develop a murine model of labor and delivery and to use this model to examine whether capsaicin diminishes labor pain and expedites delivery.

- **Methods**: To develop a murine model of labor pain, the authors identified and compared the incidence of four proposed pain behaviors in 46 mice: (1) no analgesia in labor and the postpartum period, and (2) increasing doses of an analgesic, morphine. The model was then used to examine the impact of topical cervical capsaicin on: (1) labor pain behaviors and (2) labor progress by examining its impact on the time from treatment to delivery of the first pup and on the duration of delivery per pup. The treatment was randomly allocated, and the behavioral observation was blinded.

- **Results**: In the absence of analgesia, there was a statistically significant decrease in all four proposed pain behaviors in the postpartum period compared with labor (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1/h vs. 16.1 ± 8.7/h; P < 0.0001). Additionally, morphine reduced their incidence during labor in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1.7/h control, 46.4 ± 15.8 morphine 0.1 mg/kg/h, 34.6 ± 5.6/h, morphine 0.5 mg/kg/h; P = 0.1988, 0.0014). Furthermore, the incidence of identified pain behaviors was reduced by pericervical capsaicin (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1.7/h control, 38.9 ± 15.4 capsaicin, P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: In this pilot study, the authors developed a novel mouse model of labor and delivery. Pericervical capsaicin applied days before delivery reduces labor pain behaviors.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^117FM3mB]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The site of action of topical capsaicin is in the skin, and pain relief is not mediated by transdermal systemic delivery. Due to its near insolubility in water, capsaicin is not readily absorbed into the microvasculature. When cutaneous nociceptors are hypersensitive and sometimes spontaneously active, localized defunctionalization of capsaicin-responsive nerve fiber terminals in the epidermis and dermis can reduce the afferent barrage, which may drive pain syndromes. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to nerve terminal retraction.

- **Reversible ENF loss**: Topical capsaicin treatment leads to a reversible loss of epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs). Human leg (calf) skin biopsies were analyzed pre-capsaicin treatment (baseline; PGP 9.5; TRPV1), 1 day post-treatment (PGP 9.5; TRPV1), and 54 days post-treatment (PGP 9.5; TRPV1). Biopsies were immunostained with antibodies to the structural nerve marker PGP 9.5, and heat and capsaicin receptor TRPV1. There was a marked loss of ENFs and sub-ENFs after capsaicin treatment for 3 days (day 1 biopsy), with regeneration of a majority of ENFs by day 54. Magnification ×40.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^116j1dpL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Topical capsaicin formulations are used for pain management. The safety and modest efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin formulations, which require repeated daily self-administration, are supported by meta-analyses of numerous studies. A high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) was recently approved in the EU and USA. A single 60-minute application in patients with neuropathic pain produced effective pain relief for up to 12 weeks. Advantages of the high-concentration capsaicin patch include longer duration of effect, patient compliance, and low risk for systemic effects or drug–drug interactions.

The mechanism of action of topical capsaicin has been ascribed to the depletion of substance P. However, experimental and clinical studies show that the depletion of substance P from nociceptors is only a correlate of capsaicin treatment and has little, if any, causative role in pain relief. Instead, topical capsaicin acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity and reduce pain by a process best described as the 'defunctionalization' of nociceptor fibres. Defunctionalization is due to a number of effects that include a temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to an altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals.

Peripheral neuropathic hypersensitivity is mediated by diverse mechanisms, including altered expression of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 or other key ion channels in affected or intact adjacent peripheral nociceptive nerve fibres, aberrant re-innervation, and collateral sprouting.
