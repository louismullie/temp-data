## Question

Diagnostic paracentesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnostic paracentesis — specifically, when it is indicated, how urgently it should be performed, which laboratory tests are essential and how to interpret them (especially SAAG and PMN thresholds), the proper culture technique and timing relative to antibiotics, procedural safety considerations including coagulation parameters and ultrasound guidance, as well as special scenarios, follow-up strategies, and how to synthesize a practical algorithm with supporting evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when diagnostic paracentesis is indicated and how urgently it should be performed. Then, I should verify the essential laboratory tests and how to interpret them, especially SAAG and PMN thresholds. Next, I will review culture technique and timing relative to antibiotics. After that, I need to check procedural safety, including coagulation parameters and ultrasound guidance. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, follow-up strategies, and synthesize a practical algorithm with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the indications and timing, because missing SBP can be lethal. All patients with new-onset ascites should undergo diagnostic paracentesis as soon as feasible, and in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites, paracentesis should be performed urgently to rule out SBP even without overt infection signs, ideally within 12–24 hours of admission, as delays worsen outcomes [^116i32Wu] [^1135CgdZ] [^112mQfR9] [^1168tprL].

> Wait, let me verify the high-risk triggers that mandate immediate paracentesis. I need to ensure I capture GI bleeding, shock, fever or systemic inflammation, GI symptoms, encephalopathy, and worsening liver or renal function, because these are consistently flagged as indications for urgent paracentesis to exclude SBP in major guidelines [^115rep35] [^116t4VbE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient chronic ascites. I should confirm that routine diagnostic paracentesis is not mandated for stable, chronic ascites without new symptoms, but any change in condition warrants reassessment and often a tap, aligning with guideline nuance and clinical judgment [^116UQH9A] [^114fDbhH].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory tests and their interpretation. I need to check that the initial analysis includes ascitic neutrophil count, total protein, ascitic albumin, and simultaneous serum albumin to calculate SAAG, because SAAG greater than 1.1 g/dL strongly supports portal hypertension, whereas SAAG less than 1.1 g/dL suggests non-portal causes such as malignancy, TB, or pancreatitis [^1177Wn5b] [^113Brfv2] [^114Qadwe].

> I will now examine the SBP diagnostic threshold. The diagnosis of SBP requires an ascitic PMN count greater than 250 cells/mm³, and I should double-check that this remains the gold standard across guidelines, with manual microscopy or flow cytometry acceptable methods and reagent strips not recommended for routine use [^116i32Wu] [^116xctRG] [^111TCEBn].

> Let me think about culture technique, because yield matters for therapy. I should confirm that bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid into both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before antibiotics increases sensitivity to over 90%, and that culture positivity is not required to diagnose SBP when the PMN threshold is met [^111QMCdv] [^116i32Wu] [^116iQsaf].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on antibiotics when we arrive. I need to ensure we still obtain cultures promptly and consider repeating the tap in 48 hours if there is no clinical improvement or if secondary peritonitis is suspected, as recommended by AASLD for response assessment and management adjustments [^114HwRD6] [^1131FfV3].

> Next, I should review procedural safety and coagulation considerations. Routine pre-procedure INR and platelet checks are not required for diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis in cirrhosis, and transfusion thresholds are generally not indicated given low bleeding risk and potential harm; exceptions include active anticoagulation or severe thrombocytopenia, where individualized risk assessment is prudent [^113axVWH] [^114NEVFA] [^1148hJci].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of ultrasound. Ultrasound guidance improves success and reduces complications, particularly bleeding, and is recommended to mark the site and avoid vessels; real-time guidance is helpful for small or loculated collections, and training with simulation is advised to build competence [^116ghThQ] [^1148hJci] [^112h38if].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios beyond cirrhosis. If malignancy is suspected, cytology and selected tumor markers can aid diagnosis, though sensitivity varies and image-guided tissue biopsy may be needed. If pancreatic ascites is suspected, ascitic amylase and lipase are informative. If TB is on the table, ADA and mycobacterial cultures may be considered based on pretest probability [^111KuzhC] [^1115uioo] [^112c5pAS].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and pregnancy contexts. In children with cirrhosis and ascites, diagnostic paracentesis is indicated with fever, abdominal pain, or clinical deterioration, and transplant evaluation should be initiated. In pregnancy, I should confirm that ultrasound guidance and maternal-fetal considerations are prioritized to mitigate risk [^116ghThQ] [^113J55qz].

> Next, I should review follow-up and response assessment. If SBP is treated, repeating diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours to document a greater than 25% decrease in PMN supports response; lack of decrease should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis, with total antibiotic duration typically 5–7 days [^114HwRD6] [^1131FfV3].

> I should double-check the evidence on timing and outcomes to reinforce urgency. Early paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission is associated with lower in-hospital mortality, shorter length of stay, and less AKI, and each hour of delay in SBP increases mortality risk, underscoring the need for rapid diagnostic action [^112mQfR9] [^1168tprL].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without losing nuance. New-onset ascites or any hospitalized cirrhosis patient with ascites warrants urgent diagnostic paracentesis with SAAG, total protein, albumin, and PMN count, plus bedside cultures before antibiotics. If PMN is greater than 250 cells/mm³, treat empirically for SBP and reassess at 48 hours, while using SAAG and total protein to classify etiology and guide further workup. If the patient is stable with chronic ascites and no new symptoms, routine repeat taps are not mandated, but any deterioration should trigger re-evaluation and often a new tap [^1135CgdZ] [^112rQo9V] [^116UQH9A].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality and systems issues are addressed. Underuse and delays in paracentesis are common, and targeted QI initiatives can increase early procedure rates. Embedding order sets, education, and ultrasound access are key levers to close the performance gap and improve outcomes [^111MDNm1] [^1136rhhV] [^111aXzxq].

---

Diagnostic paracentesis is indicated for all patients with new-onset ascites [^116UQH9A] or any change in ascites in cirrhosis [^114fDbhH], and for anyone with suspected infection, encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, or gastrointestinal bleeding [^115rep35]. The essential tests are **ascitic cell count with differential** [^1135CgdZ], **albumin and total protein** (to calculate SAAG) [^113Brfv2], and **bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles** for culture [^116i32Wu]. An ascitic neutrophil count > 250/mm³ [^112rQo9V] diagnoses SBP and mandates immediate antibiotics; SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension, whereas SAAG < 1.1 g/dL suggests malignancy, infection, or pancreatitis [^1137WuCd]. Ultrasound guidance improves safety and yield [^116ghThQ], and routine coagulation testing is not required unless there is severe thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation [^113axVWH]. Early paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission reduces mortality and length of stay [^112mQfR9].

---

## Indications for diagnostic paracentesis

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in the following scenarios:

- **New-onset ascites**: Perform in all patients with new-onset ascites accessible for sampling [^116UQH9A] [^1135CgdZ].

- **Worsening ascites or complications**: Perform in hospitalized patients with worsening ascites or any complication of cirrhosis [^114fDbhH] [^114XA1hC].

- **Suspected infection**: Perform in patients with ascites who develop symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection [^112kcbT5] [^116i32Wu].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Perform in patients with cirrhosis and ascites who present with gastrointestinal bleeding [^115rep35] [^116t4VbE].

- **Shock, fever, or systemic inflammation**: Perform in patients with shock, fever, or other signs of systemic inflammation [^115rep35] [^116t4VbE].

- **Hepatic encephalopathy or renal dysfunction**: Perform in patients with hepatic encephalopathy or worsening renal function [^115rep35] [^116t4VbE].

---

## Essential laboratory tests and clinical evaluations

The following laboratory tests and clinical evaluations are recommended for diagnostic paracentesis:

| **Test/evaluation** | **Purpose** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Ascitic cell count and differential | Detect infection, malignancy, or inflammation | Neutrophil count > 250/mm³ indicates SBP [^112rQo9V] [^116xctRG] |
| Ascitic albumin and total protein | Calculate SAAG and assess portal hypertension | SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension [^111KuzhC] [^114Qadwe] |
| Bedside culture (aerobic and anaerobic) | Identify infectious organisms | Bedside inoculation increases yield [^114Qadwe] [^116i32Wu] |
| Serum albumin | Calculate SAAG | Differentiates portal hypertension from other causes [^111KuzhC] [^114Qadwe] |
| Gram stain | Rapid identification of bacteria | Limited sensitivity but useful in acute settings [^notfound] |
| Cytology | Detect malignant cells | Indicated if malignancy is suspected [^113Uq3Zz] [^1115uioo] |
| Amylase, LDH, triglycerides | Differentiate specific etiologies | Useful in suspected pancreatic, malignant, or chylous ascites [^1137WuCd] |

---

## Interpretation of results

Interpretation of ascitic fluid analysis guides diagnosis and management:

- **SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL**: Indicates portal hypertension-related ascites (e.g. cirrhosis, heart failure) [^111KuzhC] [^114Qadwe].

- **SAAG < 1.1 g/dL**: Suggests non-portal hypertension causes (e.g. malignancy, infection, pancreatitis) [^111KuzhC] [^1137WuCd].

- **Neutrophil count > 250/mm³**: Diagnoses SBP, requiring immediate antibiotic therapy [^112rQo9V] [^117NWCVk].

- **Positive culture**: Identifies causative organisms, guiding antibiotic selection [^116sj21P] [^116iQsaf].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While diagnostic paracentesis is generally safe, certain precautions should be observed:

- **Coagulopathy**: Routine measurement of prothrombin time and platelet count is not recommended unless severe thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation is present [^113axVWH] [^114NEVFA].

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Recommended to reduce complications, especially in patients with limited fluid or difficult anatomy [^116ghThQ] [^1148hJci].

- **Informed consent**: Patients should be informed of potential risks, including bleeding, infection, and organ injury [^1148hJci] [^113MXKL3].

---

## Complications and risks

Diagnostic paracentesis is associated with minimal risks, including:

- **Bleeding**: Rare, but can occur, especially in patients with coagulopathy [^1148hJci] [^111y2Y7Z].

- **Infection**: Rare, but possible [^113MXKL3].

- **Organ injury**: Rare, but possible [^113MXKL3].

- **Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid**: Occurs in approximately 5% of cases [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and impact on patient management

Diagnostic paracentesis significantly impacts patient management by enabling early detection and treatment of SBP, reducing mortality and length of hospital stay [^112mQfR9]. Early paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced in-hospital mortality and acute kidney injury [^112mQfR9].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in children with ascites and fever, abdominal pain, or clinical deterioration [^116HjauE] [^113J55qz].

- **Refractory ascites**: Repeated diagnostic paracentesis may be necessary to monitor response to therapy and detect complications [^114HwRD6] [^116sj21P].

- **Malignant ascites**: Cytology and tumor markers may be indicated to differentiate malignant from non-malignant ascites [^113Uq3Zz] [^1115uioo].

---

Diagnostic paracentesis is a critical procedure in the evaluation and management of ascites, providing essential information about the etiology of ascites and guiding appropriate treatment strategies. Early performance of diagnostic paracentesis significantly improves patient outcomes, reducing mortality and length of hospital stay [^112mQfR9].

### Physician clinical impression does not rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients undergoing emergency department paracentesis [^117VcRDt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether clinical characteristics and physician assessment are useful in the exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in emergency department (ED) patients with ascites requiring paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis. Predefined clinical characteristics including historical features and ED vital signs were recorded. Each patient was assessed by 2 separate, blinded physicians for severity of abdominal tenderness and overall clinical suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the individual clinical characteristics and the physician assessments. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/mm³ or positive fluid culture result.

Results

There were 285 separate physician assessments in 144 patients enrolled with complete data. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed in 17 (11.8%) patients. Physician clinical impression had a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62% to 91%) and specificity of 34% (95% CI 28% to 40%) for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The lowest negative LR was associated with the presence of any abdominal pain or tenderness (negative LR = 0.4); however, the presence of pain/tenderness was also observed in 85% of patients without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Six patients (4.2%) with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had at least 1 physician assessment of little to no risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and 3 of the 6 subsequently died during their hospitalization.

Conclusion

Clinical characteristics and physician assessment were insufficient in the diagnosis or exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the ED patient undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis. This finding supports routine laboratory fluid analysis after ED paracentesis.

### The practice and implications of finding fluid during point-of-care ultrasonography: a review [^112h38if]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is an increasingly affordable and portable technology that is an important part of 21st-century medicine. When appropriately used, POCUS has the potential to expedite diagnosis and improve procedural success and safety. POCUS is now being adopted in medical education as early as the first year of medical school. While potentially powerful and versatile, POCUS is a user-dependent technology that has not been formalized or standardized yet within internal medicine residency training programs. Physicians and residency directors are trying to determine whether to incorporate POCUS, and if so, how. In this systematic review, basic concepts and applications of POCUS are examined, as are issues surrounding training and implementation.

Observations

A key use of POCUS is to detect fluid, and this is a cornerstone of POCUS teaching. Even in inexperienced hands, POCUS has shown to be more sensitive and specific than physical examination for conditions such as ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Detecting fluid requires a basic understanding of ultrasonography operation, sonographic anatomy, and probe orientation. Once fluid is localized, ultrasonographic guidance can increase success and decrease complications of common procedures such as thoracentesis or paracentesis.

Conclusions and Relevance

POCUS can augment physical examination and procedural efficacy but requires appropriate education and program setup. As POCUS continues to spread, internal medicine physicians need to clarify how they intend to use this technology. Equipment is now increasingly accessible, but programs need to determine how to allocate time and resources to training, clinical use, and quality assurance. Programs that develop robust implementation processes that establish proper scope of practice and include quality assurance that use image archival and feedback can ensure POCUS will positively impact patient care across hospital systems.

### Vascular ultrasonography: a novel method to reduce paracentesis related major bleeding [^115tdm9a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Paracentesis is a core competency for hospitalists. Using ultrasound for fluid localization is standard practice and involves a low-frequency probe. Experts recommend a "2-probe technique, " which incorporates a high-frequency ultrasound probe in addition to the low-frequency probe to identify blood vessels within the intended needle path. Evidence is currently lacking to support this 2-probe technique, so we performed a pre- to postintervention study to evaluate its effect on paracentesis-related bleeding complications. From February 2010 to August 2011, procedures were performed using only low-frequency probes (preintervention group), while the 2-probe technique was used from September 2011 to February 2016 (postintervention group). A total of 5777 procedures were performed. Paracentesis-related minor bleeding was similar between groups. Major bleeding was lower in the postintervention group (3 [0.3%], n = 1000 vs 4 [0.08%], n = 4777; P = 0.07). This clinically meaningful trend suggests that using the 2-probe technique might prevent paracentesis-related major bleeding.

Ultrasound guidance

Use of ultrasound guidance may reduce the adverse events related to LVP. In a study involving 1297 procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound guidance and 574 (44%) without where the indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound-guided procedures. In another retrospective cohort study, 0.8% of 565 patients undergoing paracentesis experienced bleeding complications. After adjustment, ultrasound guidance was associated with lower risk of bleeding complications by 68%.

Recommendations

Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate and Recommendation: strong)

### Management of coagulopathy among patients with cirrhosis undergoing upper endoscopy and paracentesis: persistent gaps and areas of consensus in a multispecialty Delphi [^114NEVFA]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis have abnormal coagulation indices such as a high international normalized ratio and low platelet count, but these do not correlate well with periprocedural bleeding risk. We sought to develop a consensus among the multiple stakeholders in cirrhosis care to inform process measures that can help improve the quality of the periprocedural management of coagulopathy in cirrhosis. We identified candidate process measures for periprocedural coagulopathy management in multiple contexts relating to the performance of paracentesis and upper endoscopy. An 11-member panel with content expertise was convened. It included nominees from professional societies for interventional radiology, transfusion medicine, and anesthesia as well as representatives from hematology, emergency medicine, transplant surgery, and community practice. Each measure was evaluated for agreement using a modified Delphi approach (3 rounds of rating) to define the final set of measures. Out of 286 possible measures, 33 measures made the final set. International normalized ratio testing was not required for diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis as well as diagnostic endoscopy. Plasma transfusion should be avoided for all paracenteses and diagnostic endoscopy. No consensus was achieved for these items in therapeutic intent or emergent endoscopy. The risks of prophylactic platelet transfusions exceed their benefits for outpatient diagnostic paracentesis and diagnostic endosopies. For the other procedures examined, the risks outweigh benefits when platelet count is > 20,000/mm³. It is uncertain whether risks outweigh benefits below 20,000/mm³ in other contexts. No consensus was achieved on whether it was permissible to continue or stop systemic anticoagulation. Continuous aspirin was permissible for each procedure. Clopidogrel was permissible for diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis and diagnostic endoscopy. We found many areas of consensus that may serve as a foundation for a common set of practice metrics for the periprocedural management of coagulopathy in cirrhosis.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111y2Y7Z]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Bedside paracentesis still remains a relatively low‐risk procedure when utilizing ultrasound. However, when complications do occur, it is often associated with high morbidity. We found that post‐paracentesis AKI risk is not affected by the volume of ascites removed, but it is heightened in patients with higher MELD‐Na scores and when performed in patients already experiencing clinical deterioration. Additionally, the risk of hemorrhagic complications remained low in our cohort, but interestingly higher rates were seen in patients with elevated AST levels and those that had larger pockets of ascites pre‐procedure and larger volumes removed.

### Early diagnostic paracentesis improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mQfR9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital, but adherence is suboptimal with unclear impact on clinical outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the outcomes of early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies comparing early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with confidence intervals (CIs) for proportional and continuous variables were calculated using the random-effects model. Early diagnostic paracentesis was defined as receiving diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Seven studies (n = 78,744) (n = 45,533 early vs n = 33,211 delayed diagnostic paracentesis) were included. Early diagnostic paracentesis was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82, P = 0.001), length of hospital stay (mean difference -4.85 days; 95% CI -6.45 to -3.20; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.02) compared with delayed diagnostic paracentesis, with similar 30-day readmission (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52–2.39, P = 0.79). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results for in-hospital mortality whether early diagnostic paracentesis performed within 12 hours (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.79, P = 0.003, I² = 0%) or within 24 hours of admission (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45–0.98, P = 0.04, I² = 82%). Notably, the mortality OR was numerically lower when diagnostic paracentesis was performed within 12 hours, and the results were precise and homogenous (I² = 0%).

Discussion

Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that early diagnostic paracentesis is associated with better patient outcomes. Early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours of admission may be associated with the greatest mortality benefit. Data from large-scale randomized trials are needed to validate our findings, especially if there is a greater mortality benefit for early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^1111AaRS]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115o9h96]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

### Emergency diagnostic paracentesis to determine intraperitoneal fluid identity discovered on bedside ultrasound of unstable patients [^116zWxRX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with hypotension may be evaluated with a FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) examination as recent literature has suggested its utility in the unstable patient. Those who are found to have intraperitoneal fluid on the FAST examination may have solid organ injury from unknown trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hemorrhaging ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or other disease process responsible for intra-periteal blood. However, because ultrasound does not assist in fluid identification, it is possible that the fluid present is not blood, but ascites. Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid. In each case the fluid was sampled and proposed management changed due to fluid identification.

### Paracentesis is associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and ascites [^111aXzxq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis who are admitted to the hospital for ascites or encephalopathy. However, it is not known whether clinicians in the United States adhere to this recommendation; a relationship between paracentesis and clinical outcome has not been reported. We analyzed a U.S. database to determine the frequency of paracentesis and its association with mortality.

Methods

The 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (which contains data from approximately 8 million hospital discharges each year) was used to identify patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges were compared for those who did and did not undergo paracentesis. Outcomes were compared for those who received an early paracentesis (within 1 day of admission) and those who received one later.

Results

Of 17,711 eligible admissions, only 61% underwent paracentesis. In-hospital mortality was reduced by 24% among patients who underwent paracentesis (6.5% vs 8.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.74). Most paracenteses (66%) occurred ≤ 1 day after admission. In-hospital mortality was lower among patients who received early paracentesis than those who received it later (5.7% vs 8.1%, P = 0.049), although this difference was not significant after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–2.02). Among patients who underwent paracentesis, the mean hospital stay was 14% longer and hospital charges were 29% greater than for patients who did not receive the procedure.

Conclusions

Paracentesis is underused for patients admitted to the hospital with ascites; the procedure is associated with increased short-term survival. These data support practice guidelines derived from expert opinion. Studies are needed to identify barriers to guideline adherence.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116i32Wu]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)/spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) evaluation — patients with ascites due to cirrhosis emergently admitted to the hospital should undergo a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis to rule out SBP even in the absence of symptoms/signs of infection, and patients with ascites who develop signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection should undergo workup for infection plus a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis (for cell count and bacteriological culture); if the workup is negative and the patient has a pleural effusion, the patient should undergo a diagnostic thoracentesis; the ascitic fluid should be cultured at the bedside in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before initiation of antibiotics, and bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of the ascitic sample into blood culture bottles increases the sensitivity of the culture to > 90% in the diagnosis of SBP; the diagnosis of SBP/SBE is established with a fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count > 250/mm³.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/microL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/microL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/microL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^1174GMGJ]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer — diagnostic tissue acquisition and surrogate markers include minimally invasive biopsy options and selective use of laparoscopy, with a biomarker ratio when histology is unavailable. Minimally invasive biopsy procedures may include paracentesis and thoracocentesis for cytology or needle tissue biopsy for pathology. An image-guided intra-abdominal tissue biopsy can be obtained where there is established clinical capacity. Laparoscopy can be used to obtain tissue for histologic diagnosis and assessment of the extent of disease for determination of whether to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in limited or enhanced settings. When histologic-based diagnosis cannot be obtained, a CA 125 to carcinoembryonic antigen ratio ≥ 25 can support ovarian cancer as the primary diagnosis. Clinicians with laparoscopic training in oncology surgical care may use laparoscopy for limited indications.

### National fluid shifts: fifteen-year trends in paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures [^111h8iwn]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate national trends in paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures and the relative roles of specialty groups providing these services.

Methods

Medicare Physician Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 1993 to 2008 were analyzed for paracentesis and thoracentesis procedure codes. Using physician specialty identifier codes, procedure volumes were extracted for radiologists, primary care physicians, and surgeons for both procedures. Volume data were extracted for gastroenterologists and pulmonary and critical care medicine physicians, respectively, for paracentesis and thoracentesis. Frequency by site of service was similarly evaluated. Relative changes were calculated.

Results

Between 1993 and 2008, paracentesis procedures on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries increased by 133% (from 64,371 to 149,699), and thoracentesis procedures decreased by 14% (from 147,363 to 127,444). Services by radiologists increased by 964% (from 10,456 to 111,275) and 358% (from 14,531 to 66,602), respectively, while all other targeted groups experienced declines. For paracentesis, radiologist and gastroenterologist procedure shares changed from 16% and 32%, respectively, in 1993 to 74% and 6% in 2008. For thoracentesis, radiologist and pulmonary and critical care medicine physician shares changed from 10% and 49% to 52% and 27%. Relative shifts in site of service to the hospital outpatient setting occurred for both procedures.

Conclusions

Since 1993, paracentesis procedures on Medicare beneficiaries have more than doubled, while thoracentesis volumes have declined slightly. Radiologists now far exceed gastroenterologists and pulmonary and critical care medicine physicians, respectively, as the predominant providers of these services. Those shifts are likely attributable to both the incremental safety of imaging guidance and also the unfavorable economics of these procedures.

### Malignant pleural disease: a pragmatic guide to diagnosis [^111Vybmc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis of malignant pleural disease is important in the care of patients with cancer. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to diagnosis may lead to delays in care as the sensitivity of each biopsy modality varies and can be dependent on the tumor type. We review current literature on pleural biopsy techniques and propose a diagnostic algorithm for suspected malignant pleural disease.

Recent Findings

Recent literature has shown that the sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology varies based on tumor type resulting in a limited value of repeated thoracenteses in many cases. Furthermore, the ability to test for molecular biomarkers on pleural fluid samples has contributed to the recommendations to send large volumes of pleural fluid for analysis. Studies have also supported the consideration of medical thoracoscopy earlier in the diagnostic work-up of malignant pleural disease.

Summary

The decision to repeat a diagnostic thoracentesis when suspecting malignant pleural effusions should take into account the primary tumor type. Open pleural biopsy with medical thoracoscopy has been shown to be a relatively safe diagnostic modality with high sensitivity and should be considered in patients with a nondiagnostic thoracentesis.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^1174vCXT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AGA best practice advice 4 — in all patients with AKI, a rigorous search for infection is required; a diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; blood and urine cultures and chest radiograph are also required; there is no role for routine prophylactic antibiotics in patients with AKI, but broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started whenever infection is strongly suspected.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114qbwPX]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology in collaboration with British Association for the Study of the Liver has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the evidence that guides clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007. These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and comprise systematic reviews in the key areas, including the diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis are available, these have been updated with additional studies. In addition, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included. Where possible, judgement has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines and the specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practising clinicians, and it is expected that these guidelines will be revised in 3 years' time.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites… [^113FgLPp]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

First, the potential association of the daily amount of ascites drained on the incidence of hyponatremia, AKI, and severe AKI was analyzed. The Youden-Index was used to identify an optimal cutoff to estimate occurrence of complications within 90 days. Categorical data were analyzed using χ² or McNemar testing, respectively. PSM was performed with nearest neighbor matching and a caliper of 0.
25. Standardized mean differences were used to assess balance before and after matching. Time-to-event analysis was conducted with Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis or log-rank testing. Using the Youden-Index, a cutoff of 1. 5 L/d was identified to estimate any complication within 90-day. The cutoff of 1. 5 L/d or more was used for further analysis.

All patients with daily paracentesis of 1. 5 L/d or more were matched with the SOC cohort. Patients in the group with drainage of 1. 5 L/d or more received significantly less albumin per liter ascites drained within 90 days compared with the SOC cohort. Besides the increased incidence of clinical end points in patients with drainage of 1. 5 L/d or more, we observed a significant decrease of serum sodium while leucocyte count and C-reactive protein increased in patients with taps of

1. 5 L/d or more after 28 days, similar to patients undergoing LVP without albumin infusion. 10, 24 Interestingly, this was not the case in patients with daily drainage of 1. 5 L/d or less. In conclusion, our data indicate that the risk of clinical complications in those performing repeated low-volume paracentesis without albumin substitution is associated with the volume drained per day. Drainage of 1.

5 L/d or more associates with a higher risk for hyponatremia, AKI, and increasing inflammation while those with drainage of less than

1. 5 L/d show comparable complication rates with those receiving SOC.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113snnRy]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong)
Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Q uality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^1137WuCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis

Paracentesis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic ascites and has a therapeutic effect on patients. The diagnostic criteria for pancreatic ascites include an amylase concentration > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level of > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) < 1.1 g/dL. First proposed by Dr. John C. Hoefs in 1981, SAAG can help clinicians determine whether ascites is due to portal hypertension or to other causes. The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum concentration. SAAG > 1.1 g/dL is transudative in nature and indicates portal hypertension etiology, which may include cirrhosis, heart failure, portal vein occlusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In contrast, an SAAG < 1.1 g/dL is considered exudative, insidious, and often due to peritoneal disease. Common causes include infectious peritonitis, chylous ascites, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome and pancreatic ascites. However, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL alone is not diagnostic for either condition.

Similarly to amylase and albumin levels, lipase enzyme level tends to be elevated in pancreatic ascites. Lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated in pancreatic ascites; however, it can also be elevated in malignant ascites and tuberculous peritonitis. Tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 125 help rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignancy. Fluid cytology and culture are usually negative in pancreatic ascites, particularly in the absence of abscesses or infected pseudocysts. Pancreatic ascites is typically straw-colored in appearance, although isolated cases of black or bloody ascites have also been reported.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111LFMS9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bedside paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure across various patient care settings. Overall, this is considered a safe procedure with a low likelihood of complication rates, estimated to be less than 2%. Given the low prevalence of complications, outcomes data from different settings is often combined to reach statistical power to detect factors contributing to adverse outcomes or complications. This could miss certain clinical factors unique to hospitalized patients.

Additionally, some outcomes data from older studies were published before current standards regarding IV albumin infusion or point‐of‐care ultrasound coalesced. Few studies investigate the experience of primary operator, which could also have an effect on procedural risk. Furthermore, outcomes data also precede the adoption of medicine procedure services (MPS).

While complication rates from paracenteses are low, it can be fatal or life‐threatening, requiring additional procedures. A systematic review noted 40% of hemorrhagic complications required a surgical (35%) or IR (65%) intervention, with mortality rates as high as 43% from paracentesis‐associated hemorrhage. Additionally, some complications can be days to a week after paracentesis in rare instances, which may lead to missed detection and underestimate true complication rates.

We aimed to evaluate complication rates and outcomes of paracentesis in patients in the inpatient setting of a large tertiary transplantation center. We included patients with decompensated cirrhosis with high MELD scores that are at a perceived higher risk of procedural complications. We also included patients with other reasons for ascites, including cardiogenic ascites, which is not captured in prior literature. Additionally, we evaluated operator outcomes data from our MPS, consisting of residents and a supervising hospitalist attending, who perform bedside procedures utilizing a standardized technique.

### Practice patterns, diagnostic utility, and safety of anterior chamber paracentesis [^112y8r4i]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the safety and diagnostic utility of anterior chamber (AC) paracentesis in patients with ocular inflammation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Design

This was a 2-part study including a cross-sectional survey study to assess practice patterns on AC paracentesis and a retrospective diagnostic and safety study of all outpatient AC paracentesis performed between April 2012 and March 2023 at UCSF.

Participants

The participants of the practice patterns survey study were ophthalmologists in the Proctor Foundation listserv. All patients who underwent at least 1 outpatient AC paracentesis at UCSF from 2012 to 2023 were included in the retrospective diagnostic and safety investigation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

For the diagnostic and safety study, the main outcomes included the frequency of adverse events and positive results for pathogens on various aqueous fluid testing.

Results

In our survey study, most providers had fellowship training in cornea and/or uveitis (68%) and performed AC paracentesis with the patient at the slit lamp (75%). Our retrospective diagnostic and safety study included 386 patients (51.3% female, mean age 56.7 years) and 528 AC paracentesis. Complications occurred in 5.7% of AC paracentesis. The overall PCR-positivity was 24.2% (97/401) and highest for cytomegalovirus (56/386; 14.5%). On multivariable analysis, topical corticosteroids increased the odds of PCR-positivity for viral pathogens (P = 0.01-.02). High AC cell levels were also associated with increased odds of PCR-positivity for HSV/VZV (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Results of our study demonstrated the safety and diagnostic utility of AC paracentesis. This procedure facilitated the diagnosis of infectious causes of uveitis in almost 25% of cases.

### Specialties performing paracentesis procedures at university hospitals: implications for training and certification [^115hK7aN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Paracentesis procedure competency is not required for internal medicine or family medicine board certification, and national data show these procedures are increasingly referred to interventional radiology (IR). However, practice patterns at university hospitals are less clear.

Objective

To evaluate which specialties perform paracentesis procedures at university hospitals, compare characteristics of patients within each specialty, and evaluate length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs.

Design, Setting, Patients

Observational administrative database review of patients with liver disease who underwent paracentesis procedures in hospitals participating in the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) Database from January 2010 through December 2012. UHC is an alliance of 120 academic medical centers and their 290 affiliated hospitals.

Exposure

Patients with liver disease who underwent inpatient paracentesis procedures.

Measurements

We compared characteristics of patients who underwent paracentesis procedures by physician specialty, modeling the effects of patient characteristics on the likelihood of IR referral. We also analyzed LOS and hospital costs among patients with a > 20% predicted probability of IR referral.

Results

There were 97,577 paracentesis procedures performed during 70,862 hospital stays in 204 hospitals. IR performed 29% of paracenteses versus 49% by medicine and medicine subspecialties including gastroenterology/hepatology. Patients who were female, obese, and those with lower severity of illness were more likely to be referred to IR. Patients with a medicine or gastroenterology/hepatology paracentesis had a similar LOS compared to IR. Hospital costs were an estimated as $1308 less for medicine and $803 less for gastroenterology/hepatology compared to admissions with IR procedures (both P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Internal medicine- and family medicine-trained clinicians frequently perform paracentesis procedures on complex inpatients but are not currently required to be competent in the procedure. Increasing bedside paracentesis procedures may reduce healthcare costs.

### Disparities over time in volume, day of the week, and patient complexity between paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures performed by radiologists versus those performed by nonradiologists [^114heF5s]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the disparities between the paracenteses and thoracenteses performed by radiologists with those performed by nonradiologists over time. Variables included the volume of procedures, the days of the week, and the complexity of the patient's condition.

Materials and Methods

Using carrier claims files for a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2004 to 2016, paracentesis and thoracentesis examinations were retrospectively classified by physician specialty (radiologist vs nonradiologist), day of the week (weekday vs weekend), and the complexity of the patient's condition (using Charlson comorbidity index scores). The Pearson chi-square and independent samples t-test were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Between 2004 and 2016, the proportion of all paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures performed by radiologists increased from 70% to 80% and from 47% to 66%, respectively. Although radiologists increasingly performed more of both services on both weekends and weekdays, the share performed by radiologists was lower on weekends. For most of the first 9 years across the study period, radiologists performed paracentesis in patients with more complex conditions than those treated by nonradiologists, but the complexity of patients' conditions was similar during recent years. For thoracentesis, the complexity of patients' conditions was similar for both specialty groups across the study period.

Conclusions

The proportion of paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures performed in Medicare beneficiaries by radiologists continues to increase, with radiologists increasingly performing most of both services on weekends. Nonetheless, radiologists perform disproportionately more on weekdays than on weekends. Presently, radiologists and nonradiologists perform paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures in patients with similarly complex conditions. These interspecialty differences in timing and complexity of the patient's condition differ from those recently described for several diagnostic imaging services, reflecting the unique clinical and referral patterns for invasive versus diagnostic imaging services.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^113kZSZu]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hunt for precipitants or triggers — A preferred approach

There is considerable overlap between precipitants of HE and factors contributing to non‐HEs. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline recommends broad consideration of infection, electrolyte derangements, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage as potential sources for decompensation. In patients with ascites, diagnostic paracentesis remains a critical part of diagnostic workup and should be performed promptly after the presentation. Given the high rate of morbidity and mortality from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, previous studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of death associated with early paracentesis in patients admitted with ascites. However, paracentesis can be especially challenging to obtain in the first 24 h of admission for many reasons. Encephalopathy itself may limit patients' ability to consent to a procedure or maintain positioning/sterility while paracentesis is being performed. Staffing limitations and level of training may also limit the ability to perform paracentesis in the first hours after admission. One retrospective analysis of patients admitted for HE noted that 77% did not have diagnostic paracentesis during their admission. Blood cultures should generally be performed on admission as part of a broad infectious workup. Chest radiographs and urinalysis may also be considered, although are not always warranted in those patients who are able to provide negative infectious history for these systems and have no concerning physical exam findings. Gastrointestinal bleeding, typically apparent in the history, may be more challenging to elucidate in encephalopathic patients. Although many metabolic derangements potentially driving HE can be readily seen on a basic metabolic panel, hypovolemia (a potential HE precipitant) may be challenging to identify as many patients with cirrhosis have third spacing on physical exam. Hence, astute clinical assessment is most important for making these judgment calls. If the clinical situation demands, it may be prudent to consult the Hepatology or Gastrointestinal services, if available. Table 1 shows some of the representative precipitants for HE.

### Abdominal paracentesis… [^113MXKL3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The normal abdominal cavity has a small amount of fluid. Cirrhosis with associated portal hypertension. is the most common cause of ascites. Other causes of ascites include cancer, heart failure, kidney failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. An abdominal paracentesis involves the surgical puncture of the abdominal cavity with a needle and placement of a catheter line for the removal of excess fluid. The procedure can be diagnostic in helping identify the cause of ascites or may be used as a therapeutic measure if a large volume of fluid can be removed to lessen discomfort and improve breathing. The March 12. 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about paracentesis techniques. It identifies ways to decrease the risk of complications and to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Patients with new-onset ascites Patients with chronic ascites and at least one of the following symptoms: Fever Abdominal pain Increasing ascites volume — increasing abdominal girth. Unexplained encephalopathy Declining liver function Kidney failure With current techniques, diagnostic paracentesis is considered a safe procedure. Some coagulopathies may make the procedure too risky to perform. Pregnancy, organomegaly, severe bowel or bladder distention, and previous abdominal-pelvic surgery may increase the risk of the procedure. In those situations, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be considered. Procedural complications are rare but can include.

Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid Circulatory problems, such as lowered blood pressure Localized infection at the puncture site Abdominal wall blood clots or bruises Bleeding Injury to organs in the abdomen Tests of the removed fluid help to establish the cause of the ascites and to rule out infection. These tests include counts of the numbers and types of cells in the fluid. Testing for albumin should be done in cases of new ascites. Additional tests may be done depending on the patient's history and physical examination.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131FfV3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) response assessment and duration are specified as follows: it is recommended that a diagnostic paracentesis (or thoracentesis for SBE) be performed 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy to assess response, and a negative response is defined by a decrease in PMN count < 25% from baseline that should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days, although a small study found therapy was shorter when discontinued once PMN decreased to < 250/mm³ (mean, 4.8 days) compared with empirically determined duration (mean, 9.6 days). Patients with ascites PMN < 250/mm³ and a positive bacteriological culture (bacterascites) without signs of infection should not receive antibiotics, and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to investigate progression to SBP, while repeat paracentesis/thoracentesis may be unnecessary if an organism is isolated, is susceptible, and the patient is improving clinically.

### Emergency medicine updates: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113zjcZu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm³ is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^11323TsT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

HRS-AKI — diagnostic investigations emphasize bland urine, daily creatinine monitoring, infection workup, and limited need for pelvic ultrasound. "Patients with HRS-AKI have bland urine microscopic examination but do not respond with return of serum creatinine to ≤ 0.3 mg/dL of baseline to fluid challenge alone". Infection evaluation is advised: "Infection should be ruled out by careful physical examination for evidence of cellulitis and pneumonia and by investigations including chest radiography, urine and blood cultures, and diagnostic paracentesis for exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the most common cause of HRS-AKI". For monitoring, "Serum creatinine is measured daily to assess AKI stage". Imaging notes that "Small echogenic kidneys on ultrasonography indicate structural renal disease, but a pelvic ultrasound is usually not needed, as postrenal obstruction is an uncommon cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis".

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult abdominal paracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^116ghThQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used for paracentesis to reduce the risk of serious complications, the most common being bleeding. 2. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to avoid attempting paracentesis in patients with an insufficient volume of intraperitoneal free fluid to drain. 3. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used with paracentesis to improve the success rates of the overall procedure. 4. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to assess the volume and location of intraperitoneal free fluid to guide clinical decision making of where paracentesis can be safely performed. 5. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify a needle insertion site based on size of the fluid collection, thickness of the abdominal wall, and proximity to abdominal organs. 6. We recommend that the needle insertion site should be evaluated using color flow Doppler ultrasound to identify and avoid abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 7. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be evaluated in multiple planes to ensure clearance from underlying abdominal organs and detect any abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 8. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be marked with ultrasound immediately before performing the procedure, and the patient should remain in the same position between marking the site and performing the procedure. 9. We recommend that using real-time ultrasound guidance for paracentesis should be considered when the fluid collection is small or difficult to access. 10. We recommend that dedicated training sessions, including didactics, supervised practice on patients, and simulation-based practice, should be used to teach novices how to perform ultrasound-guided paracentesis. 11. We recommend that simulation-based practice should be used, when available, to facilitate acquisition of the required knowledge and skills to perform ultrasoundguided paracentesis. 12. We recommend that competence in performing ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be demonstrated prior to independently performing the procedure on patients.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^1145FVu5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure with overall risks cited around 1‐2%. We aimed to focus on risks associated with post‐paracentesis AKI and bleeding as the most studied complications. We did not investigate the incidence of other complications given low rate of occurrence (one perforation in our cohort), and we typically utilize surgical glue prophylactically to minimize ascites and anasarca leak, which would affect overall incidence.

Prior studies have shown that there is a 5%–10% risk of developing AKI with increased risk associated with higher MELD score and younger age. Our study identified a similar risk of AKI (10%–12%) and found an association with a higher MELD‐Na score but no association with respect to age. It has previously been found that there is a 1.24× risk for each liter of fluid drained, but we did not find any correlation between volume removed and AKI. We did find that patients with clinical deterioration as an indication for paracentesis were at higher risk of developing AKI post‐paracentesis. Although we did not collect data regarding IV albumin administration, a strength of this study is that our institution strictly follows the AASLD guidelines for albumin administration, which is further reinforced by our MPS postprocedure. Our findings support that paracentesis, regardless of volume, is well tolerated by the kidneys when guideline‐recommended albumin repletion is used, but clinicians should weigh the risk of AKI against the symptomatic relief provided by therapeutic paracentesis in the clinically deteriorating patient.

Serious hemorrhagic complications of paracentesis have been seen both with LVP and diagnostic paracentesis and are categorized into three groups: abdominal wall hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and hemoperitoneum. Mallory and Schaefer evaluated 242 diagnostic abdominal paracenteses in patients with liver disease and reported four patients with serious hemorrhagic complications (1.7%), which was significantly higher than previously published data. McVay and Toy reviewed 608 procedures in 395 patients and found the incidence of significant bleeding (defined as more than a 2 g/dL drop) was 3.1%. Delayed bleeding has also been described and could be due to rapid decompression of splanchnic circulation related to a sudden decrease in intraabdominal pressure leading to increased portal pressures and varix rupture. Higher rates of bleeding have been seen in patients with higher Child‐Pugh and MELD scores. Previous studies have also found a significant association between AKI and bleeding risk.

### Quality improvement project demonstrating a sustained increase in the assessment and sampling of ascites for hospitalised patients with cirrhosis [^1136rhhV]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Using quality improvement techniques, we aimed to improve the rate of assessment and sampling of ascitic fluid for the purpose of diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospitalist service of our institution.

Design/Methods

Based on stakeholder needs assessment, we implemented interventions targeting provider knowledge, procedure workflows and clinical decision support. We analysed key metrics during preintervention (September-December 2020), intervention roll-out (January-April 2021), postintervention (May-September 2021) and sustainability (September-December 2022) periods for admissions of patients with cirrhosis to our hospitalist service at Maine Medical Center, a 700-bed tertiary-care academic hospital in Portland, Maine, USA.

Results

Among patients with cirrhosis admitted to our service, documentation of assessment for paracentesis increased from a preintervention baseline of 60.1% to 93.5% (p < 0.005) postintervention. For patients with ascites potentially amenable to paracentesis, diagnostic paracentesis rate increased from 59.7% to 93% (p < 0.005), with the rate of paracentesis within 24 hours increasing from 52.6% to 77.2% (p = 0.01). These improvements persisted during our sustainability period. Complication rate was low (1.2%) across all study periods.

Conclusion

Our quality improvement project led to a sustained improvement in the identification of patients with cirrhosis needing diagnostic paracentesis and an increased procedure completion rate. This improvement strategy serves as a model for needed work toward closing a national performance gap for patients with cirrhosis.

### The diagnostic utility of anterior chamber paracentesis with polymerase chain reaction in anterior uveitis [^113pMfsh]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the value of anterior chamber paracentesis with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with anterior uveitis.

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Setting

Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.

Patient Population

Fifty-three patients with a diagnosis of anterior uveitis who underwent anterior chamber paracentesis with PCR.

Observation Procedures

Anterior chamber paracentesis with PCR of aqueous fluid.

Main Outcome Measure

Diagnostic utility and frequency of management change based on anterior chamber paracentesis and PCR.

Results

There were 15 of 53 (28%) acute and 35 of 53 (65%) chronic anterior uveitis patients. PCR positivity of herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus in our population were 4 of 53 (8%), 1 of 47 (2%), 1 of 35 (3%), and 1 of 18 (6%). Overall, 7 of 53 patients (13%) had a change in management because of PCR results from anterior chamber paracentesis. Four patients encountered paracentesis complications (4/53, 7.5%), 1 with long-term sequelae.

Conclusions

Anterior chamber paracentesis with PCR had a relatively low diagnostic utility and resulted in few management changes in patients with suspected infectious anterior uveitis.

Pediatric cirrhosis with ascites — initial management and paracentesis support are specified as follows: Children with cirrhosis and ascites should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation (LT). Ascites in children is initially managed with restricted sodium intake to below 2 mmol/kg per day and administration of spironolactone (1–4 mg/kg per day) and furosemide (1–3 mg/kg per day in divided doses). Children undergoing large-volume paracentesis (LVP) should receive 25% albumin infusion of 0.5–1.0 g/kg, or 6–8 g per liter of ascites removed. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in children with ascites and fever, abdominal pain, or clinical deterioration.

### Quality improvement initiative increases total paracentesis and early paracentesis rates in hospitalised cirrhotics with ascites [^111MDNm1]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Early paracentesis (EP) for rapid diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is considered best practice in the care of admitted patients with cirrhosis and ascites, but inpatient paracentesis is frequently not performed or delayed. We developed a quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed at increasing the proportion of admitted patients with cirrhosis who undergo paracentesis and EP.

Design

Pre-post study of a QI initiative.

Setting

A tertiary care hospital in a major metropolitan area.

Patients

Hospitalised patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Interventions

We targeted care providers in the emergency department (ED) by raising awareness of the importance of EP, developing criteria to identify patients at highest risk of SBP who were prioritised for EP by ED providers and restructuring the ED environment to enable timely paracentesis.

Results

76 patients meeting inclusion criteria were admitted during the postintervention 9-month study period. Of these, 91% (69/76) underwent paracentesis during admission versus 71% (77/109) preintervention (p = 0.001). 81% (56/69) underwent EP within 12hours of presentation or after a predefined acceptable reason for delay versus 48% (37/77) preintervention (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality or length of stay before and after intervention.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary QI intervention targeting care in the ED successfully increased the proportion of patients with cirrhosis and ascites undergoing diagnostic paracentesis during admission and EP within 12hours of presentation.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^11249NgA]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

### Unusual complication of diagnostic abdominal paracentesis… [^114PU2cA]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

IN RECENT YEARS, numerous reports have appeared in the literature on the use of diagnostic paracentesis, particularly in cases of abdominal trauma and acute disease requiring surgery. In these reports, complication rates have been low and the use of this technique has been strongly advocated. Recently, we have encountered a patient in whom an erroneous diagnosis was made due to an abdominal paracentesis. It is our purpose to alert physicians to an error in technique that may lead to a false diagnosis and subsequent unnecessary laparotomy. Report of a Case A 20-year-old white man was admitted four hours after being involved in an automobile accident during which he was thrown against the steering wheel of his car. He had lost consciousness for approximately two minutes. Following the accident, the patient developed pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant and right anterior parts of the chest. He vomited once. Tindel S, Meyerowitz BR.

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure and generally considered to be low risk. Despite its overall favorable safety profile, use of ultrasound has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of complications, especially in higher risk patients. Many individual ultrasound techniques have been described in the literature, each with the goal of making paracentesis safer. This article presents a systematic approach for incorporating many of these tools into bedside practice and includes a series of illustrative figures and narrated video presentations to demonstrate the techniques described.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^114avLLk]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Manual chart review was performed to obtain additional retrospective data not captured in the prospective database. Demographic data collected included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). Descriptive data about the procedure included indication for paracentesis; etiology of ascites; whether the procedure was therapeutic and/or diagnostic; operator and supervisor; number of attempts; site of paracentesis, depth of pocket, and amount of fluid drained (see appendix). For the paracentesis indication of "clinical deterioration", we defined this as a change in vital signs (e.g. fever, new or worsening hypotension), altered mental status, worsening leukocytosis, and/or worsening renal function. Prior guidelines led to our use of > 5 L for the definition of LVP. Lab studies collected were serum sodium, liver function tests (AST, ALT, total bilirubin), renal function (normal, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or requiring dialysis), serum creatinine pre‐procedure and postprocedure, HGB pre‐ and postprocedure, platelets, PT/INR, and PTT all within 48 h of procedure.

Other patient factors that were collected included whether the patient was on anticoagulation, whether it was held for the procedure, and the use of antibiotics at the time of the procedure. Both immediate and delayed complications were noted, including AKI, receiving a blood transfusion within 48 h postprocedure, and death during admission. Chart reviews were used to discern whether deaths (within 7 days of procedure) and hemorrhagic complications (HGB drop by ≥ 2 g/dL) were attributable to the procedure. Reviewers considered whether an imaging or diagnostic procedure was performed to confirm the source of hemorrhage, whether an alternate source of bleeding was documented, and whether the patient required ICU‐level care within 48 h postprocedure. If answers to these questions were insufficient to identify if the hemorrhage was related to the procedure, we considered whether alternate explanations of a drop in HGB (i.e. albumin infusions, hemodilution) are as likely to be the cause as the procedure. When reviewing patients in our study period for predictors of HGB drop, all researchers performing chart review followed a standardized protocol that was created to ensure consistency in data collection.

### Delayed paracentesis is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^1168tprL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with high mortality. Early paracentesis (EP) is essential for rapid diagnosis and optimal treatment. The aim of the study is to compare the outcomes of patients with SBP who received EP vs. delayed paracentesis (DP).

Methods

Consecutive patients who were diagnosed with SBP (ascites neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ and clinical evidence of cirrhosis) < 72h from the first physician encounter at two centers were identified. EP was defined by receiving paracentesis < 12h and DP 12–72h from hospitalization. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

Results

The mean age of 239 patients with SBP was 53 ± 10 years; mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22 ± 9. In all, 98 (41%) patients who received DP had a higher in-hospital mortality (27% vs. 13%, P = 0.007) compared with 141 (59%) who received EP. Furthermore, DP group had longer intensive care days (4.0 ± 9.5 vs. 1.3 ± 4.1, P = 0.008), hospital days (13.0 ± 14.7 vs. 8.4 ± 7.4, P = 0.005), and higher 3-month mortality (28/76, 37% vs. 21/98, 21%; P = 0.03) compared with the EP group. Adjusting for MELD score ≥ 22 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8–18.5) and creatinine levels ≥ 1.5mg/dl (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.4–7.2), DP was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.3–4.8). Each hour delay in paracentesis was associated with a 3.3% (95% CI = 1.3–5.4%) increase in in-hospital mortality after adjusting for MELD score and creatinine levels.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with SBP who received DP had a 2.7-fold increased risk of mortality adjusting for MELD score and renal dysfunction. Diagnostic paracentesis performed < 12h from hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis and ascites may improve short-term survival.

### The untapped potential of ascites in ovarian cancer research and treatment [^111hBTmD]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

A challenge to be overcome when considering further work with this sample type is the variable capturing of ascites in tumour biobanks and clinical databases. Ascites and its contents are not routinely stored for downstream analysis in biorepositories, and volumes are often inconsistently recorded. As such, the possibility of retrospective or large-scale analysis of ascites samples is, at this stage, limited. However, an increased awareness of the potential of this substrate for research might encourage more comprehensive documentation and cataloguing of this valuable sample, which will serve to enhance research possibilities as they advance. Another challenge when working with ascites is that sample transfer to researchers might be prone to delay, as the samples are retrieved secondary to a patient's therapeutic paracentesis. As such, it is crucial to consider how the integrity of the samples is affected by time, to ensure that valid research can be performed. A standardised protocol for handling this unique biospecimen is warranted. Meeting these challenges will allow us to harness the full potential of this ascites and might provide the key for improving outcomes for this devastating disease.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
