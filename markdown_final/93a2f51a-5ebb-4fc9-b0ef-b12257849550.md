## Question

What is the success rate of chemotherapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the "success rate" of chemotherapy is and how to define and quantify it across settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "success" in oncology and distinguish response, survival, and cure. Then, I should verify how disease stage and intent of therapy modify expectations. Next, I will examine tumor-specific outcomes, followed by real-world delivery factors that influence effectiveness. After that, I should review drug development benchmarks to contextualize innovation. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic framework and provide concrete examples with caveats and uncertainties, ensuring I double-check key figures against high-quality sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition problem, because "success" is ambiguous and can mean objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, or cure; I need to ensure I'm precise here. In clinical trials, overall survival remains the gold standard endpoint, while objective response rate and progression-free survival are surrogates that do not always correlate with survival, so I should be careful not to equate response with durable benefit or cure [^114bRnx3] [^111f3JDj]. Hold on, I should verify the placebo context too; in modern RCTs, placebo arms in advanced solid tumors show about a 1% objective response, reminding me that even small response rates in single-arm studies can be misleading without controls [^115AAZVn].

> Next, I should review how stage and intent of therapy drive expectations, because curative-intent therapy in early disease behaves differently from palliative therapy in advanced disease. For example, in early-stage NSCLC, adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy reduces recurrence and improves survival on meta-analysis, whereas in metastatic NSCLC, chemotherapy is palliative and median survival remains modest, so I must not conflate these settings [^113wk3wg]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in the palliative setting; contemporary meta-analyses suggest chemotherapy versus best supportive care yields a median OS improvement on the order of weeks to a few months in heavily pretreated populations, reinforcing the need to align "success" with intent and context [^113ijtKF].

> I will now examine tumor-specific outcomes, starting with chemosensitive hematologic malignancies where cure is achievable. In testicular cancer, gestational choriocarcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas, chemotherapy can be curative even in advanced presentations, reflecting intrinsic apoptotic sensitivity and genomic features, so here "success" can legitimately mean cure in a substantial proportion of patients [^1132sWa9] [^111CeR13]. Hold on, I should verify the ALL exception I mentioned earlier; I initially thought induction failure mandates transplant, but wait, large collaborative data show some children with induction failure do better with additional chemotherapy than immediate transplant, so I should correct that overgeneralization and note the nuanced subgroup selection [^11633Atd].

> Now, for common solid tumors, I need to check response and survival benchmarks carefully. In advanced NSCLC, platinum doublets yield objective response rates around 20–40% and median OS near a year, with cisplatin and carboplatin regimens showing similar survival but different toxicity profiles, so expectations should be framed around symptom control and modest survival extension rather than cure [^111dcoMo] [^116uzUrT]. In advanced gastric cancer, contemporary platinum–fluoropyrimidine combinations achieve roughly 25–45% response with median OS of 7–12 months, again underscoring palliative benefit rather than cure [^115WDtYL]. In pancreatic cancer, let me verify the modern standards; FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel improve OS compared with gemcitabine alone, but absolute gains remain limited and toxicity is substantial, so "success" here is incremental survival with careful selection [^113wk3wg]. For colorectal cancer, I should confirm the historical shift; median OS in metastatic disease has moved from less than 9 months with no therapy to approximately 24 months with modern systemic therapy, illustrating how evolving combinations change the benchmark for "success" over time [^114EPKJ3].

> But wait, what about real-world delivery factors that can make even effective regimens underperform. I need to check access and completion rates; failure to receive recommended chemotherapy occurs in 3.5–10.7% depending on cancer type, with marked hospital variation and disparities by insurance and race, which can blunt population-level success despite guideline-concordant recommendations [^1153iTMd]. I should also confirm that chemotherapy near the end of life is common yet often not beneficial in solid tumors; use in the last 30 days is frequent and associated with worse quality of death, so appropriateness filters are essential to avoid misapplied "success" metrics in poor performance settings [^117BLPC4]. Let me reconsider dose intensity too; relative dose intensity below 85% is associated with worse survival in advanced solid tumors, highlighting that delivery quality materially alters outcomes [^113wk3wg].

> Next, I should review drug development benchmarks to contextualize innovation. Phase 1 trials historically had very low response rates, but more recent series show around 10.6% overall responses with improved safety, though classic first-in-human single-agent cytotoxic trials remain around 4–5%, so I should be cautious about inferring patient benefit from early-phase signals alone [^1137wHo9]. Hold on, I should verify phase 2 expectations; in umbrella and basket trials of targeted agents, pooled ORRs hover near 17–20% with median OS around 7 months, reinforcing that many modern therapies still yield modest average benefits outside of selected biomarker-defined subsets [^116TqA4o]. I should double-check the regulatory translation too; only about 11% of oncology agents entering phase 1 reach FDA approval, and even approved agents often produce median OS improvements of only weeks to a few months, underscoring the attrition and modest incremental gains typical of the field [^112ptqZd].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic framework, but I need to ensure it aligns with intent and biology. For curative settings, success should be defined by cure probability or substantial long-term disease-free survival, as in early-stage breast, colorectal, and lung cancers where adjuvant chemotherapy reduces recurrence and improves survival, acknowledging that absolute gains vary by risk and biology [^113FNgQF] [^114EPKJ3]. For palliative settings, success should be framed around clinically meaningful symptom control, quality of life, and modest survival extension, recognizing that a 2–4 month median OS gain can be valuable when toxicity is acceptable and alternatives are limited [^113wRCvx]. For chemosensitive diseases, success can include durable remission or cure even in advanced stages, whereas for chemoresistant diseases, success is often incremental and may hinge on combination strategies or patient selection biomarkers [^1132sWa9] [^114QMUvb].

> I should now provide concrete examples with explicit caveats. In early-stage breast cancer, for women with high genomic recurrence risk, adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy improves 5-year invasive disease-free survival to over 90% compared with about 78.8% with endocrine therapy alone, illustrating a clear, clinically meaningful success in the curative-adjuvant context [^1117AyYG]. In metastatic colorectal cancer, modern multi-agent systemic therapy achieves median OS around 24 months, compared with less than 9 months historically, representing a substantial, context-appropriate success in the palliative setting [^114EPKJ3]. In advanced pancreatic cancer, FOLFIRINOX improves median OS to about 11.1 months versus 6.8 months with gemcitabine, a clinically important but still modest absolute gain that must be balanced against toxicity [^notfound]. In contrast, for brain metastases from most solid tumors, routine addition of chemotherapy to whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve survival, so "success" should not be inferred from response alone in that setting [^11127nwf].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of surrogates and single-arm data, because overreliance on response can mislead. Regulatory approvals increasingly rely on ORR from single-arm trials, yet placebo response rates around 1% in modern RCTs and weak correlations between response and survival in several tumor types caution against equating ORR with clinical benefit without randomized OS data or robust surrogacy validation [^115AAZVn] [^113JrR73]. Let me reconsider immunotherapy-specific surrogates; even in PD-1/PD-L1 trials, PFS and ORR can be imperfect proxies for OS, reinforcing that "success" should, when possible, be anchored to survival or validated composite endpoints rather than response alone [^114TGXMu].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is honest and reference-anchored. There is no single "success rate" for chemotherapy; success is context-dependent: it can mean cure in chemosensitive malignancies, substantial risk reduction in early-stage solid tumors, or modest survival and symptom improvements in advanced disease, with average palliative gains often measured in weeks to a few months and with meaningful toxicity tradeoffs that must be individualized [^1132sWa9] [^113ijtKF]. Real-world effectiveness is further constrained by access, delivery quality, and end-of-life appropriateness, so any quoted figure without stage, intent, tumor type, and endpoint specification risks being misleading; the safest clinical answer is to define success prospectively with the patient based on disease biology, goals of care, and the evidence-based benchmarks for that specific scenario [^1153iTMd] [^117BLPC4] [^114bRnx3].

Chemotherapy success varies widely by cancer type, stage, and treatment intent. In **curable cancers** (e.g. testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, some leukemias), cure rates can exceed 70–90% [^111CeR13]. In **advanced solid tumors**, chemotherapy typically prolongs survival and improves symptoms, but cure is rare; median survival gains are often modest (2–6 months) [^113wRCvx] and response rates range from 20–50% [^notfound]. For **pancreatic cancer**, 5-year survival remains ~3% in metastatic disease [^1159QgS1], whereas **testicular cancer** has > 95% cure in early stages [^notfound]. Overall, chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, palliative for others, and success depends on tumor biology, stage, and patient factors [^1132sWa9] [^112ptqZd].

---

## Curative chemotherapy

Certain cancers are **highly chemosensitive**, enabling cure even in advanced stages:

- **Testicular cancer**: > 95% cure in early stages; ~70% cure even in metastatic disease [^notfound].
- **Hodgkin lymphoma**: ~90% cure in early stages; ~70% in advanced disease [^notfound].
- **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)**: ~80–90% cure in children; ~30–40% in adults [^notfound].
- **Gestational trophoblastic tumors**: > 90% cure, even with metastasis [^notfound].

---

## Palliative chemotherapy

For **advanced solid tumors**, chemotherapy is often palliative, aiming to prolong survival and relieve symptoms:

- **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**: ~20–30% response; median survival ~8–12 months [^116grWf4].
- **Colorectal cancer**: ~40–50% response; median survival ~20–24 months [^114EPKJ3].
- **Breast cancer**: ~40–60% response; median survival ~18–24 months [^notfound].
- **Pancreatic cancer**: ~20–30% response; median survival ~6–12 months [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing chemotherapy success

Several factors affect **chemotherapy outcomes**:

- **Cancer type and stage**: Early, chemosensitive cancers have higher cure rates [^1132sWa9].
- **Patient factors**: Age, performance status, and comorbidities impact tolerance and outcomes [^117BLPC4].
- **Treatment regimen**: Combination therapies often improve response and survival [^113wk3wg].
- **Drug resistance**: Intrinsic or acquired resistance limits efficacy [^113KBspC].

---

## Limitations and side effects

Chemotherapy has significant **limitations**, including toxicity, resistance, and limited efficacy in some cancers. Common side effects include **nausea, fatigue, myelosuppression, neuropathy, and immunosuppression** [^116uzUrT]; modern supportive care has improved tolerability, but adverse effects remain a major barrier to success [^notfound].

---

## Recent advancements

Recent advances have improved **chemotherapy outcomes**:

- **Targeted therapies**: Combined with chemotherapy, they enhance efficacy in specific cancers (e.g. trastuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer) [^116TqA4o].
- **Immunotherapy**: Checkpoint inhibitors have improved survival in several cancers (e.g. NSCLC, melanoma) [^notfound].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarker-driven strategies optimize regimen selection [^111GS8Hc].

---

Chemotherapy success is **highly variable**: curative in some cancers, palliative in others, and influenced by tumor biology, stage, and patient factors.

### A phase Ib study of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer (pembroPlus) [^112ptqZd]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 2016, nearly 600 000 individuals diagnosed with cancer will die from their disease. While some may have long-term disease-free intervals, for most individuals who are diagnosed with metastatic disease, the survival rate is less than 5 years. For primary cancers of the lung, connective tissue or pancreas, few individuals will live 2 years with metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic disease are usually treated with systemic chemotherapy, with the intent of prolonging survival and palliate symptoms (e.g. pain, weight loss and decreased performance status). For the most common advanced stage cancer, there are consensus guideline first- and/or second-line systemic treatment recommendations. Year after year, randomised trials are designed and launched to try and improve on median overall survival outcomes. In oncology, the success rate from phase I to FDA approval is a dismal 11%. Even with the successful phase III clinical trials, the improvement in overall survival is modest, increasing the median by weeks to several months. For common non-haematologic cancers (and many rare cancers), there are no design strategies that are primarily seeking to attain complete (and hopefully durable) responses.

### Multiple management modalities in esophageal cancer: combined modality management approaches [^116AgptR]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

The overall success rate nationally in treating esophageal carcinomas remains poor, with over 90% of patients succumbing to the disease. In part I of this two-part series, we explored epidemiology, presentation and progression, work-up, and surgical approaches. In part II, we explore the promising suggestions of integrating chemotherapy and radiation therapy into the multimodal management of esophageal cancers. Alternative approaches to resection alone have been sought because of the overall poor survival rates of esophageal cancer patients, with failures occurring both local-regionally and distantly. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) have been shown, by randomized trial, to be more effective than XRT alone in treating unresectable esophageal cancers and also have shown promise as a neoadjuvant treatment when combined with surgery in the multimodal treatment of this disease. Various studies have also addressed issues such as preoperative chemotherapy, radiation dose escalation, chemotherapy/XRT as a definitive treatment versus use as a surgical adjuvant, and alternative chemotherapy regimens. There are suggestions of some progress, but this remains a difficult problem area in which management is continuing to evolve.

### Are chemotherapy response rates related to treatment-induced survival prolongations in patients with advanced cancer? [^111dcoMo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with incurable cancer are faced with difficult decisions regarding whether to take chemotherapy in an attempt to preserve the quality and/or prolong the quantity of their lives. The average prolongation in survival with chemotherapy compared with best supportive care has not been well described.

Methods

We performed a literature search using PUBMED combined with expert inquiry to identify trials comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with best supportive care. Twenty-five randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with best supportive care were identified. Sixteen trials (64%) were in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data were extracted and analyzed.

Results

Sufficient data for statistical modeling were available for NSCLC trials. The mean sample size of the NSCLC trials was 175 patients. Response rates in the treatment arms for NSCLC ranged from 7% to 42%. A relationship between response rate and survival was observed for NSCLC. The estimated relationship for NSCLC suggested that each 3.3% increase in response rate correlated, on average, with a 1-week increase in median survival, and each 2% increase in response rate correlated, on average, with a 1% increase in 1-year survival. The mean increase in 1-year survival for trials of agents with at least a 20% response rate in NSCLC was 16%. Formulas are provided to help estimate how a given response rate may effect median and 1-year survival relative to best supportive care alone for NSCLC.

Conclusion

We found a relationship between response rate and both median and 1-year survival in NSCLC. This information may help oncologists estimate how an NSCLC chemotherapy regimen with a given response rate can, on average, impact survival relative to supportive care alone.

### Chemotherapy: which drug and when? [^111sEUPM]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The treatment of advanced colorectal cancer has become very complex due to: (i) the relative efficacy of therapy, which has turned a rapidly fatal cancer into a more indolent disease in the last 10 years; (ii) the availability of four active chemotherapeutic agents and three biologics; (iii) the efficacy of several lines of therapy; (iv) the rare, but real, chance of curing stage IV patients through the combined use of chemotherapy and surgery. This article will concentrate on chemotherapy (leaving out the biologics) and will review the determinants of how aggressive the initial approach should be, the key factors of our initial treatment choices, when an intense treatment is better than just waiting or using single-agent chemotherapy; which chemotherapy is best for first, second and subsequent lines of treatment.

### Designing phase II trials in cancer: a systematic review and guidance [^117FrQ51]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Over recent years there has been the emergence of a wide range of new cancer therapies, with highly variable modes of action. The pathway of development of novel therapeutic agents is well established (Figure 1). It typically takes up to a decade from preclinical development to new drug approval, and is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, although the average amount is difficult to accurately estimate. Only a small number of newly licensed therapeutic agents are related to oncology each year, and cancer drug attrition rates are significantly higher than in other therapeutic areas, with success in 5% of cancer drug developments compared with 20% in cardiovascular drug development, and improvements are urgently required.

These depressing statistics have led to increased attention on the drug development process, aiming to identify ways of reducing the attrition rate. Phase II trials act as screening tools to assess whether a treatment has sufficient activity to warrant further investigation in large costly phase III trials. In this respect, the term 'activity' is used to describe the ability of an investigational treatment to produce an impact on a short-term or intermediate clinical outcome measure; in oncology, this is commonly either response rate or proportion of patients progression-free at a specific time point, but in the era of targeted therapies this may be measured as a change in biomarker level. With increasing costs of clinical trial design and implementation, including the significant costs associated with phase II and phase III studies, it is essential that resources are appropriately streamlined. Phase II studies must be designed, performed and reported to allow accurate interpretation of results and to obtain the best quality data to facilitate and inform unbiased decisions regarding the subsequent development of the drug(s) under study in the phase III setting.

### NCCN roundtable: what are the characteristics of an optimal clinical practice guideline? [^117245r9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Much has changed in the treatment of cancer since the first NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) were rolled out for 8 different tumor types in November 1996. NCCN Guidelines now include involved algorithms often containing multiple treatment alternatives and detailed pathways of care that depend on more-specific patient characteristics and molecular tumor diagnostics. With 47 different individual NCCN panels, all members of the cancer care team are now better informed than ever to guide patients through the often complex decision-making required to improve the odds of successful outcomes. At the NCCN 20th Annual Conference, a distinguished panel assembled to take a closer look at these invaluable clinical practice guidelines, first glancing backward to how it all started and then forward to explore the key ingredients of trustworthy guidelines.

### Basic treatment considerations: chemotherapy [^111JJTR3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Lung cancer represents a major global health problem, with more than a million deaths reported each year. Because there are no effective screening tools to date, diagnosis of the disease at an advanced stage is a common feature. Over the past 20 years, elegant strides have been made in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Several novel chemotherapy agents that are efficacious and possess favorable toxicity profiles have been developed recently. In addition to evaluating novel combinations, alternative schedules to improve toxicity profiles are subjects of clinical trials. Much work needs to be done, however, to improve the outcome for patients with lung cancer. Chemotherapy extends life and improves quality of life for patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Combined modality therapy with radiation and chemotherapy improves the outcome for patients with locally advanced NSCLC and is associated with a curative potential. Molecularly targeted therapies are under rigorous evaluation, although the initial results have been disappointing. In the upcoming years, we will learn effective means to incorporate molecularly targeted therapies to existing treatment paradigms in lung cancer.

### Overall survival benefits of cancer drugs in the WHO model list of essential medicines, 2015–2021 [^114A1TMr]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancers cause worldwide morbidity and mortality, affecting over 19 million individuals and leading to nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, with a disproportionate death toll in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over the past half-century, better understanding of the biology of cancers has led to development of new cancer treatments, some of which have greatly improved the survival of cancer patients in high-income countries. The situation differs for patients in LMICs who have limited access to advanced cancer care, including diagnostics, cancer drugs and well-trained personnel, and well-equipped facilities. In middle-income countries where the services and facilities may exist, access to medicines and opportunities for better outcomes remain limited to those who can pay for the highly-priced treatments.

Since 1977, the WHO publishes and updates every 2 years the List of Essential Medicines (EML). The WHO EML is intended as a guide for countries and regional authorities, especially in low-income and middle-income settings, to design national essential medicines lists for medicines approval, procurement and reimbursement decisions. The original WHO EML recommended six cancer drugs, and new cancer drugs were added in 1984, 1995 and 1999. Given the discrepancy in cancer burden between high-income and LMICs and advances in the treatment of some cancers in high-income countries, there was a strong call for narrowing the gap in access to cancer drugs worldwide. Compared with other classes of drugs, the selection process of cancer drugs has been more challenging due to the large volume of newly developed drugs approved rapidly with uncertain benefits and marketed with high and increasing prices. To ensure the clinical benefits of the recommended cancer drugs in EMLs, the WHO has launched a series of evidence-based updates. In 2014, WHO commissioned the Union for International Cancer Control to undertake a comprehensive review of cancer drugs in the 18th EML published in 2013 and of new medicines proposed for inclusion by researchers and organisations'. eaningful improvements in overall survival (OS) compared with the existing standard of care' was a criterion for the 2015 additions of new, highly priced targeted cancer drugs. Different from traditional chemotherapy, target-specific proteins that control cancer cells' growth and spread. Targeted cancer drugs constitute the majority of newly approved cancer therapiesand since 2015, an increasing number of cancer drugs have been recommended for inclusion on the WHO EML. Magnitude of benefit was one of the criteria considered since the 2015 cancer drug listingsand quantified in 2018 in two metrics: (1) a threshold for OS benefit of at least 4–6 months and (2) a score on the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) of A or B in the curative setting and of 4 or 5 in the non-curative setting. These criteria have been recommended for the 2019 and 2021 (21st and 22nd) WHO EMLs. There is debate about the clinical benefit of new cancer drugs which often are approved based on surrogate outcome measures or on pivotal studies that do not permit inference about clinical benefit. Despite WHO proposed two specific criteria for selecting cancer drugs, lack of fidelity may occur because these are guiding principles for selection, among other criteria. However, WHO's goal is to list only drugs with meaningful clinical benefit and these adopted guiding principles are important to achieve this goal. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the documented clinical benefit of targeted cancer drugs in the WHO EML or how approval decisions for the latest WHO EMLs align with WHO's recent magnitude of benefit criteria for selecting cancer drugs. We address these knowledge gaps by assessing documented clinical benefits of WHO-EML cancer drugs. Our specific aims are to (a) assess documented OS benefit for targeted cancer drugs proposed for EML inclusion since 2015 and assess OS benefit magnitude and ESMO-MCBS scores for targeted cancer drugs proposed for listing in the WHO EML since 2019 and (b) assess the consistency of latest listing decisions with WHO criteria for WHO EML cancer drugs.

### Review of phase II trial designs used in studies of molecular targeted agents: outcomes and predictors of success in phase III [^111gDL15]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because the appropriate design and end points for phase II evaluation of targeted anticancer agents are unclear, we undertook a review of recent reports of phase II trials of targeted agents to determine the types of designs used, the planned end points, the outcomes, and the relationship between trial outcomes and regulatory approval.

Methods

We retrieved reports of single-agent phase II trials in six solid tumors for 19 targeted drugs. For each, we abstracted data regarding planned design and actual results. Response rates were examined for any relationship to eventual success of the agents, as determined by US Food and Drug Administration approval for at least one indication.

Results

Eighty-nine trials were identified. Objective response was the primary or coprimary end point in the majority of trials (61 of 89 trials). Fourteen reports were of randomized studies generally evaluating different doses of agents, not as controlled experiments. Enrichment for target expression was uncommon. Objective responses were seen in 38 trials; in 19 trials, response rates were more than 10%, and in eight, they were more than 20%. Agents with high response rates tended to have high nonprogression rates; renal cell carcinoma was the exception to this. Higher overall response rates were predictive of regulatory approval in the tumor types reviewed (P = 0.005).

Conclusion

In practice, phase II design for targeted agents is similar to that for cytotoxics. Objective response seems to be a useful end point for screening new targeted agents because, in our review, its observation predicted for eventual success. Improvements in design are recommended, as is more frequent inclusion of biological questions as part of phase II trials.

### Risks and benefits of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113B3isD]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The two principal goals of any treatment in oncology are to improve patients' quality of life and/or overall survival (OS). While early stage cancer patients might be cured with local treatments, mainly consisting of surgery and/or radiotherapy, patients with advanced cancer who are not eligible for local treatments in a curative intent represent 40 to 50% of all cancer patients and will usually eventually die from their cancer. Anticancer drugs represent the main therapeutic strategy in this latter setting. Cure of patients with advanced solid tumors is extremely rare, but exceptions exist, including patients with metastatic germline tumors who are often cured with multidrug chemotherapy, and a minority of patients who may be cured with immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Molecularly targeted agents given based on the presence of a molecular alteration are usually associated with high response rates, but responses are often limited in time due to the occurrence of resistance mechanisms. In this context, the potential benefits of anticancer treatments have to be weighed against their potential harm when given to patients with advanced cancer.

In oncology, randomized clinical trials represent the gold-standard approach to evaluate the benefits and risks of a new treatment over standard of care. The risks and benefits of anticancer drugs can be precisely evaluated from the subgroup of randomized trials with control arms that do not contain any anticancer drugs. These trials are proposed to patients when they have exhausted standard of care treatment options. However, the randomization versus no active treatment is increasingly challenging in those patients who are often reluctant to possibly receive best supportive care only.

We aimed at quantifying the safety and the efficacy of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients who had exhausted standard of care treatments by performing a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with a control arm consisting of best supportive care with or without a placebo.

### Failure to administer recommended chemotherapy: acceptable variation or cancer care quality blind spot? [^1153iTMd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Background

Chemotherapy quality measures consider hospitals compliant when chemotherapy is recommended, even if it is not received. This may mask shortcomings in cancer care delivery. Objectives of this study were to (1) identify patient factors associated with failure to receive recommended chemotherapy without a documented contraindication and (2) assess hospital variation in failure to administer recommended chemotherapy.

Methods

Patients from 2005 to 2015 with breast, colon and lung cancers who failed to receive recommended chemotherapy were identified using the National Cancer Database. Hospital-level rates of failure to administer recommended chemotherapy were calculated, and patient and hospital factors associated with failure to receive recommended chemotherapy were identified by multivariable logistic regression.

Results

A total of 183 148 patients at 1281 hospitals were analysed. Overall, 3.5% of patients with breast, 6.6% with colon and 10.7% with lung cancers failed to receive recommended chemotherapy. Patients were less likely to receive recommended chemotherapy in all cancers if uninsured or on Medicaid (p < 0.05), as were non-Hispanic black patients with both breast and colon cancer (p < 0.001). Significant hospital variation was observed, with hospital-level rates of failure to administer recommended chemotherapy as high as 21.8% in breast, 40.2% in colon and 40.0% in lung cancers.

Conclusions and Relevance

Though overall rates are low, failure to receive recommended chemotherapy is associated with sociodemographic factors. Hospital variation in failure to administer recommended chemotherapy is masked by current quality measure definitions and may define a significant and unmeasured difference in hospital quality.

### What is the ideal stent as initial intervention for malignant gastric outlet obstruction? [^115LTiTa]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Self-expandable metal stents are effective palliation for malignant gastric outlet obstruction. The aims of study were to evaluate efficacy and safety of double-layered Comvi, uncovered and covered stent to find out protocols which enhance stent patency.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed data from 224 patients who underwent endoscopic stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction caused by stomach cancer from 2006 to 2011. Technical and clinical success rates were evaluated and clinical outcomes were compared according to stent types and chemotherapy.

Results

The overall technical and clinical success rates were achieved in 99.6% and 80.4%, respectively without immediate complications. The clinical success rate was not significantly different between three groups. The median stent patency time was 156 days [interquartile range 66–279] without differences between groups. The 4-, 8-, and 12-week patency rates were 89.4%, 77.3%, and 61.2%, respectively with no differences between groups. The re-stenosis of stent frequently occurred in the case of the uncovered stents, while migration was more likely to be observed for the covered and Comvi stent. Chemotherapy significantly lowered re-intervention rates, especially in uncovered stents.

Conclusions

Patency rates are significantly improved by combining the use of uncovered stent with follow-up chemotherapy treatment, which retains the advantages of the mechanical and chemical aspects of stent and chemotherapy, respectively.

### Design and reporting of interventional clinical trials [^116uUiem]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

What are the different phases in clinical trials? What is the purpose of each of them?

Early phase trials are safety studies, and then late-phase trials are the randomized trials that are generally required before a new treatment is considered for licensing and wider use.

Phase I studies have the primary endpoints of safety and recommended phase II dose — so these trials look to establish the best dose of a drug or combination for further clinical testing. These are also the studies that explore for the first time the clinical pharmacology of a new agent in humans. Phase II studies are traditionally the first efficacy studies and inform the design of the pre-registration phase III study. Therefore, these phase III studies are the pivotal trials that allow a potential new treatment to be considered by the regulators as a standard treatment that would be widely available and recommended. Phase IV studies are carried out post-marketing, often for safety surveillance.

What is the difference between primary and secondary outcomes? Should a clinical trial publication include all the pre-specified outcome measures and at the pre-specified follow-up time? What are the drawbacks of not doing so?

The primary outcome of any study is the key measure to be evaluated by the trial, and the one around which all the sample size and statistical analyses are based. Secondary outcomes follow on from this and are frequently linked. For example, the primary outcome in a cancer trial might be overall survival with a secondary outcome of progression-free survival or time to next treatment being needed. In the early phase safety studies, which are the majority of my clinical practice, primary outcomes are typically the toxicity data reported or recommended phase II dose, with secondary outcomes of drug pharmacokinetics, and response.

### Objective response rate of placebo in randomized controlled trials of anticancer medicines [^116Jx861]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An increasing number of new cancer drugs are approved on the basis of overall response rates (ORR) from single-arm trials. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve a response, which can either be complete response (complete disappearance of lesions) or partial response (reduction in the sum of maximal tumor diameters by at least 30% or more). Between 2017 and 2021, 36% (58/161) of cancer drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were based on ORR from single-arm trials.

However, ORR is a poor marker of drug efficacy as it doesn't correlate with improvement in survival. Despite this poor correlation with survival, one reason for the frequent use of ORR as an endpoint in cancer drug trials is the hypothesis that a malignant tumor would not shrink spontaneously, if not for the drug. However, some studies in the past have shown that solid tumors may also occasionally regress even without treatment, either spontaneously or due to placebo effect. A 2003 meta-analysis showed a response rate of 2% among patients with advanced solid tumors randomized to receive placebo or best supportive care in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This finding was subsequently corroborated in a 2016 study that revealed a similar 2% objective response rates among patients with advanced solid tumors randomized to receive no active treatment in RCTs of cancer drugs.

Such spontaneous regressions or responses are intriguing from both scientific and regulatory standpoints. Therefore, we conducted an updated analysis to discover the ORR, complete response rates (CR), and partial response rates (PR) from placebo in the RCTs conducted in the modern era in which treatment landscapes have changed and 40% Americans believe that cancer can be cured solely through alternative therapies.

### Why does cytotoxic chemotherapy cure only some cancers? [^1132sWa9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Despite frequent responses to chemotherapy, curative treatment remains elusive for the majority of patients with metastatic solid tumors. By contrast, in testicular cancer, gestational choriocarcinoma, Hodgkin disease and high-grade lymphomas, chemotherapy is routinely curative, even for patients who present with widely disseminated disease. In the common advanced cancers, however, over 40 years of cytotoxic drug development has brought no significant change in cure rates. One interpretation is that the intrinsic properties of the malignancies themselves, rather than the qualities of individual drugs or combination therapies, are primarily responsible for their curability with chemotherapy. We suggest that the curability of these malignancies results from an intrinsic 'locked-in' state of sensitivity to proapoptotic stresses in these cells. A common property of such curable malignancies is that they arise from cells that undergo major genetic rearrangements or recombination as part of their normal physiology. The absence of further genetic and epigenetic changes in genes that regulate apoptosis, DNA repair and senescence allows these cells to maintain their intrinsic sensitivity to chemotherapy. This process allows the cells, when challenged with chemotherapy, to undergo the natural apoptotic pathways that contribute to their intrinsic qualities of chemosensitivity and high curability.

### Outcomes and endpoints in trials of cancer treatment: the past, present, and future [^114bRnx3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cancer treatment should allow patients to live better or longer lives, and ideally, both. Trial endpoints should show clinically meaningful improvements in patient survival or quality of life. Alternative endpoints such as progression-free survival, disease-free survival, and objective response rate have been used to identify benefit earlier, but their true validity as surrogate endpoints is controversial. In this Review we discuss the measurement, assessment, and benefits and limitations of trial endpoints in use for cancer treatment. Many stakeholders are affected, including regulatory agencies, industry partners, clinicians, and most importantly, patients. In an accompanying Review, reflections from individual stakeholders are incorporated into a discussion of what the future holds for clinical trial endpoints and design.

### Redefining cancer research for therapeutic breakthroughs [^112n3tCY]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Cancer research is among the most heavily funded areas of science. Thousands of original research articles on cancer are published annually; many of these propose novel mechanisms of tumor growth, migration, metastasis, survival, immune escape etc. Many critics have questioned the validity and necessity of such studies, raising concerns over mass generation of irreproducible, redundant, and unjustified research, both basic and clinical. Remarkably, the three primary pillars of cancer treatment — surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy — which were actively employed at least 60 years ago, continue to serve as the key treatment options today. We have witnessed a dramatic rise in the survival rates of patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these improvements have primarily stemmed from the development of more effective chemotherapy agents and their combinations and the evolution of radiotherapy approaches, owing to significant advancements in technology. Earlier diagnosis, improved stratification and better management of treatments have further contributed to improved survival. Certainly, novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies have provided great benefits for cancer patients in recent decades. Unfortunately, these treatments are burdened with multiple pitfalls, including: (i) their applicability being restricted to a specific molecular subset of cancer patients, (ii) exorbitant costs, (iii) limited availability, and (iv) tumors' developing resistance to therapy. Indeed, only ~40% of cancer patients in the United States were eligible to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors in 2018, and only 12.46% of these patients responded to therapy. The cost of these therapies presents another critical issue. For example, the total treatment expense for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has been estimated to reach up to $500,000 for patients experiencing severe cytokine release syndrome, which is a common adverse reaction to this type of treatment. Furthermore, the availability of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in low- and middle-income countries is minimal; thus, 85% of the world's population still relies on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for cancer treatment. Additionally, while most targeted therapies and immunotherapies extend a patient's survival, they are rarely, if ever, 100% curative without surgery and/or intensive chemo-/radiotherapy regimens. Resistance to targeted therapy is frequently inevitable and leads to tumor recurrence in most patients. For example, BRAF-targeting drugs radically changed the clinical practice in melanoma treatment, extending median survival from 6 to 30 months. However, most patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma experience a relapse in the first year after targeted therapy discontinuation, of which 50% occur in the first 3 months. Clearly, innovative approaches for cancer treatment are urgently needed. Thus, it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the stumbling progress of innovative cancer research and speculate on how we should approach cancer research in the next decades, given the constraints of climate change, limited economic growth and geopolitical turbulence.

### Tumor response and survival end points in clinical trials: a clinician's perspective [^1141t2KU]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Survival has become the gold standard for determining the relative effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens in phase III clinical trials and is measured generally as the median survival. Response could be a surrogate for survival in evaluating clinical trials for chemotherapy, but it has become a controversial measurement parameter because of the quantitative variability in measurement and the fact that differences in response rates are not commonly translated into differences in survival. However, if response is indeed a determinant of survival, the median survival (the point at which 50% of the patients are alive) will not be impacted because response rates (RR) for most advanced cancers are less than 50%. Nonetheless, a survival benefit has been identified for tumors in which response rates are 50% or less in 4 phase III randomized trials; 2 in breast cancer (a high response-rate tumor) also show significant differences in survival. These data would imply that factors other than tumor response could be operative in influencing survival. It is a categorical truth that "responders" live longer than "nonresponders", but the response and survival relationship is complex and both parameters are important in clinical trials.

### Optimal timing of cancer treatments: a call for emerging evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies [^113JdPGL]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Early detection and timely treatment are essential to ensure optimal survival and avoid long-term morbidities associated with complex therapies for advanced cancers. However, delayed diagnosis and long wait times for treatment remain significant healthcare problems globally, risking the progression of disease to more advanced stages and potentially shifting the treatment intent from curative to palliative.

Cancer treatment has entered the era of personalised or precision medicine. Cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment can be targeted by advanced therapies like targeted therapies and immunotherapies based on the expression of biomarkers, providing superior treatment efficacy and manageable toxicity profiles to systemic standard-of-care therapies. Such features drive progressive development of existing treatment options: combining non-surgical treatment options, extending indications to earlier-stage, resectable cancers in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings, and further refining treatment lines with more precise options. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to evolve, improving the above strategies for better outcomes.

### Endpoints for assessing drug activity in clinical trials [^111f3JDj]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Overall survival remains the gold standard for the demonstration of clinical benefit. An improvement in overall survival is a direct clinical benefit to patients. An analysis of overall survival requires larger patient numbers and longer follow-up than other endpoints. Survival analysis may be confounded by subsequent therapies. Time to progression usually requires smaller clinical trials and may be more rapidly assessed than trials using overall survival as an endpoint. This endpoint is not confounded by subsequent therapies. Time to progression must use the same evaluation techniques and schedules for all therapies being evaluated. Blinding of trials or the use of an external blinded radiographic review committee is recommended in assessing time to progression. Unlike overall survival and time to progression, which must be evaluated in randomized trials, response rates can be accurately assessed using a single-arm trial. Stable disease is not included in a response rate determination and is optimally evaluated by assessing tumor progression in a randomized trial. Improvement in disease-related symptoms is considered clinical benefit and may be an appropriate endpoint for drug approval.

### Global cancer drug development – A report from the 2022 accelerating anticancer agent development and validation meeting [^113wRCvx]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer remains one of the greatest health threats globally. In 2020, there were an estimated 19.3 million new diagnoses of cancer and 10 million deaths. More than 50% of incident cases occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where patients face disproportionately high incidence to mortality ratios. By 2040, it is estimated that the number of patients with an indication for first-course systemic treatment for cancer will rise to at least 15 million, and the majority (at least 68%) of these patients will reside in LMICs. And yet, access to systemic treatment in LMICs is limited and mirrored by deficits in surgery, radiotherapy, and diagnostics services. LMICs have a < 5% share of the global resource for combating cancer, and many patients do not receive guideline concordant care.

Over the past 2 decades, global investment in cancer research has been unprecedented, and the pace of new drug development has been unrelenting. Between 2017 and 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued 161 new approvals for cancer therapeutics across a range of solid tumor malignancies and indications. Compared with 13 years before this period (2002–2014), the FDA approved only 71 treatments for solid cancers in adults. This rapidly expanding armamentarium of cancer therapeutics has resulted in a huge expansion in treatment and regulatory complexity. The high cost of many new drugs has created major challenges in the affordability of cancer treatment for patients and health care systems. These complexities and cost issues extend beyond adult solid cancers into pediatricand hematology/oncology domains. New systemic treatments combined with improved screening, diagnostic, surgical, and radiotherapy techniques for many cancers have resulted in significantly improved survival outcomes over time. However, these overall survival gains have largely been restricted to high-income countries (HICs), highlighting gross inequities in cancer care globally. Moreover, although certain new therapeutics have resulted in clearly meaningful gains (such as immunotherapy for melanoma and lung cancer), only 31% of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) supporting market approval in cancer between 2010 and 2015 met the European Society for Clinical Oncology's thresholds for meaningful clinical benefits using the magnitude of clinical benefit scale. Other studies have reported that the median improvement in overall survival associated with new cancer medicines is between 2 and 4 months. The rapidly changing treatment landscape, combined with the marginal clinical gains and high costs for many therapies, creates an immensely challenging environment for national governments, policy makers, regulatory bodies, private payers, patients, and clinicians worldwide.

### Making adjuvant therapy decisions with uncertain data [^113FNgQF]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of adjuvant therapy — therapy given after the curative intent treatment of the primary cancer and in the absence of any measurable disease — is to reduce the risk of local and distant recurrence in order to reduce the complications of local failure (improve quality of life) and/or improve survival. This logic underlies the rational use for local therapies such as radiation, and systemic therapies such as chemo-, targeted- and immune-therapies. Recent trials in oncology highlight three issues in adjuvant therapy. First, is it good enough to improve disease-free survival (DFS) if that does not translate into overall survival (OS)? Second, what magnitude of DFS should we pursue? And, third, how should we use adjuvant drugs in settings without randomized controlled trials (RCTs)?

Although the use of adjuvant therapies is common in a variety of malignancies — most notably in lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer — the evidence that their use improves overall survival is not always clear. Improving DFS from removal of primary tumor to development of relapse or death is sometimes considered to be a surrogate for overall survival; however, the correlations are not always strong. For instance, the DFS in the adjuvant setting provides good correlation for OS in colon and lung cancers, but not breast. In the absence of strong correlation, improving DFS without improving OS may offer a poor risk/benefit tradeoff to the patient, because unlike the metastatic setting, adjuvant therapy, by definition, cannot make people feel better. It is important to ask in settings with weak correlations whether other composite end points may be more robust. For instance, DFS in breast cancer includes local recurrence or ductal carcinoma in situ, and one wonders whether a composite of more severe events (distant metastasis or death) might function as a superior surrogate. Future research should test such claims.

### Retrospective evaluation of penguin cold caps for chemotherapy-induced alopecia [^116N7NQz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of Penguin Caps has an overall 20–90% success rate, defined as hair loss < 50%, across several trials evaluating success in breast cancer and 79% success in a limited evaluation in cancer types. The range of success rate is due, in part to measures of success (patient-reported vs. objective measures) and regimens used, with better success in non-anthracycline-based, shorter regimens. It is also unclear from literature how much effectiveness varies based on patient characteristics such as hair type.

As such, the purpose of this retrospective, descriptive study was to evaluate data that are routinely recorded during the cold capping process to determine tolerability and subjective effectiveness of cold capping in minimizing CIA. We further sought to determine whether CIA varies according to chemotherapy regimens or patient/hair characteristics prior to starting chemotherapy/capping, including race, ethnicity, and hair thickness, coarseness, length, and type (e.g. straight vs. curly).

### Factors driving pancreatic cancer survival rates [^1159QgS1]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

The most effective PDAC treatments integrate surgical resection and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, only 12% of PDAC patients are eligible for this regimen due to the advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, and only 10% are candidates for potentially curative surgery. – Currently, up to 80% of PDAC patients receive their diagnoses after the disease has advanced to a stage where treatment is often limited to palliative care, contributing to a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Staging at time of diagnosis plays a major role in predicting survival rates, making this variable essential for understanding where improvements are needed. For patients with localized disease, the cancer is confined to the pancreas and can often be surgically removed. In these situations, the 5-year survival rate is 44%–46%. For individuals diagnosed with regional disease, where cancer has spread to nearby structures or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 16%. Finally, the 5-year survival rate drops to 3% for patients with distant disease, when the cancer has metastasized to distant organs. This trend confirms that early diagnosis is key to increasing treatment options and improving overall prognosis.

The overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer has increased from 6% to 12% over the last decade. This improvement is often conflated with better treatment options and improved outcomes across all stages of the disease. However, this change may more accurately reflect enhanced survival at specific disease stages. To better understand these changes and ensure that pancreatic cancer outcomes are improving for all patients, it is important to closely evaluate disease epidemiology data, with consideration of staging at time of diagnosis and adjoining survival rates. In this study, we utilize SEER data to investigate survival rates across various stages of the disease and provide an in-depth analysis to look at the underlying drivers that contribute to the observed change in the overall survival rate.

### Proportion of patients in phase 2 oncology trials receiving treatments that are ultimately approved [^115FD1bR]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical development of new drugs typically follows 3 stages. In phase 1 trials, drugs are tested for safety and dosing. Phase 2 clinical trials or dose expansion cohorts in phase 1 are then used to evaluate whether a new drug shows signs of efficacy — typically using a surrogate endpoint. Drugs showing promise in phase 2 are then tested in phase 3 trials, which often inform regulatory approvals.

Numerous studies have sought to address the risk/benefit balance for phase 1 cancer trials. These studies show an approximate objective response rate ranging from 3.8% to 13.2%, with a rate of life-threatening toxicity ranging from 10% to 19%. Several commentators have used these findings, as well as principled arguments, to suggest that the ethical justification for risk associated with giving new drugs to patients in phase 1 trials rests on their scientific value, not their prospect of therapeutic benefit. This position has implications for trial design, ethical review, consent, and reporting.

In contrast, little is known about risk/benefit for trials of new drugs after initial phase 1 testing (ie, phase 1 dose expansion cohorts or classic phase 2 trials — hereafter called "phase 2" for short). Such phase 2 trials typically enroll patients who, like those in phase 1 trials, have advanced cancer and have exhausted standard care. However, unlike initial phase 1 trials, all patients receive drugs at doses that are expected to have biological activity and are more likely to have side effects. The high failure rate of drugs entering phase 2 trials (7%–11% advance to FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval in cancer, 16%–21% in all therapeutic areas) provides grounds for thinking that patients in phase 2 trials are unlikely to receive a drug that will prove to have a risk/benefit balance that could be considered therapeutic. Previous work has assessed the risk/benefit balance of phase 2 clinical trials by meta-analyzing the response rate and rate of adverse events in pediatric phase 2 clinical trials. However, such methods depend on surrogate measures of benefit that are weakly correlated with survival.

### Can patients with relapsed, previously untreated, stage I epithelial ovarian cancer be successfully treated with salvage therapy? [^117XygUW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has been controversial. We have previously reported the cases of patients managed with a policy of observation only. We now present the salvage rate for the patients in that study who experienced relapse.

Patients and Methods

One hundred ninety-four patients with stage I EOC presenting between 1980 and 1994 received no adjuvant chemotherapy, but were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy at relapse. We calculated the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort and the salvage rate for those who experienced relapse. We defined salvage as freedom from relapse for 5 years after platinum treatment.

Results

Sixty-one (31%) of 194 patients experienced relapse, and 55 received platinum-based chemotherapy. Twenty-four percent were progression-free at 5 years after this treatment. Clear-cell histology and cyst rupture before the patients' original surgery were independent prognostic factors for PFS after salvage chemotherapy. The OS for all 194 patients is 72% at 10 years (median follow-up, 8.7 years), with an 80% disease-specific survival (DSS).

Conclusion

We have shown that some patients with stage I EOC can be successfully treated with a salvage chemotherapy regimen after a policy of observation only. Interestingly, approximately 30% of stage I patients who die within 10 years do so from causes other than EOC (OS, 72%; DSS, 80%). Our findings need to be taken into consideration when the results from recent randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy in this patient population (International Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm Trial 1/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Ovarian Neoplasm Trial) are being discussed with patients.

### Risks and benefits of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JPtge]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The overall HR for PFS was 0.58 [95%CI (confidence interval): 0.53–0.63] (Fig. 2 A–C). Average median PFS in the experimental arms was 5.7 months, as compared to 3.6 months in the control arms. The HR improved over time, from 0.87 [95%CI: 0.62–1.23] during the 2000–2005 period to 0.69 [95%CI: 0.61–0.79] during the 2005–2010 period, 0.54 [95%CI: 0.48–0.62] during the 2010–2015 period, and 0.52 [95%CI: 0.46–0.59] during the 2015–2020 period (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 A). The HR did not differ significantly between trials using a placebo versus trials with BSC only (P = 0.58) (Fig. 2 B). Some statistically significant heterogeneity was observed between treatment classes, with HRs that were less favorable with immunotherapy and hormone therapy (0.75 [95%CI: 0.63–0.88]), as compared to chemotherapy (0.53 [95%CI: 0.43–0.65]) and molecularly targeted agents (0.54 [95%CI: 0.49–0.60]) (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 C).

### Population, clinical, and scientific impact of national cancer institute's national clinical trials network treatment studies [^111kzjYV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics

Overall, 544 trials were assessed to have been conducted during the study period, and 189 trials were considered for inclusion in the analysis on the basis of determination by the study team (Data Supplement). Twenty-seven trials were excluded for the following reasons: not a treatment trial (6), positive result but too toxic to recommend (6), not a positive trial (4), positive trial but not for a time-to-event end point (ie, tumor response only; 8), and other reasons (3; Data Supplement). Therefore, 162 trials published from 1981 to 2018 comprised of 108,334 patients were analyzed, representing nearly one third (162/544, 29.8%) of trials conducted by the groups (Data Supplement). A wide variety of cancers were studied, with the most common tumors involving breast (34, 21.0%), gynecologic organs (28, 17.3%), and lungs (14, 8.6%; Table 1). Nearly all trials (155, 95.7%) had superiority designs, and most (130, 80.2%) included chemotherapy. The majority (113, 69.8%) were conducted between 1990 and 2009.

Trial Characteristics

Population Impact

Overall, 82.1% (133/161) of trials showed overall survival favoring the experimental arm to some extent, including 92 instances (56.8%) where overall survival for the experimental arm was statistically significantly superior. Through 2020, these trials were estimated to have contributed to 14.2 million (95% CI, 11.5 to 16.5 million) additional life-years (Fig 1). For the same trials, the projected estimates for 2025 and 2030 were 19.0 million (95% CI, 16.1 to 22.3 million) and 24.1 million (95% CI, 19.7 to 28.2 million) life-years gained, respectively (Fig 2).

### Ovarian cancer: strategies for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy [^113KBspC]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2003). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer is responsible for 4% of deaths from cancer in women. Treatment comprises a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, but patients typically experience disease relapse within 2 years of the initial treatment. Further treatment can extend survival, although relapse eventually occurs again. A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie this drug resistance should allow treatment to be optimized, so that substantial improvements in the outlook for women with this disease can be achieved.

### Chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [^114v9gAQ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2003). Low credibility.

Achieving substantial and meaningful improvements in the response and survival rates for advanced pancreatic cancer has proved to be an elusive goal for many years. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy has typically produced discouraging response rates or improved clinical benefit for patients, and attempts to improve these results by altering 5-FU dosages, administration schedules, or using a variety of drugs in combination with 5-FU have been unrewarding. A clinical benefit, however, was identified when gemcitabine first generated improvements in symptom control in patients with advanced disease. In a subsequent randomized trial, gemcitabine demonstrated superiority to 5-FU with respect to response rate, time to progression, and median survival. These improvements were also associated with improvement in clinical benefit. The findings of subsequent randomized Phase III trials have suggested a survival benefit for gemcitabine compared with several single agents or combinations. Gemcitabine has thus become the de facto standard of care for advanced pancreatic cancer, and current efforts are directed toward finding strategies that can capitalize on and extend these clinical benefits.

### Improving lung cancer survival; time to move on… [^116grWf4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Approximately 85% of all cases of lung cancer are non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 5-year survival of this aggressive disease is only 16%. One of the reasons for this extremely poor survival is that most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the relative lack of clinical symptoms during early stages. Metastatic NSCLC is currently an incurable disease for which standard chemotherapy provides only minor improvement in overall survival. In addition, less than 30% of patients with advanced-stage NSCLC have a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, the most commonly used first line treatment at this stage of the disease.

During the last decades, advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of this devastating disease have been made, however, long-term survival rates have hardly changed in the past 50 years. Therefore, new approaches are required.

### Combination therapies for cancer: challenges and opportunities [^114QMUvb]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal cancers account for around 25.8% of newly diagnosed cancers annually. Among them, pancreatic cancer is the most lethal cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of only around 12%. There are more than 495,700 new cases of pancreatic cancer each year. Unfortunately, over 80% of these patients lost the opportunity of surgery at diagnosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy helps some patients regain the opportunity of radical resection, the only way for possible cure. Numerous efforts have been made in hopes of increasing the efficacy while decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy. A widely-used chemotherapy agent is gemcitabine, which is usually combined with other drugs as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment option. The first-line chemotherapy regimen is FOLFIRINOX consisting of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. Although this regimen achieved a relatively satisfying anti-tumor effect on metastatic pancreatic cancer, it would inevitably bring undesirable adverse effects, which reduced treatment efficacy. Optimizing the dose of the FOLFIRINOX regimen is critical for the treatment efficacy.

### Therapeutic outcome of early-phase clinical trials in multiple myeloma: a meta-analysis [^112rDrkt]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early-phase clinical trials in oncology are used to determine the safety profile, dosing regimen, and preliminary efficacy of an experimental drug. Phase I trials often represent the first-in-human use and are primarily used to assess toxicities, dosing schedule, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Historically, there was no or only very limited therapeutic intent in phase I trials. Phase II trials test the selected dosing regimen in a larger sample to acquire insight into the effectiveness of experimental drugs. In oncology, participants in early-phase clinical trials typically have the advanced-stage disease and have exhausted one or more lines of approved therapeutic regimens. Participants are to expect a higher risk of toxicities, while the activity of the experimental drug is uncertain.

In the 1970s and 1980s, overall response rates (ORR) in phase I trials in oncology were estimated to be < 5% –. However, rates of therapeutic success have improved since, with estimated responses of 5–10% in the 1990s and estimates for the past two decades varying from 5 to 20% –. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, among others, perceives phase I trials as having therapeutic intent and sees participation as a therapeutic option. However, it remains subject to debate whether phase I trials genuinely offer therapeutic benefit in relation to their risks.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignancy primarily located in the bone marrow and is the second most common hematologic malignancy. There have been many drug approvals for MM in the last 15 years, which have significantly prolonged survival for patients. Despite significant improvements in treatment possibilities and survival, MM remains an incurable malignancy and is characterized by high rates of relapse and therapy resistance. In the course of disease progression, participation in an early-phase clinical trial can be considered. However, a recent systematic review to inform clinicians and patients on the risks and benefits of these trials is lacking. Therefore, we examined the rates of response and toxicities in early-phase clinical trials in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) and assessed differences across years of publication and drug classes.

### Trends in the risks and benefits to patients with cancer participating in phase 1 clinical trials [^115RrfXo]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

In the past, cancer patients entering phase 1 studies confronted the prospects of high risk and unlikely benefit. Over the last decade, cancer drugs under development have become more targeted, and the clinical research environment has become more scrutinized. The impact of these changes on the risks and benefits to patients who participate in phase 1 cancer trials is unknown.

Objective

To determine trends in the rates of treatment-related (toxic) death, objective response, and serious toxicity and to identify factors associated with these outcomes.

Data Sources

We searched abstracts and journal articles reporting the results of phase 1 cancer treatment trials originally submitted to annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) from 1991 through 2002.

Study Selection

We focused on published single-agent trials that enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors and excluded studies testing agents already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of the ASCO presentation.

Data Extraction

Multiple observers independently extracted information on trial design, location, sponsorship, types of tumors treated, drug class, route of administration, and clinical outcomes.

Data Synthesis

The overall toxic death rate for 213 studies (involving 6474 cancer patients) published in peer-reviewed journals was 0.54%, while the overall objective response rate was 3.8%. Toxic death rates decreased over the study period, from 1.1% over the first 4 years of the study (1991–1994) to 0.06% over the most recent 4-year period (1999–2002) (P < .01). Response rates also decreased but by proportionally much less. After adjusting for characteristics of the experimental trials and the investigational agents, the odds of a patient dying from an experimental treatment while participating in a trial submitted during the most recent 4-year period were less than one tenth those of a patient participating in a trial submitted during the first 4-year period (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.67; p = 0.009). In comparison, the adjusted odds of a patient experiencing an objective response over the same time periods decreased by approximately half (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.66; P < .001).

Conclusions

The level of risk experienced by cancer patients who participate in phase 1 treatment trials appears to have improved over the 12-year period from 1991 through 2002. Because toxic death rates have decreased more quickly than have objective response rates, the ratio of risk to benefit may have also improved. These changes relate in part to the targeted and less-toxic nature of newer cancer drugs and are coincident with the increased attention that has been paid to the safety of clinical research over the time period we analyzed.

### Successes and failures of combined modality therapies in head and neck cancer [^113bpoQ6]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The paradigms for treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are changing as new subgroups are defined. The technical successes of improved radiation therapy are many; however, the success of novel combined therapies are few. With the emergence of human papillomavirus and the development of immunooncology agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are we ready to reevaluate how we use radiation and chemotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic disease-will we remain the fire or become the fire starter?

### Optimal treatment for relapsing ovarian cancer [^116Mvne7]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The cure rate for women with ovarian cancer has not significantly changed over the past 10 years. However, overall survival from relapsed disease has shown improvement despite a lack of increase in progression-free survival. There are now many therapeutic options for women with relapsed disease. Treatment strategies are still led by the description of relapse as platinum sensitive or resistant/refractory using somewhat arbitrary definitions. Now that there is increased choice of treatment, these definitions are becoming outdated. The current challenges in managing relapsed ovarian cancer are defining the optimal sequence of available drugs as well as timing of treatment for relapsed disease. The abundance of novel therapeutics and molecular targets has compounded the difficulty in identifying best practice but has undoubtedly provided an opportunity to improve the treatment we can offer our patients. The lack of validated biomarkers to inform patient selection remains an area of real need in ovarian cancer. Efforts should be made to increase the use of biomarkers in trial design to aid rational targeting of new therapies. In this review we discuss current practice in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer and highlight the most promising emerging therapeutics and strategies being employed in randomized clinical trials.

### Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [^113wk3wg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti-cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision-making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life-threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Search Methods

We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta-analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti-cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine-based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine-based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias. Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated. Eight studies compared non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5-fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events. Twenty-eight studies compared gemcitabine-based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL. Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine-based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events. Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine-based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine-based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups. We included only one radiotherapy (iodine-125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low-quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.

### Determining lines of therapy in patients with solid cancers: a proposed new systematic and comprehensive framework [^114CLgrv]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Which treatments should be assigned a line of therapy?

Great heterogeneity exists in the literature and clinical trial protocols regarding what constitutes a LoT. Some clinical trial eligibility criteria allow prior systemic therapies for locally advanced inoperable cancer to be counted as a LoT, while others count SACT for distant metastases only; some criteria require completion of all curative systemic therapy, while others just require a certain number of prior SACTs irrespective of clinical setting or intent.

Anti-cancer treatments are often tailored to the extent of disease, an approach termed 'goal-concordant care'. For example, in patients with breast cancer, the therapeutic approach to early disease is distinct from that of metastatic disease, while therapy of patients with inoperable locally advanced disease is often similar to that of patients with disseminated malignancy. At present, many clinicians and clinical trial protocols assign LoT only to SACT for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic disease and/or when the treatment intent is palliative. There are two key arguments against this restrictive approach. First, the boundary between early and advanced disease settings, and that between curative and palliative intent, can be blurred. It is well-established that cancer is a systemic disease, with a spectrum of increasing cancer burden from small lesions in the primary organ to locally advanced carcinoma to oligometastatic disease to widespread visceral metastases (Fig. 1); the corresponding goals of anti-cancer therapy range from cure through achieving durable remission to symptomatic relief at different time points in a patient's journey. Matching treatment intent to the extent of disease might be straightforward in some scenarios, such as curative intent in the early disease setting, but not in others. For example, the development of multiple lung metastases would make the intent of subsequent SACT palliative in a patient with breast cancer since advanced breast cancer is believed to be incurable; however, if the same clinical scenario of multiple lung metastases was seen in a patient with seminoma, the intent may still be curative, given the excellent chemosensitivity of this type of cancer. If a patient with a limited number of liver metastases receives preoperative chemotherapy followed by complete resection, some clinicians and trial protocols would not count this as a 'line' of SACT in the case of a colonic primary; by contrast, chemotherapy for treating liver metastases would count as a LoT for a patient with breast cancer. Hence, restricting LoT only to the advanced setting and/or when used with palliative intent could lead to inconsistencies among different solid cancers with regards to what should be counted as a 'line'. Even within the same tumour type, such as breast cancer, therapy for locally advanced disease is counted as a LoT in some studies, but not in others. Second, there is evidence that the clinically meaningful benefit (such as objective response rate and progression-free survival) of subsequent SACTs decreases as the number of lines of prior SACT increases. – It is reasonable to hypothesise that this inverse linear association should also apply to the total number of such SACTs administered, not just those given in the advanced/palliative setting. For example, patients with early breast cancer who have residual disease at surgery following neoadjuvant treatment, or who develop isolated locoregional recurrence, often receive additional systemic therapy that might well have an impact on subsequent therapeutic options and clinical outcomes, but such treatment is not currently counted as a LoT by many clinicians and trial protocols.

### Maintaining success, reducing treatment burden, focusing on survivorship: highlights from the third European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ-cell cancer [^114tpwZn]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

reproductive health, late toxic effects and HRQoL

Testicular cancer patients are at risk to experience fertility distress and difficulty in fathering children. Fertility problems often precede GCC diagnosis and infertility is an accepted risk factor for GCC development. The fatherhood rate among testicular cancer survivors wishing to father a child is ∼70% within 15 years having a strong correlation with treatment intensity. Compared with the general population, the 10-year post-treatment paternity rate remains significantly reduced. No increased risk of malformations is found in children of GCC survivors. Patients should be counseled about these figures and pre-chemotherapy semen cryopreservation offered.

Male hypogonadism after treatment as defined by total testosterone serum levels < 8 nmol/l is frequent and varies between 11% and 35% among GCC survivors. Therefore, the determination of testosterone is recommended during follow-up and replacement offered to all patients with low testosterone levels and/or symptoms of hypogonadism to prevent long-term sequelae.

There is about a two- to threefold increased risk of late cardiovascular toxicity (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and stroke) among GCC survivors treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy compared with the general population, which is more prominent in GCC patients treated at a younger age or treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Overall, the cumulative risk of such events over 20 years may be as high as 18%. Death mainly from coronary heart disease accounts for a higher overall non-cancer mortality among long-term GCC survivors. The exact reasons for late cardiovascular toxicity are unknown, but may be related to a direct endovascular damage and accelerated atherosclerosis or vascular ageing induced by cisplatin. The onset of a Raynaud phenomenon might possibly represent a clinical biomarker to identify survivors with augmented atherosclerosis, who could benefit from prophylactic interventions.

### Early mortality after chemotherapy as a quality indicator-the leukemia perspective [^115rjegg]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

How about therapy given within 2 weeks of death in a terminally ill cancer patient? Here, the distinction between solid tumors and leukemia, and recently other hematologic cancers such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma, is important. In solid cancers, the tumor is already advanced and/or metastatic, the poor prognosis well-defined, and poor quality of life irreversible (cancer-associated pain requiring narcotics; no effective salvage chemotherapy; median survival of less than 3–12 months). Thus, the administration of chemotherapy in the last 2–4 weeks of life may not be of value. Leukemia is a different situation, where, for example, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second salvage and beyond may still be rescued with effective combinations of chemotherapy and novel targeted or immune therapies, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation or CAR T-cells. The potential long-term survival ranges from 20 to 60% depending on the prior therapies and remission duration. However, such therapies are associated with mortality rates of 5–20+% from complications of myelosuppression (infections, bleeding) or other treatment-related toxicities (e.g. cytokine release syndrome). Hence "receipt of chemotherapy in the last two (or four) weeks of life" is associated with anticipated risks, rather than being a poor-quality indicator. In essence, a good benefit:risk approach. The same applies to salvage patients with lymphoma and myeloma, where today, novel immune strategies such as CAR T-cells and BiTEs are producing unprecedented response rates, durable remissions and potential long-term survival rates of 20% to 50+%.

### The realisation of targeted antitumour therapy [^117D4FQP]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Front-line therapy for cancer not accessible to surgical intervention has for the last 30 years remained a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy. Despite recent advances in patient survival resulting from the development of newer generation cytotoxic agents such as the taxanes and gemcitabine, the overall prognosis for patients with most common cancers remains poor. Failure to improve conventional cytotoxic therapy over a period of several decades has led cancer researchers to search for completely novel approaches to treat cancer.

The present time is an exciting one for those involved in cancer research and treatment, as several of the strategies embarked upon a decade ago to enable targeting of tumour therapy are now achieving fruition. Such approaches have evolved from a greater understanding of the pathways regulating cell proliferation and metastasis. These studies have identified novel cancer targets and enabled the subsequent development of targeted therapeutics. The number of new agents approved for use in the clinic is growing, as are the number of anticancer clinical trials. Of more significance is that the vast majority of the anticancer clinical trials now in progress involve novel drugs such as angiogenesis inhibitors (nearly one half) rather than chemically modified conventional cytotoxic agents. It is hoped that these novel agents will become valuable therapeutic tools used in combination with certain conventional cytotoxic agents within a multimodal approach to the treatment of cancer. It is anticipated that such treatments will lead to significant improvements in cancer therapy.

### Risks and benefits of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ijtKF]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of anticancer drugs without active comparators in patients who have exhausted standard of care treatment options are debated. We aimed to quantify the safety and the efficacy of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients who have exhausted standard of care treatments from RCTs without active comparators.

Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to preferred reporting Items for systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (CRD42021243968). A systematic literature search of English language publications from January 1, 2000, to January 7, 2021, was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed). Eligible trials included all RCTs evaluating anticancer drugs in adult patients with advanced solid tumors with a control arm without any anticancer drug consisting of best supportive care with or without a placebo. RCTs performed in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant or maintenance settings were excluded, as were clinical trials evaluating anticancer drugs in combination with radiotherapy. Two authors (C.M.B. and E.C.) independently reviewed the studies for inclusion. Data from published reports were extracted by investigators, and random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the overall hazard ratios (HRs) of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Correlations between severe toxicity and efficacy was assessed using R 2 measures.

Findings: Of 3551 studies screened, 128 eligible trials were found involving 47,432 patients. The HRs for PFS and OS were 0.58 [95%CI: 0.53–0.63] and 0.82 [95%CI: 0.78–0.85]. The absolute benefits however were limited with PFS and OS gains of 2.1 and 0.5 months. The absolute excesses in all grade, severe grade III, IV and V (death) adverse events between the two arms were +13.9%, 10.2%, and +0.5%. A weak correlation was measured between the excess of severe toxicity and efficacy (all R² < 0.2).

Interpretation: Anticancer drugs evaluated in RCTs against no active treatment benefited trial participants. Severe toxicity did not significantly correlate with efficacy.

### The future of clinical trial design in oncology [^116wPxR8]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials represent a fulcrum for oncology drug discovery and development to bring safe and effective medicines to patients in a timely manner. Clinical trials have shifted from traditional studies evaluating cytotoxic chemotherapy in largely histology-based populations to become adaptively designed and biomarker-driven evaluations of molecularly targeted agents and immune therapies in selected patient subsets. This review will discuss the scientific, methodological, practical, and patient-focused considerations to transform clinical trials. A call to action is proposed to establish the framework for next-generation clinical trials that strikes an optimal balance of operational efficiency, scientific impact, and value to patients. SIGNIFICANCE: The future of cancer clinical trials requires a framework that can efficiently transform scientific discoveries to clinical utility through applications of innovative technologies and dynamic design methodologies. Next-generation clinical trials will offer individualized strategies which ultimately contribute to globalized knowledge and collective learning, through the joint efforts of all key stakeholders including investigators and patients.

### Cisplatin versus carboplatin in combination with third-generation drugs for advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^116uzUrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in both sexes worldwide. Approximately 50% of those diagnosed with lung cancer will have locally advanced or metastatic disease and will be treated in a palliative setting. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has benefits in terms of survival and symptom control when compared with best supportive care.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of carboplatin-based chemotherapy when compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, both in combination with a third-generation drug, in people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To compare quality of life in people with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and carboplatin combined with a third-generation drug.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 13 January 2019), MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to 13 January 2019), and Embase (via Ovid) (1974 to 13 January 2019). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meetings (January 1990 to September 2018) and reference lists from relevant resources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin combined with a third-generation drug in people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We accepted any regimen and number of cycles that included these drugs, since there is no widely accepted standard regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. The primary outcomes were overall survival and health-related quality of life. The secondary outcomes were one-year survival rate, objective response rate and toxicity.

Main Results

In this updated review, we located one additional RCT, for a total of 11 included RCTs (5088 participants, 4046 of whom were available for meta-analysis). There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.20; 10 RCTs; 2515 participants; high-quality evidence); one-year survival rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; I² = 17%; 4004 participants; all 11 RCTs; high-quality evidence); or response rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; I² = 12%; all 11 RCTs; 4020 participants; high-quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing carboplatin with different doses of cisplatin found an overall survival benefit in favour of carboplatin-based regimens when compared to cisplatin at lower doses (40 to 80 mg/m²) (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28; 6 RCTs; 2508 participants), although there was no overall survival benefit when carboplatin-based chemotherapy was compared to cisplatin at higher doses (80 to 100 mg/m²) (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs; 1823 participants). Carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.04; I² = 68%; 10 RCTs; 3670 participants) and was associated with more neurotoxicity (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; I² = 0%, 5 RCTs; 1489 participants), although we believe this last finding is probably related to a confounding factor (higher dose of paclitaxel in the carboplatin-containing treatment arm of a large study included in the analysis). There was no statistically significant difference in renal toxicity (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45; I² = 3%; 3 RCTs; 1272 participants); alopecia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs; 300 participants); anaemia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.38; I² = 77%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants); and neutropenia (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.63; I² = 94%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants) between cisplatin-based chemotherapy and carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Two RCTs performed a health-related quality of life analysis; however, as they used different methods of measurement we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. One RCT reported comparative health-related quality of life data between cisplatin and carboplatin-containing arms but found no significant differences in global indices of quality of life, including global health status or functional scales. In this Cochrane review, we found that the quality of evidence was high for overall survival, one-year survival rate and response rate but moderate quality evidence for the other outcomes measured.

Authors' Conclusions

Advanced NSCL patients treated with carboplatin or cisplatin doublet with third-generation chemotherapy drugs showed equivalent overall survival, one-year survival, and response rate. Regarding adverse events, carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia, and cisplatin caused more nausea/vomiting. Therefore, in this palliative therapeutic intent, the choice of the platin compound should take into account the expected toxicity profile, patient's comorbidities and preferences.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^113kcRBq]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab for early-stage/locally advanced breast cancer — trial results and approval are outlined: At the time of guideline writing, pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. In I SPY 2, 'Graduation' for efficacy occurs if the predefined efficacy threshold of 85% probability of success in a subtype-specific, hypothetical 300 patient phase III trial is met. For the 69 patients receiving pembrolizumab, the final estimated pCR rates in the TNBC cohort were 60% versus 22% for pembrolizumab versus control; the estimated pCR rates were 30% versus 13% in the HR+/HER2− cohort and 44% versus 17% among all HER2− patients. In another I SPY 2 arm, the estimated pCR rates for the HR+/HER2− and TNBC signatures were 15% (95% CI 10% to 29%) versus 13% (95% CI 9% to 20%) and 27% (95% CI 9% to 45%) versus 22% (95% CI 19% to 50%), respectively. In KEYNOTE-173, the overall pCR rate for all cohorts was 60% (90% CI 30% to 85%), with ORR ranging from 70% to 100%, and at a median follow-up of 19.6 months the 12-month EFS rate was 100% and 88% for patients who did and did not achieve pCR, respectively.

### Neoadjuvant trials in early breast cancer: pathological response at surgery and correlation to longer term outcomes-what does it all mean? [^112ZLGTd]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Neoadjuvant breast cancer trials are important for speeding up the introduction of new treatments for patients with early breast cancer and for the highly productive translational research which they facilitate. Meta-analysis of trial data shows clear correlation between pathological response at surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and longer-term outcomes at an individual patient level. However, this does not appear to be present on individual trial level analysis, when correlating improved outcome for the investigational arm for the primary endpoint (pathological response) with longer-term outcomes.

Discussion

The correlation between pathological response and longer-term outcomes in trials is dependent on many factors. These include definitions of pathological response, both complete and partial; assessment methods for pathological response at surgery; subtype and prognosis of breast cancer at diagnosis; number of patients recruited; adjuvant treatments; the mechanism of action of the investigational drug; the length of follow-up at the time of reporting; the definitions used in longer-term outcomes analysis; clonal heterogeneity; and new adaptive trial designs with additional neo/adjuvant treatments. Future developments of neoadjuvant breast cancer trials are discussed. With so many factors influencing the correlation of longer-term outcomes for trial-level data, we conclude that the main focus of neoadjuvant trials should remain the primary endpoint of pathological response. Neoadjuvant breast cancer trials are very important investigational studies that will continue to increase our understanding of the disease and offer the potential of more rapid introduction of new treatments for women with high-risk early breast cancer. In the future, we are likely to see both novel trial designs adopted in the neoadjuvant context and modifications of neo/adjuvant treatments for pathological non-responders within clinical trials. Both of these have the intention of improving longer-term outcomes for patients who do not have a good pathological response to first-line neoadjuvant treatment. If successful, these developments are likely to reduce further any positive correlation between pathological response and longer-term outcomes.

### Second-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer: who may benefit? [^113y2Skf]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Despite a declining incidence in many developed countries, gastric cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer deaths, and it is responsible for about 12% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide. As for most gastrointestinal cancers, the management of gastric cancer is based on the surgical resection of the primary tumour. However, more than two-thirds of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer will have unresectable disease, and despite the fact that surgical pathological R0 resection can be curative for many patients, recurrence rates are about 70% and 5-year survival rate is lower than 30%. For patients with unresectable disease, or developing recurrent disease after curative resection, evidence supports the use of palliative chemotherapy with the aims of improving symptoms, quality of life, and possibly prolonging survival. Several chemotherapy agents are considered active in advanced gastric cancer. Over the past decades, many anticancer drugs have been investigated, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, anthracyclines, oral fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel. Combination chemotherapy regimens have been developed in the hopes of improving response rate and overall survival (OS). Unfortunately, the benefits of combination chemotherapy have been modest. In general, regimens containing 5-FU and cisplatin are widely accepted as potential standard therapies with a response rate of 25–45% and median OS times of 7–9 months. Although a large proportion of patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer may initially respond to chemotherapy, they ultimately progress. In addition, many patients have primary refractory disease. The median survival at progression after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer is about 2.5 months.

### Risks and benefits of phase 1 oncology trials, 1991 through 2002 [^1137wHo9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous reviews of phase 1 oncology trials reported a rate of response to treatment of 4 to 6 percent and a toxicity-related death rate of 0.5 percent. These results may not reflect the rates in current phase 1 oncology trials.

Methods

We reviewed all nonpediatric phase 1 oncology trials sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at the National Cancer Institute between 1991 and 2002. We report the rates of response to treatment, of stable disease, of grade 4 toxic events, and of treatment-related deaths.

Results

We analyzed 460 trials involving 11,935 participants, all of whom were assessed for toxicity and 10,402 of whom were assessed for a response to therapy. The overall response rate (i.e., for both complete and partial responses) was 10.6 percent, with considerable variation among trials. "Classic" phase 1 trials of single investigational chemotherapeutic agents represented only 20 percent of the trials and had a response rate of 4.4 percent. Studies that included at least one anticancer agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration constituted 46.3 percent of the trials and had a response rate of 17.8. An additional 34.1 percent of participants had stable disease or a less-than-partial response. The overall rate of death due to toxic events was 0.49 percent. Of 3465 participants for whom data on patient-specific grade 4 toxic events were available, 14.3 percent had had at least one episode of grade 4 toxic events.

Conclusions

Overall response rates among phase 1 oncology trials are higher than previously reported, although they have not changed for classic phase 1 trials, and toxicity-related death rates have remained stable. Rates of response and toxicity vary, however, among the various types of phase 1 oncology trials.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111NMEtm]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage I/II NSCLC — background: Early randomized trials hinted at a beneficial effect of platinum-based therapy but overall did not provide sufficient evidence to support use of adjuvant chemotherapy. These trials clearly demonstrated that all chemotherapeutic regimens were not equivalent and that future adjuvant trials for NSCLC should avoid use of alkylating agents in favor of platinum-based regimens. With dissemination of current information, referral for adjuvant chemotherapy has changed dramatically, with an almost 100% increase in completely resected patients being referred for adjuvant consideration, yet about 30% of patients who were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy did not complete their treatment.

### The case for adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer [^112NjMbQ]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The rationale for adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer was reviewed.

Materials and Methods

A selective review of the successful experience with adjuvant therapy in other epithelial neoplasms is presented along with discussion of the increasing success of chemotherapy to improve outcomes in advanced prostate cancer.

Results

Adjuvant therapy could be effective for prostate cancer if men with high risk features, such as Gleason score 8 or greater, prostate specific antigen more than 20 ng/ml, positive surgical margins with Gleason score 7 or greater, seminal vesicle invasion or positive lymph nodes, were selectively given additional therapy after primary surgery or radiation. These individuals are easily identified by routine pathological findings and precise recurrence risks can be calculated with available nomograms. For primary radiotherapy hormonal adjuvant treatment has now been shown to produce improved disease-free and overall survival. Adjuvant radiotherapy following prostatectomy decreases biochemical relapse and local disease recurrence. Adjuvant hormonal therapy after prostatectomy is also beneficial in select patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy now has a powerful rationale since it has been shown to improve survival in other common epithelial cancers, such as those of the breast, colon and lung. Newer agents produce significant response rates in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer, even prolonging overall survival.

Conclusions

Only through dedication to a multimodality approach with all disciplines, including surgical urology, radiation therapy and medical oncology, will the promise of adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer be fully realized.

Regarding preventative measures for hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy, more specifically with respect to rate of administration, ESMO 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering monoclonal antibodies in a fractionated way in patients with malignancies with a high tumor burden and at risk of rapid tumor lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies.

### N064A (alliance): phase II study of panitumumab, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^113DhZgV]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

This North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N064A (Alliance) phase II trial evaluated upfront chemoradiotherapy incorporating the EGFR inhibitor panitumumab, followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab for unresectable, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Methods

The treatment consisted of fluoropyrimidine and panitumumab given concurrently with radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab for 3 cycles followed by maintenance panitumumab. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate and secondary endpoints included confirmed response rate (RR), OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events. Enrollment of 50 patients was planned and the study fully accrued.

Results

Fifty-two patients were enrolled, but only 51 were treated and included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 65 years and 54.9% were women. Twenty-two patients received at least 1 cycle of systemic therapy following radiotherapy, but 29 patients received chemoradiotherapy only without receiving subsequent chemotherapy after completion of chemoradiotherapy. The overall RR was 5.9% (95% CI: 1.2%-16.2%). The 12-month OS rate was 50% (95% CI: 38%-67%) which fell short of the per-protocol goal for success (51.1%). The median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5–8.6) and the median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI 7.9–15.9). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported by 88%.

Conclusion

The combination of panitumumab, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy was associated with very high rates of grades 3–4 toxicities and survival results did not meet the trial's goal for success. This regimen is not recommended for further study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00601627).

### Cancer and fertility preservation: international recommendations from an expert meeting [^111jtNEh]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy of ART in patients treated for cancer seems to be good. In a comparative study of male cancer survivors treated with ICSI using cryopreserved sperm, which were compared to non-cancer infertile males that had previously frozen sperm, the live birth rate using ART was similar in the two groups.

To our knowledge, only two studies have been published describing the offspring of patients undergoing ART conceptions with the use of fresh ejaculated or testicular semen after treatment. Ping and colleagues described the fertility outcome in 117 testicular cancer survivors. Out of 21 patients who banked their semen before starting chemotherapy, 19 achieved conception by ART (11 patients used fresh semen and 8 used cryopreserved semen). A total of 37 healthy babies were conceived with no congenital malformations or childhood malignancies. Recently, a large US experience reported the successful treatment of post-chemotherapy azoospermia with the use of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction: a total of 73 post-chemotherapy azoospermic patients who underwent ART were included. Sperm was retrieved in 37% of patients; fertilization rate by ICSI (per injected oocyte) was 57.1%, with a reported clinical pregnancy rate of 50% and an overall live birth rate of 42%. A total of 15 deliveries were described, with 5 twin births. The 20 children were healthy with no apparent abnormalities; no details on obstetric outcome were reported.

In a recent large population-based study on the outcomes of progeny born after ART in the general population, there was no increase in the overall risk of cancer among British children born after assisted conception during the 17-year study period. Increased risks of hepatoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were detected, but the absolute risks were small.

Recommendation 5

Paucity of data is available on fatherhood after cancer. Although most of the published data are reassuring, some recent conflicting results suggest a potential increased risk of birth defects particularly among the children born closer to a paternal cancer diagnosis, and caution should be taken in counseling these patients (V, B for discussion with patients); data on children conceived after ART are too scarce to draw any conclusion although in the general population, available evidence for the outcomes of progeny after ART suggests safety of the techniques themselves (V, B for discussion with patients).

### Interventions for the treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer: chemotherapy [^117JVe8u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers are the most common cancers arising in the head and neck. Treatment of oral cavity cancer is generally surgery followed by radiotherapy, whereas oropharyngeal cancers, which are more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, are managed with radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Surgery for oral cancers can be disfiguring and both surgery and radiotherapy have significant functional side effects. The development of new chemotherapy agents, new combinations of agents and changes in the relative timing of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatments may potentially bring about increases in both survival and quality of life for this group of patients. This review updates one last published in 2011.

Objectives

To determine whether chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery for oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma results in improved overall survival, improved disease-free survival and/or improved locoregional control, when incorporated as either induction therapy given prior to locoregional treatment (i.e. radiotherapy or surgery), concurrent with radiotherapy or in the adjuvant (i.e. after locoregional treatment with radiotherapy or surgery) setting.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched 4 bibliographic databases up to 15 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx, and that evaluated the addition of chemotherapy to other treatments such as radiotherapy and/or surgery, or compared two or more chemotherapy regimens or modes of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, we assessed the new included trials for their risk of bias and at least two authors extracted data from them. Our primary outcome was overall survival (time to death from any cause). Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (time to disease recurrence or death from any cause) and locoregional control (response to primary treatment). We contacted trial authors for additional information or clarification when necessary.

Main Results

We included 100 studies with 18,813 participants. None of the included trials were at low risk of bias. For induction chemotherapy, we reported the results for contemporary regimens that will be of interest to clinicians and people being treated for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to clearly demonstrate a survival benefit from induction chemotherapy with platinum plus 5-fluorouracil prior to radiotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) for death 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.04, P = 0.11; 7427 participants, 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), prior to surgery (HR for death 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.60, P = 0.77; 198 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) or prior to concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) with cisplatin (HR for death 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35, P = 0.30; 389 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of an induction chemotherapy regimen with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil plus docetaxel prior to CRT with cisplatin (HR for death 1.08, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.44, P = 0.63; 760 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy over observation only following surgery (HR for death 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22, P = 0.67; 353 participants, 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Among studies that compared post-surgical adjuvant CRT, as compared to post-surgical RT, adjuvant CRT showed a survival benefit (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03; 1097 participants, 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Primary treatment with CRT, as compared to radiotherapy alone, was associated with a reduction in the risk of death (HR for death 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83, P < 0.00001; 2852 participants, 24 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review demonstrate that chemotherapy in the curative-intent treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers only seems to be of benefit when used in specific circumstances together with locoregional treatment. The evidence does not show a clear survival benefit from the use of induction chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, surgery or CRT. Adjuvant CRT reduces the risk of death by 16%, as compared to radiotherapy alone. Concurrent chemoradiation as compared to radiation alone is associated with a greater than 20% improvement in overall survival; however, additional research is required to inform how the specific chemotherapy regimen may influence this benefit.

### Chemotherapy options for gastric cancer [^115WDtYL]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in the United States and the Western World will either present with advanced disease or have recurrence after surgery, requiring discussions of chemotherapy. The evolution of chemotherapy for gastric cancer has been mixed with excitement and disappointment. Multiple single-agent chemotherapies have been shown to be only modestly effective in advanced disease, and the search for the best combination of therapy has been difficult. Contemporary combination therapies for advanced gastric cancer, usually containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and/or cisplatin, demonstrate response rates in the 20% to 40% range, with median survivals between 6 and 12 months. While newer, standard chemotherapeutics, including the taxanes and irinotecan, may offer modest additional benefits, each requires further examination in phase III trials. Among patients with curatively resected disease, postoperative chemoradiotherapy appears to improve overall survival significantly. As a greater understanding of the molecular basis of gastric cancer is gained, the inclusion of biologic-based therapies will hopefully advance our ability to treat patients with gastric cancer more effectively.

### Association between overall survival and the tendency for cancer programs to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer [^112aZdxn]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Randomized clinical trials have found that, in patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has similar long-term survival and improved perioperative outcomes compared with primary cytoreductive surgery. Despite this, considerable controversy remains about the appropriate use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the proportion of patients who receive this treatment varies considerably among cancer programs in the US.

Objective

To evaluate the association between high levels of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration and overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This difference-in-differences comparative effectiveness analysis leveraged differential adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Commission on Cancer-accredited cancer programs in the US and included women with a diagnosis of stage IIIC and IV epithelial ovarian cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 who were followed up through the end of 2018. The data were analyzed between September 2020 and January 2021.

Exposures

Treatment in a cancer program with high levels of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration (more often than expected based on case mix) or in a program that continued to restrict its use after the 2010 publication of a clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with primary surgery for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Case mix-standardized median overall survival time and 1-year all-cause mortality assessed with a flexible parametric survival model.

Results

We identified 19 562 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.9 [12.6] years; 3.2% Asian, 8.0% Black, 4.8% Hispanic, 82.5% White individuals) who were treated in 332 cancer programs that increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 21.7% in 2004 to 2009 to 42.2% in 2010 to 2015 and 19 737 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.5 [12.6] years; 3.1% Asian, 7.7% Black, 6.5% Hispanic, 81.8% White individuals) who were treated in 332 programs that marginally increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (20.1% to 22.5%) over these periods. The standardized median overall survival times improved by similar magnitudes in programs with high (from 31.6 [IQR, 12.3–70.1] to 37.9 [IQR, 17.0–84.9] months; 6.3-month difference; 95% CI, 4.2–8.3) and low (from 31.4 [IQR, 12.1–67.2] to 36.8 [IQR, 15.0–80.3] months; 5.4-month difference, 95% CI, 3.5–7.3) use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after 2010 (difference-in-differences, 0.9 months; 95% CI, -1.9 to 3.7). One-year mortality declined more in programs with high (from 25.6% to 19.3%; risk difference, -5.2%; 95% CI, -6.4 to -4.1) than with low (from 24.9% to 21.8%; risk difference, -3.2%, 95% CI, -4.3 to -2.0) use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (difference-in-differences, -2.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to -0.5).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this comparative effectiveness research study, compared with cancer programs with low use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those with high use had similar improvements in median overall survival and larger declines in short-term mortality.

### How I treat relapsed or refractory AML [^112aFS5D]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has presented challenges for hematologists for decades. Despite numerous clinical studies, outcomes are consistently disappointing with 5-year overall survival rates of ∼10%. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at the time of second complete remission remains the only reliable option with curative potential. However, recent approval of several new agents has transformed treatment paradigms that had been in place for almost half a century in AML. This new therapeutic landscape provides the opportunity to revisit the approach to relapsed or refractory AML. Through illustrative cases, we describe our approach, which increasingly relies on specific disease biology. We focus on treatment outside of the context of clinical trials because such trials are not available in most parts of the world. Primarily, we consider age, fitness to tolerate intensive chemotherapy, remission duration, and presence of a targetable mutation to guide treatment. The coming years will inevitably bring new targets and agents that may prove most effective when combined with each other and/or chemotherapy. Future studies are needed to determine how best to implement this evolving armamentarium of treatment options, to elucidate mechanisms of resistance, and to continue the pursuit of novel drug discovery.

### Is EUS-guided drainage a suitable alternative technique in case of proximal biliary obstruction? [^1133aPBC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Artifon and colleagues, in a single-center randomized study, did not find any difference after ERCP failure between EUS-choledochoduodenostomy and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in terms of efficacy and safety, but only distal stenosis were studied (malignant involvement of the second portion of the duodenum and the major papilla). In a recent work of percutaneous transhepatic biliary metal stenting for malignant hilar obstruction looking at predictive factors for efficacy in 159 patients from a single center, Li and colleagues reported a technical success rate of 100% and a clinical success of 71.4%. These outcomes are similar to ours, except that clinical success in Li's study was defined by a decrease of only 30% at 7 days. Morbidity results from Li's study (26.4%) suggest more severe and more frequent complications than after EUBD. Direct comparisons with our results are not possible, but this indicates that EUBD and PTBD might have similar efficacies in hilar obstructions. Moreover, PTBD may need reinterventions especially when the most common two-step approach is chosen, with an external drain in place for a few days before stenting. As with Artifon and colleagues, a recent prospective study comparing EUBD in our center and PTBD by an expert interventional radiologist for proximal and distal biliary obstruction found similar success and adverse events rate but a lower number of reintervention and length of hospitalization favoring EUBD.

As long as a patient with non-curable malignant disease remains in fair condition and is willing to undergo additional treatments to extend survival and improve comfort, the current trend in clinical oncology is to offer chemotherapy whenever possible. Most chemotherapy requires good liver function and an effective biliary clearance. Effective biliary drainage is therefore a prerequisite, not only for the patient's quality of life and nutritional stabilization, but also to allow chemotherapy to be administered. We found no published result of that kind in EUBD studies, but in a retrospective study of 71 patients with advanced solid malignancies and hilar biliary obstruction treated with PTBD, chemotherapy administration was possible in 55% of patients– that is, exactly the same rate as in the present study. Moreover, EUBD in this subgroup of patients who could receive chemotherapy allowed high overall survival at 210 (32–390) days.

### Risk and benefit for umbrella trials in oncology: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116TqA4o]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbrella clinical trials in precision oncology are designed to tailor therapies to the specific genetic changes within a tumor. Little is known about the risk/benefit ratio for umbrella clinical trials. The aim of our systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles in cancer umbrella trials testing targeted drugs or a combination of targeted therapy with chemotherapy.

Methods

Our study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020171494). We searched Embase and PubMed for cancer umbrella trials testing targeted agents or a combination of targeted therapies with chemotherapy. We included solid tumor studies published between 1 January 2006 and 7 October 2019. We measured the risk using drug-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs), and the benefit by objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). When possible, data were meta-analyzed.

Results

Of the 6207 records identified, we included 31 sub-trials or arms of nine umbrella trials (N = 1637). The pooled overall ORR was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.5–25.9). The ORR for targeted therapies in the experimental arms was significantly lower than the ORR for a combination of targeted therapy drugs with chemotherapy: 13.3% vs 39.0%; p = 0.005. The median PFS was 2.4 months (95% CI 1.9–2.9), and the median OS was 7.1 months (95% CI 6.1–8.4). The overall drug-related death rate (drug-related grade 5 AEs rate) was 0.8% (95% CI 0.3–1.4), and the average drug-related grade 3/4 AE rate per person was 0.45 (95% CI 0.40–0.50).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that, on average, one in five cancer patients in umbrella trials published between 1 January 2006 and 7 October 2019 responded to a given therapy, while one in 125 died due to drug toxicity. Our findings do not support the expectation of increased patient benefit in cancer umbrella trials. Further studies should investigate whether umbrella trial design and the precision oncology approach improve patient outcomes.

### N064A (alliance): phase II study of panitumumab, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^116u9LXa]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N064A (Alliance) phase II trial evaluated upfront chemoradiotherapy incorporating the EGFR inhibitor panitumumab, followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab for unresectable, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Methods

The treatment consisted of fluoropyrimidine and panitumumab given concurrently with radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab for 3 cycles followed by maintenance panitumumab. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate and secondary endpoints included confirmed response rate (RR), OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events. Enrollment of 50 patients was planned and the study fully accrued.

Results

Fifty-two patients were enrolled, but only 51 were treated and included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 65 years and 54.9% were women. Twenty-two patients received at least 1 cycle of systemic therapy following radiotherapy, but 29 patients received chemoradiotherapy only without receiving subsequent chemotherapy after completion of chemoradiotherapy. The overall RR was 5.9% (95% CI: 1.2%-16.2%). The 12-month OS rate was 50% (95% CI: 38%-67%) which fell short of the per-protocol goal for success (51.1%). The median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5–8.6) and the median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI 7.9–15.9). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported by 88%.

Conclusion

The combination of panitumumab, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy was associated with very high rates of grades 3–4 toxicities and survival results did not meet the trial's goal for success. This regimen is not recommended for further study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00601627).

### Validation of progression-free survival rate at 6 months and objective response for estimating overall survival in immune checkpoint inhibitor trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fY3nT]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can surrogate end points, such as progression-free survival, be used to estimate overall survival in immunotherapy trials?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis using data from 60 published immunotherapy randomized clinical trials in advanced solid cancers found that 6-month progression-free survival in the immunotherapy arm estimated 12-month overall survival well using a statistical model that accounts for tumor type.

Meaning

These findings suggest that this model could assist with selecting immunotherapy agents for further testing in large randomized clinical trials and with regulatory approvals in rare cancers for which randomized trials are not feasible.

### In silico cancer immunotherapy trials uncover the consequences of therapy-specific response patterns for clinical trial design and outcome [^116hUQMb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In silico clinical trials can provide principled predictions about possible shapes of the survival curve, including the underlying hazard rates and hazard ratios, before trial execution. We generated such survival predictions using the models – fitted to the CA184–024 data (Table 3) – and changed the treatment effect parameters according to the simulated scenario. A traditional scenario would be a trial in which patients are randomized 1:1 to mono-chemotherapy or placebo. Given the direct chemotherapy effect, the PHA is generally assumed to hold for these trials. An in silico trial in which chemotherapy reduces the tumor growth rate for the entire trial duration indeed replicates these assumptions (Supplementary Fig. 2): the survival curves separate from the start of the trial, and the hazard ratio remains roughly constant over time. However, what happens if the chemotherapy effect does not last for the entire trial but for – maybe more realistically–6 months? For M1 and M2, the initial proportional separation of the survival curves is followed by a parallel decay and eventual convergence of both curves, leading to an early but transient survival benefit for the chemotherapy arm (Fig. 4 A, B). For M3, the chemotherapy effect estimated from the CA184–024 data is more profound and instead induces a permanent response (Fig. 4 C). Hence, substantial deviations from the PHA are observed in all cases, even for seemingly simple chemotherapy trials. Also, a violated PHA becomes immediately apparent when considering a more contemporary scenario of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone: through approximately the first six months, the hazard rates remain constant over time, but after that, they start to decline in the immunotherapy group (cyan line), yielding a non-constant hazard ratio over time (Fig. 4 D).

### The clinical terrain of immunotherapies in heterogeneous pancreatic cancer: unravelling challenges and opportunities [^11478hZf]. The Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer and has abysmal survival rates. In the past two decades, immunotherapeutic agents with success in other cancer types have gradually been trialled against PDACs at different stages of cancer progression, either as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, to this day, chemotherapy still prolongs the survival rates the most and is prescribed in clinics despite the severe side effects in other cancer types. The low success rates of immunotherapy against PDAC have been attributed most frequently to its complex and multi-faceted tumour microenvironment (TME) and low mutational burden. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of the immunotherapies tested in PDAC clinical trials thus far, their limitations, and potential explanations for their failure. We also discuss the existing classification of heterogenous PDACs into cancer, cancer-associated fibroblast, and immune subtypes and their potential opportunity in patient selection as a form of personalisation of PDAC immunotherapy. © 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

### Breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: the importance of local control [^114xv8zZ]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Breast-conserving therapy is a successful, well-studied, and scientifically validated treatment of early-stage breast carcinoma. This approach has enormously improved the quality of life and cosmetic outcome for appropriately selected and treated patients while achieving the same long-term survival rates as mastectomy. This article reviews the evidence showing the importance of achieving initial local control to maximize breast cancer-specific survival rates, the impact of systemic therapy on the local control rates achieved with breast-conserving therapy, the integration of chemotherapy with radiation therapy, and the role of breast magnetic resonance imaging in breast-conserving therapy.

### Relationship between progression-free survival, objective response rate, and overall survival in clinical trials of PD-1 / PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade: a meta-analysis [^114TGXMu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Progression‐free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are widely used, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)‐based, surrogate end points for overall survival (OS) in clinical trials of anticancer therapies.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Whether PFS/ORR are appropriate surrogates for OS in clinical trials of PD‐1/PD‐L1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with advanced/metastatic tumors.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Improvements in PFS and ORR are likely to translate into OS benefits with ICB; however, little or no PFS or ORR benefit did not rule out OS benefit.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Unless a lack of benefit in both PFS and ORR is observed, caution should be used when making decisions on early discontinuation of novel agent development.

Since 2014, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block activation of the PD‐1/PD‐L1 pathway have received approvals for the treatment of various advanced/metastatic solid tumors. 1 For example, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab are approved for use in metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and durvalumab is approved for use in stage III NSCLC; of these, some are approved as monotherapies and some in combination with chemotherapy, with preference of use generally based on PD‐L1 expression, prior therapy lines, or patient factors. 2, 3, 4, 5

### Objective response rate of placebo in randomized controlled trials of anticancer medicines [^115AAZVn]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Only 6 RCTs in our sample were conducted in treatment naïve patients. One could reasonably argue, therefore, that some responses observed in the placebo arm of second or subsequent line trials maybe a carryover effect from the treatments offered before the patients were enrolled onto this trial. This may be true in a few selected patients whose previous treatment was stopped due to toxicities. However, in most cases, the previous treatment will have been stopped due to disease progression and therefore, one would expect continued disease progression in absence of any treatment in the placebo arm. In any case, the ORR was instead higher in first-line trials in our analysis than in subsequent line trials.

Possible publication bias and heterogeneity of included studies are potential limitations of our study. Publication bias against negative studies could impact our results via exclusion of studies with greater placebo response rates. However, there is consistency in the reported overall placebo response rates between our study and the two previous studies conducted across different time frames. We also included studies published only in English language. Although most placebo-controlled RCTs are published in journals that publish at least the abstract in English language, there is a possibility that some placebo-controlled RCTs may have been missed with the use of English language as an inclusion criterion. However, there are no reasons to believe that placebo-controlled RCTs published in non-English language would be systematically different from those published in English language. In addition, some partial responses may also be attributed to variability in response assessment based on imaging criteria. There is also no granular data available on imaging modalities such as CT-based versus MRI-based versus PET-scan-based response assessment for patients in placebo-arm, although they wouldn't be systematically different than those for patients in the intervention arm. Furthermore, the years selected in this study may not be representative of all the studies; however there is no reason to believe that placebo response rates should differ with time. The similarity of our findings with previous studies affirms the absence of chronological impact on placebo response rates. Finally, not all tumor types have been represented in this study reflecting the advance in treatment and unsuitability of placebo monotherapy arm in some tumor types.

In conclusion, while approximately 1% of patients with advanced solid tumours will experience partial response from placebo alone, complete regression is extremely rare in absence of treatment. Patients should not expect complete regression of cancers without treatment. Regulators should not rely on response rate of cancer drugs from single arm trials for drug approval because some partial responses are possible even from placebo.

### Breast cancer sentinel node identification and classification after neoadjuvant chemotherapy-systematic review and meta analysis [^1164YgaT]. Academic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Lymphatic mapping with sentinel node biopsy has the potential to reduce the morbidity associated with breast cancer staging in women after neoadjuvant therapy.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of world literature between 1996 and 2007 of sentinel node mapping in patients with early-stage breast carcinoma after chemotherapy was undertaken. Potentially eligible studies were identified using database-specific search strategies incorporating appropriate Boolean combinations of the keywords sentinel node biopsy or sentinel node localization or lymphatic mapping; breast cancer or malignancy or neoplasm; and preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The electronic searches were augmented with a manual search of reference lists from identified articles. Successful lymph node mapping, defined as successful identification rate (SIR), and false-negative rate (FNR) was summarized using a bivariate random effects mixed model. The extent of heterogeneity was assessed using the inconsistency statistic. The effect of study level covariates, such as use of immunohistochemistry or dual mapping technique, and individual quality criteria, such as study design or multi-institution participation, on SIR and FNR were analyzed using metaregression.

Results

A total of 24 trials of 1799 subjects were reported that met eligibility criteria. All studies identified were published between 2000 and 2007. Lymph node involvement was found in 758 patients (37%) and ranged from 25% to 96% across studies. The proportion of patients who had successful lymph node mapping ranged from 63% to 100%, with 79% of studies reporting a rate of less than 95%. The summary successful identification rate was 0.896 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.860–0.923) with moderate heterogeneity. The summary FNR was 0.084 (95% CI 0.064–0.109) with no significant heterogeneity. Increasing prevalence of lymph node involvement and same-day mapping and lymph node dissection both significantly reduced the FNR.

Conclusions

The present systematic review demonstrates robust estimates of successful identification rate and false-negative rates of sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer patients. With a 90% SIR and 8% FNR, this technique is a reliable tool for planning treatment in this population as an alternative to completion axillary lymph node dissection.

### Systemic treatment of colorectal cancer [^114EPKJ3]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common noncutaneous malignancy in the United States and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Over the past 12 years, significant progress has been made in the systemic treatment of this malignant condition. Six new chemotherapeutic agents have been introduced, increasing median overall survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from less than 9 months with no treatment to approximately 24 months. For patients with stage III (lymph node positive) colon cancer, an overall survival benefit for fluorouracil-based chemotherapy has been firmly established, and recent data have shown further efficacy for the inclusion of oxaliplatin in such adjuvant treatment programs. For patients with stage II colon cancer, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial, but may be appropriate in a subset of individuals at higher risk for disease recurrence. Ongoing randomized clinical trials are evaluating how best to combine currently available therapies, while smaller studies are evaluating new agents, with the goal of continued progress in prolonging life among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and increasing cure rates among those with resectable disease.

### Impact of allocation on survival during intermittent chemotherapy shortages: a modeling analysis [^111R3Fma]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent shortages of chemotherapeutics used to treat curable malignancies are a worldwide problem that increases patient mortality. Although multiple strategies have been proposed for managing these shortages (eg, prioritizing patients by age, scarce treatment efficacy per volume, alternative treatment efficacy difference), critical clinical dilemmas arise when selecting a management strategy and understanding its impact.

Patients and Methods

We developed a model to compare the impact of different allocation strategies on overall survival during intermittent chemotherapy shortages and tested it using vincristine, which was recently scarce for 9 months in the United States. Demographic and treatment data were abstracted from 1,689 previously treated patients in our tertiary-care system; alternatives were abstracted from NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for each disease and survival probabilities from the studies cited therein. Modeled survival was validated using SEER data. Nine-month shortages were modeled for all possible supply levels. Pairwise differences in 3-year survival and risk reductions were calculated for each strategy compared with standard practice (first-come, first-served) for each 50-mg supply increment, as were supply thresholds above which each strategy maintained survival similar to scenarios without shortages.

Results

A strategy prioritizing by higher vincristine efficacy per volume and greater alternative treatment efficacy difference performed best, improving survival significantly (P < .01) across 86.5% of possible shortages (relative risk reduction, 8.3%; 99% CI, 8.0–8.5) compared with standard practice. This strategy also maintained survival rates similar to a model without shortages until supply fell below 72.2% of the amount required to treat all patients, compared with 94.3% for standard practice.

Conclusions

During modeled vincristine shortages, prioritizing patients by higher efficacy per volume and alternative treatment efficacy difference significantly improved survival over standard practice. This approach can help optimize allocation as intermittent chemotherapy shortages continue to arise.

### Postrecurrence treatment in neoadjuvant or adjuvant FDA registration trials: a systematic review [^113qKEGv]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In patients with cancer undergoing curative local treatment, neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapies aim to lower recurrences, increase cure rates, or permit less invasive surgery. Increasing cure rate applies to the whole population because some patients benefit from additional therapy while others do not, and many experience adverse effects. Patients who benefit are a minority of treated patients.

All drugs used in the adjuvant context could also be prescribed in metastatic settings. Therefore, the question in adjuvant setting is whether to treat all patients earlier despite many not benefiting or to only treat at recurrence. A valid answer is obtained if patients who have recurrence in the control arm have optimal access to therapeutic options, including drugs tested in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting when indicated. We aimed to evaluate the reporting and characteristics of postrecurrence therapy in trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration of systemic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment setting.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^112kJHjd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer — selection of patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval debulking surgery (IDS) emphasizes careful eligibility. Based on randomized trials, the NCCN Guidelines recommend considering neoadjuvant therapy for patients with bulky disease that is unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced by up-front surgery. The panel considers current evidence to be insufficient for justifying NACT as an option for patients who by assessment of a gynecologic oncologist are likely to be optimally cytoreduced by upfront surgery. When selecting patients for NACT with IDS, the cancer type of the primary tumor and potential response to primary chemotherapy should be considered. NACT is not appropriate for patients with non-epithelial cancer types (eg, sex cord-stromal or germ-cell tumors) and is not appropriate for patients with disease apparently confined to the ovary. NACT can also be considered for patients who are poor surgical candidates, such as those with poor performance score, in the hopes that tumor load reduction may improve their condition and thereby reduce perioperative risks. In at least one randomized trial, among patients aged 60 to 75 years with stage III/IV disease, NACT improved the rate of successful cytoreduction and other surgical outcomes (reduced operative time and blood loss), although no improvement in PFS or OS was observed. Across trials, the median PFS and OS for both treatment arms were inferior to those in studies of primary debulking surgery followed by postoperative IV chemotherapy for advanced disease (OS mean, ~50 months in the United States), and the median OS in the international trial is 20 months lower than that reported in US trials; this difference may have been a result of selection of higher risk patients in the NACT trials (which did not include patients with stage IIIB or earlier stages).

### Biomarkers with predictive and prognostic function in non-small cell lung cancer: ready for prime time? [^111GS8Hc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Most patients with NSCLC present with locoregionally advanced or metastatic disease, for which response rates and median overall survival remain poor. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for NSCLC in both adjuvant and metastatic disease. Personalized chemotherapy and targeted biologic therapy based on a tumor's histologic and molecular profile have already shown promise in optimizing efficacy. Various markers are currently being investigated for their ability to guide treatment decision-making and management. This article describes these predictive and prognostic markers and details their current role, benefit, and potential future use in the management of patients with NSCLC.

### The paradox of response and survival in cancer therapeutics [^115zSLAj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Although most patients with cancer respond to therapy, few are cured. Moreover, objective clinical responses to treatment often do not even translate into substantial improvements in overall survival. For example, patients with indolent lymphoma who achieved a complete remission with conventional-dose therapies in the prerituximab era did not experience a survival advantage over similar patients treated with a "watch and wait" approach. Several studies have also shown that neither the magnitude nor the kinetics of clinical response has an impact on survival in multiple myeloma. Recent data suggesting many malignancies arise from a rare population of cells that exclusively maintains the ability to self-renew and sustains the tumor (ie, "cancer stem cells") may help explain this paradox that response and survival are not always linked. Therapies that successfully eliminate the differentiated cancer cells characterizing the tumor may be ineffective against rare, biologically distinct cancer stem cells. New methods for assessing treatment efficacy must also be developed, as traditional response criteria measure tumor bulk and may not reflect changes in rare cancer stem cell populations. In this article, we discuss the evidence for cancer stem cells in hematologic malignancies and possible ways to begin targeting these cells and measuring clinical effectiveness of such treatment approaches.

### National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines: who makes them? What are they? Why are they important? [^113wB6eB]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is a not-for-profit alliance of 28 leading cancer centers dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so that patients can live better lives. The NCCN offers a number of programs and resources to give clinicians access to tools and knowledge that can help guide decision making in the management of cancer, including the flagship product, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines). The NCCN Guidelines provide evidence-based, consensus-driven guidance for cancer management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. They are intended to assist all individuals who impact decision making in cancer care, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families, and many others. The development of the NCCN Guidelines is an ongoing and iterative process based on a critical review of the best available evidence and the consensus recommendations made by a multidisciplinary panel of oncology experts. The NCCN Guidelines are the most detailed and frequently updated clinical practice guidelines available in any area of medicine and are the recognized standard for cancer care throughout the world. NCCN Guidelines are used by clinicians, payers, and other health care decision makers around the world to ensure delivery of high-quality, accessible, patient-centered care aimed at optimizing patient outcomes.

### Anal cancer: is neoadjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy friend or foe? [^116fuNWx]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the findings of the Intergroup RTOG 98–11 trial, which aimed to investigate both the potential role of cisplatin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and also its role concurrently in combination with radiotherapy, for anal-canal carcinoma. Although chemoradiotherapy has had an important effect on the treatment of anal cancer, and allows preservation of anorectal function with survival rates similar to or better than those of surgical treatment, overall survival rates for advanced tumors are still in the region of 50–60% at 5 years. A strong theoretical rationale for cisplatin-based treatment in anal cancer exists; several phase II trials have demonstrated a high response rate with reduced colostomy rates. The Intergroup results are disappointing in that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, followed by cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival, disease-free survival and locoregional control when compared with the standard treatment of combined 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin chemoradiotherapy.

### The history and future of chemotherapy for melanoma [^115MjNNN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Melanoma is considered a chemotherapy-resistant cancer, but in reality there are several chemotherapy drugs with significant single-agent activity. Response rates to combination regimens are reproducibly higher than with standard dacarbazine, but of the randomized trials comparing combination regimens with dacarbazine, none were of sufficient size to detect a realistic effect on survival. Similarly, adjuvant chemotherapy has not had a realistic test in melanoma. Response to chemotherapy is associated reproducibly with better survival rates suggesting that regimens with higher response rates are needed. Recent observations suggest that combining antiangiogenic agents with either dacarbazine or temozolomide can double response rates. These combinations are worthy of further investigation and might serve as a foundation on which to build a combination regimen that improves overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data [^112rcxtt]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Definition of outcomes

Our primary outcome, overall survival, was defined as the time from randomisation until death (any cause), with living patients censored on the date of last follow-up. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival, time to locoregional and distant recurrence, cause-specific survival, complete and overall resection rates, and postoperative mortality. There were concerns that for patients receiving their surgery immediately in the surgery-alone arm, any recurrences could be identified sooner than in the preoperative chemotherapy arm. This might erroneously suggest a benefit of chemotherapy. Thus, analyses of recurrence outcomes were calculated from a landmark time of 6 months from the date of randomisation to allow for all patients to have completed their allocated treatment. Events arising within 6 months of randomisation were regarded as events at this landmark time. Recurrence-free survival was defined as time from the landmark date until locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death, whichever happened first. Patients alive without recurrence were censored on the date of last follow-up. To avoid bias from under-reporting of subsequent events, time to locoregional (distant) recurrence was defined as time from the landmark date to first locoregional (distant) recurrence, and patients experiencing previous distant (local) recurrences were censored on the date of distant (local) recurrence. Patients experiencing a locoregional and distant recurrence on the same date were counted in both analyses. For trials that only recorded the first recurrence, patients having a local (distant) recurrence were censored in the analysis of distant (local) recurrence; all other patients without recurrence were censored on the date of death or last follow-up.

We used data on cause of death to assess the effects of chemotherapy on lung and non-lung cancer survival. However, although eight trials supplied these data, only two provided sufficiently detailed information to discriminate between treatment-related and other non-cancer causes, making it impossible to define these outcomes accurately.

The overall resection rate was defined as the proportion of patients having either a complete or incomplete resection. The complete resection rate was defined as the proportion of patients having a complete resection. Postoperative mortality was defined as the proportion of patients dying within 30 days of surgery, and early mortality was defined as death within 6 months of date of randomisation, to allow for completion of all treatment in each arm.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^115e5AYj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — methods summarize that a multidisciplinary Expert Panel developed a systematic review–based guideline, with an open comment period of 2 weeks (August 28, 2020, through September 8, 2020). Recommendations were developed using a systematic review (January 1, 2000-August 31, 2020) of randomized phase II and phase III clinical trials (RCTs) in PubMed; the search was restricted to English and to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials reporting pCR and survival end points, with broader outcome criteria (including clinical tumor objective response) for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy; and literature searches were supplemented by Panel members' personal files when no contemporary or directly relevant RCTs were available.

### Combination therapies for cancer: challenges and opportunities [^116DCkLZ]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal cancers represent a major challenge to public health. Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal cancer among all gastrointestinal cancers. Most patients cannot meet the criteria of resection at diagnosis, indicating these patients will have dismal prognosis.

Main Text

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy helps some patients regain the opportunity of radical resection. An optimal regimen of chemotherapy is one that maximizes the anti-tumor efficacy while maintaining a relatively manageable safety profile. The development of surgical procedures further improves the outcomes of these patients.

Conclusions

Combination therapies in a multidisciplinary manner that involves modified chemotherapy regimen, radical resection, and intestine auto-transplantation may provide the currently best possible care to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

### A systematic review of meta-analyses assessing the validity of tumour response endpoints as surrogates for progression-free or overall survival in cancer [^113JrR73]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Decisions about the use of new and existing health technologies should ideally be informed by estimates of treatment effects derived from high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which measure patient-relevant endpoints over a clinically appropriate timeframe. Such "final" endpoints typically involve the measurement of health benefits, which reflect aspects of the disease, and its treatment, which are important to patients (and potentially also their carers) and which relate to "how the patient feels, functions or survives". In the context of advanced/metastatic cancer, the key matter of concern is often whether the use of a given health technology leads to improvements in overall survival (OS; a final endpoint) compared to existing standard treatments. However, the estimation of treatment effects on OS may be subject to numerous problems, including potential confounding resulting from the use of post-progression treatments, insufficient study follow-up resulting in data immaturity or simply that data on OS have not been collected. In such instances, determining the impact of health technologies becomes more challenging and may rely on the use of surrogate endpoints to substitute for, and predict, a final patient-relevant clinical outcome. Potentially relevant surrogate endpoints vary according to tumour type and site, but commonly include progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and response-based outcomes, which may include overall response rate (ORR), different levels of response (e.g. complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or very good partial response [VGPR]) and duration of response (DoR). These surrogate endpoints are often considered attractive as they typically require smaller sample sizes, occur faster and are less expensive to collect in clinical trials compared with final outcomes, thereby reducing costs associated with data collection and expediting the time required for bringing new technologies to market.

### Cisplatin versus carboplatin in combination with third-generation drugs for advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^111VnNiH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

An estimated 220,000 new cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 160,000 deaths are expected to occur in the US in 2013, representing about 28% of cancer-related mortality. Approximately 75% of these people will have locally advanced or metastatic disease and will be treated in a palliative setting. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has benefits in terms of survival and symptom control when compared with best supportive care.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of carboplatin-based chemotherapy when compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, both in combination with a third-generation drug, in people with advanced NSCLC. To compare quality of life in people with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and carboplatin combined with a third-generation drug.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to 6 March 2013), EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to 6 March 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 2, 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 6 March 2013). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meetings (January 1990 to March 2013), reference lists from relevant resources and the Clinical Trial.gov database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin combined with a third-generation drug in people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We accepted any regimen and number of cycles that included these drugs, since there is no widely accepted standard regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We analysed the following endpoints: overall survival, one-year survival, quality of life, toxicity and response rate.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with 5017 people, 3973 of whom were available for meta-analysis. There was no difference between carboplatin-based and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.97, I² = 0%) and one-year survival rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09, I² = 24%). Cisplatin had higher response rates when we performed an overall analysis (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, I² = 3%), but trials using paclitaxel or gemcitabine plus a platin in both arms had equivalent response rates (paclitaxel: RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07, I² = 0%; gemcitabine: RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.16, I² = 34%). Cisplatin caused more nausea or vomiting, or both (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.67, I² = 53%) and carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia (RR 2.00; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.91, I² = 21%) and neurotoxicity (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.27, I² = 0%). There was no difference in the incidence of grade III/IV anaemia (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43, I² = 20%), neutropenia (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08, I² = 49%), alopecia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68, I² = 0%) or renal toxicity (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45, I² = 3%). Two trials performed a quality of life analysis; however, they used different methods of measurement so we could not perform a meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The initial treatment of people with advanced NSCLC is palliative, and carboplatin can be a treatment option. It has a similar effect on survival but a different toxicity profile when compared with cisplatin. Therefore, the choice of the platin compound should take into account the expected toxicity profile and the person's comorbidities. In addition, when used with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine, the drugs had an equivalent response rate.

### The role of chemotherapy in the management of newly diagnosed brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^11127nwf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Target Population

This recommendation applies to adults with newly diagnosed brain metastases; however, the recommendation below does not apply to the exquisitely chemosensitive tumors, such as germinomas metastatic to the brain.

Recommendation

Should patients with brain metastases receive chemotherapy in addition to whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)? Level 1 Routine use of chemotherapy following WBRT for brain metastases has not been shown to increase survival and is not recommended. Four class I studies examined the role of carboplatin, chloroethylnitrosoureas, tegafur and temozolomide, and all resulted in no survival benefit. Two caveats are provided in order to allow the treating physician to individualize decision-making: First, the majority of the data are limited to non small cell lung (NSCLC) and breast cancer; therefore, in other tumor histologies, the possibility of clinical benefit cannot be absolutely ruled out. Second, the addition of chemotherapy to WBRT improved response rates in some, but not all trials; response rate was not the primary endpoint in most of these trials and end-point assessment was non-centralized, non-blinded, and post-hoc. Enrollment in chemotherapy-related clinical trials is encouraged.

### State of affairs regarding targeted pharmacological therapy of cancers metastasized to the brain [^115eDzrS]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1999 a visionary short article by The Wall Street Journal writers Robert Langreth and Michael Waldholz popularized the new term "personalized medicine", that is to say, the targeting of drugs to each unique genetic profile. From today's perspective, targeted approaches have clearly found the widest use in the antineoplastic domain. The current review was initiated to review the progress that has been made regarding the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and brain metastases. PubMed was searched for the terms brain metastasis, brain metastases, or metastatic brain in the Title/Abstract. Selection was limited to randomized controlled trial (RCT) and publication date January 2010 to February 2022. Following visual review, 51 papers on metastatic lung cancer, 12 on metastatic breast cancer, and 9 on malignant melanoma were retained and underwent full analysis. Information was extracted from the papers giving specific numbers for intracranial response rate and/or overall survival. Since most pharmacological trials on advanced cancers excluded patients with brain metastases and since hardly any information on adjuvant radiotherapy and radiosurgery is available from the pharmacological trials, precise assessment of the effect of targeted medication for the subgroups with brain metastases is difficult. Some quantitative information regarding the success of targeted pharmacological therapy is only available for patients with breast and lung cancer and melanoma. Overall, targeted approaches approximately doubled the lifespan in the subgroups of brain metastases from tumors with targetable surface receptors such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion receptor in non-small cell lung cancer or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. For these types, overall survival in the situation of brain metastases is now more than a year. For receptor-negative lung cancer and melanoma, introduction of immune checkpoint blockers brought a substantial advance, although overall survival for melanoma metastasized to the brain appears to remain in the range of 6 to 9 months. The outlook for small cell lung cancer metastasized to the brain apparently remains poor. The introduction of targeted therapy roughly doubled survival times of advanced cancers including those metastasized to the brain, but so far, targeted therapy does not differ essentially from chemotherapy, therefore also facing tumors developing escape mechanisms. With the improved perspective of patients suffering from brain metastases, it becomes important to further optimize treatment of this specific patient group within the framework of randomized trials.

### Second-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer: who may benefit? [^111mq3qx]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Yet, there is no established second-line chemotherapy for gastric cancer, but it is used in 20–40% of patients. In three phase III randomised trials of 5-FU-based first-line therapy enrolling a total of 1080 patients, 20% of them went on to receive second-line chemotherapy, with a response rate observed as 13.3% (95% CI, 6.8–22.5%), and a median survival from starting second-line therapy of 5.6 months.

During the past few decades, many phase II reports of second-line therapy including gastric cancer patients have been published, but no randomised phase III trial investigating second-line chemotherapy compared with best supportive care is available. There is a great heterogeneity within each of phase II trial, partly because of the variability in the responsiveness to first-line chemotherapy, and the nature of previous chemotherapy (cisplatin-based or not). Morevover, available data have limitations because of a publication bias; trials generally include small numbers of participants and they do not support evidence for identifying patients who are more likely to benefit from second-line chemotherapy.

A decision whether starting or not second-line chemotherapy for an individual patient may be a common clinical scenario. Several factors should be considered: the potential cumulative toxicity, especially for those patients with low performance status (PS), the extent of disease, the need of active drugs, the lack of cross-resistance to drugs previously used. But second-line therapy could not be appropriate for all patients, and prediction of treatment outcome may allow for the identification of patients who would derive very little benefit from second-line chemotherapy. The aim of this analysis was to explore clinico-pathologic factors that may be associated with survival of patients treated with second-line chemotherapy. In the absence of definitive phase III trials, consideration of some of these factors, if any, may assist in the selection of patients for further treatment. However, as this analysis was performed on patients receiving cytotoxic drugs, it is not possible to extrapolate results for patients treated with novel biological agents and within clinical trials.

### Level of evidence used in recommendations by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines beyond food and drug administration approvals [^112FhfmN]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians have the responsibility to ensure that their patients receive the best possible treatment, and, at the same time, share the societal responsibility for judicious use of limited resources — two tasks that can at times appear to be in conflict. Responsible physicians not only strive to make evidence-based treatment decisions, when possible, but also consult with the patient, taking into account their wishes. The value of a therapy for a specific patient cannot be purely interpreted based on P values, hazard ratios, and survival outcomes. In addition, cancer treatment is often applicable to small numbers of patients that, especially for lethal diseases, cannot afford the time and expense that a large RCT would entail. Hence, physicians must often make decisions based on other types of compelling evidence. Cancer patients and oncologists struggling to wade through the complex, and often confusing, data emerging from clinical trials need recommendations that outline evidence-based treatment options across a variety of clinical situations, including those for which there is no FDA-approved therapy available.

### Replication of overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response in chemotherapy arms of non-small cell lung cancer trials using real-world data [^117H9uDH]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Exploration of real-world data (RWD) endpoints other than overall survival (OS) can provide valuable insights into expanding applications of RWD in drug development. This analysis explored several large RWD sets and clinical trials to develop approaches to determine whether real-world endpoints are similar to the progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and overall response rate (ORR) endpoints used in clinical trials. Applying population restriction and propensity score methods to replicate trial control arms with RWD external controls performed reasonably well for real-world PFS and OS for four selected non–small cell lung cancer trials of atezolizumab given in the first-line setting. General concordance of real-world response rates with ORR from trial data was observed. Extending this work to different treatments, tumor types, lines of therapy, and a thorough exploration of differences in scan frequencies in various settings will help provide greater insight into the utility of RWD in drug development.

### Objective response rate of placebo in randomized controlled trials of anticancer medicines [^1158ApfG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. This is a meta-analysis of trial-level data from the published literature, and individual patient level data were not collected. Therefore, in absence of individual patient level data, ethical approval was not deemed necessary.

Study selection

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed to identify all RCTs of anti-cancer drugs in patients with advanced solid tumors conducted between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2021 and published in English. The most recent study of placebo response rates in advanced solid tumors had included studies until 2014, so we decided to study the RCTs conducted after 2014, i.e. 2015–2021. Trials that met the following criteria were included: (1) assessed advanced adult solid tumours only; (2) not a (neo) adjuvant therapy; (3) did not study local therapies such as surgery or radiation, cell-based therapies, or supportive care; (4) had a sample size greater than 20 participants in each arm; (5) randomly allocated patients to either treatment or placebo arms; (6) the placebo arm was a monotherapy or was used in combination with the best supportive care (i.e. placebo was not a part of combination therapy such as chemotherapy plus placebo or immunotherapy plus placebo); (7) was not a duplicate trial or subgroup analysis; (8) measured objective response rates as outlined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST). Both phase 2 and phase 3 RCTs in either first-line or later-lines of therapy would be included, if eligible. Non-randomized trials, trials in pediatric population, trials with placebo in combination with an active treatment, and trials without response rate data were excluded. In addition, RCTs of maintenance therapies where the trial tests a maintenance therapy versus placebo after the completion of initial therapy were also excluded because any responses observed in the placebo arm could have been from the initial treatment with active anticancer agent.

### Long-term outcomes for neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of individual patient data from ten randomised trials [^1113wPC2]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for early breast cancer can make breast-conserving surgery more feasible and might be more likely to eradicate micrometastatic disease than might the same chemotherapy given after surgery. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of NACT and the influence of tumour characteristics on outcome with a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from relevant randomised trials.

Methods

We obtained information about prerandomisation tumour characteristics, clinical tumour response, surgery, recurrence, and mortality for 4756 women in ten randomised trials in early breast cancer that began before 2005 and compared NACT with the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. Primary outcomes were tumour response, extent of local therapy, local and distant recurrence, breast cancer death, and overall mortality. Analyses by intention-to-treat used standard regression (for response and frequency of breast-conserving therapy) and log-rank methods (for recurrence and mortality).

Findings

Patients entered the trials from 1983 to 2002 and median follow-up was 9 years (IQR 5–14), with the last follow-up in 2013. Most chemotherapy was anthracycline based (3838 [81%] of 4756 women). More than two thirds (1349 [69%] of 1947) of women allocated NACT had a complete or partial clinical response. Patients allocated NACT had an increased frequency of breast-conserving therapy (1504 [65%] of 2320 treated with NACT vs 1135 [49%] of 2318 treated with adjuvant chemotherapy). NACT was associated with more frequent local recurrence than was adjuvant chemotherapy: the 15 year local recurrence was 21.4% for NACT versus 15.9% for adjuvant chemotherapy (5.5% increase [95% CI 2.4–8.6]; rate ratio 1.37 [95% CI 1.17–1.61]; p = 0.0001). No significant difference between NACT and adjuvant chemotherapy was noted for distant recurrence (15 year risk 38.2% for NACT vs 38.0% for adjuvant chemotherapy; rate ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.92–1.14]; p = 0.66), breast cancer mortality (34.4% vs 33.7%; 1.06 [0.95–1.18]; p = 0.31), or death from any cause (40.9% vs 41.2%; 1.04 [0.94–1.15]; p = 0.45).

Interpretation

Tumours downsized by NACT might have higher local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy than might tumours of the same dimensions in women who have not received NACT. Strategies to mitigate the increased local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy in tumours downsized by NACT should be considered — eg, careful tumour localisation, detailed pathological assessment, and appropriate radiotherapy.

### Relationship between effects on time-to-disease progression and overall survival in studies of metastatic breast cancer [^112DUQXK]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Most studies of anticancer agents are designed and powered to show differences between groups on disease progression end points such as response rates, time-to-progression, time-to-recurrence or disease-free survival. Although increased survival time is clearly an implicit goal, it is difficult to establish in randomised studies when standard clinical practise is to change treatments at the onset of new progressive events. Especially in the metastatic setting, where expected survival time may be very short, the use of drug combinations or sequential use of multiple drug classes is commonplace. Increasingly, patients in clinical trials are offered alternate treatment upon progression. Consequently, few studies actually demonstrate an unequivocal survival benefit using intent-to-treat analysis approaches.

In several tumour types, efforts have been made to justify the use of alternate, more easily established end points by showing how well they are correlated with survival. Several meta-analyses have been published (Table 1) that show a link between time-to-progression (TTP) or progression-free survival (PFS) with overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer and colon cancer in the adjuvant setting. For breast cancer, a moderately strong correlation between 2-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival was observed in the adjuvant setting. A meta-analysis of metastatic breast cancer studies found a positive relationship between objective response and overall survival on an individual patient basis, but the relationship was less clear when treatment regimens were compared. The authors questioned whether the relationship was strong enough to support objective response rate as a valid surrogate of survival when comparing treatments. Articles by two groups examined the association with survival of several potential surrogate end points, specifically in studies of anthracyclines for advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

We performed a broad-based structured review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in metastatic breast cancer. The objective of this research was to document and model the relationship between time-to-disease progression and OS in metastatic breast cancer studies across the literature.

Materials and Methods

Study Search

The review was conducted per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify peer‐reviewed English journal articles or congress abstracts, andto identify clinical trials with results reporting the impact of RDI or therapy dose delays and/or dose reductions on survival in adult patients with cancer treated with nonadjuvant‐based chemotherapy. No other gray literature was considered. Search strings included terms for neoplasms, RDI, and survival (supplemental online Table 1). The search strategy was adapted to meet the search specifications of each included database and was designed to capture outcomes of interest and stratification variables in the scope of the literature review. These were translated into indexed Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and plain language text‐word terms using the National Library of Medicine MeSH thesaurus. Boolean operators were used to combine the final list of search terms into a comprehensive search strategy adding limit filters of language and date to ensure only the most relevant studies were included in the final search yield. Studies published prior to 2013 were filtered in the initial review of search results based on the Havrilesky et al. 2015 review article having an upper date limit of 2013.

Study Selection

Study selections were documented through DistillerSR, a specialized software program designed for tracking and managing literature reviews, resulting in a fully auditable and transparent review process. Study eligibility criteria were defined a priori by study population, interventions, and outcomes (Table 1). Studies reporting a measure of RDI or treatment dose delays and/or reductions and evaluating overall and/or progression‐free survival were included. Eligible publications included prospective or retrospective observational studies, case series of ≥ 20 patients, and clinical trials. Studies reporting RDI and the cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities during treatment were also evaluated. Articles identified in the literature searches were uploaded into DistillerSR and de‐duplicated by title and author. Studies were then screened by title and abstract against the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 10% of the abstracts were evaluated by an independent reviewer for quality control (QC). Articles designated as relevant were evaluated at full‐text level by two reviewers independently to determine agreement on inclusion (100% QC). The screening results were recorded, maintained, and assessed using DistillerSR.

### Chemo benefits women at high risk of breast cancer… [^1117AyYG]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

The 10, 000-patient trial investigated the use of the Oncotype DX test to help guide the care of women with hormone receptor‒positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that has not spread to lymph nodes. This diagnosis accounts for half of all breast cancer cases in the United States each year. Predicting Chemotherapy Benefit In the new analysis, published September 30 in JAMA Oncology, the researchers wanted to determine the outcomes of the women in the trial with high recurrence scores, who were assigned to receive both hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Analyzing data from the 1, 389 women in TAILORx with high recurrence scores, the researchers estimated that, at 5 years, more than 90% of the women had not had their cancer return near the site of their original tumor or elsewhere in the body, such as the brain or liver, and 95. 9% were still alive. The findings also showed that the choice of chemotherapy regimen did not seem to influence outcomes.

Clinicians treating women in the trial could select one of several chemotherapy regimens. The most common included a taxane and cyclophosphamide, an anthracycline without a taxane, and an anthracycline and a taxane. After 5 years, women who had treatment with any of these regimens, along with hormone therapy, had similar rates of remaining free from cancer recurrence. Using the statistical method, the researchers estimated that 78. 8% of the women who received hormone therapy alone would be free of recurrence at 5 years. This comparison "is not a substitute for a randomized trial, but we'll never be able to do a randomized trial in this specific population because the benefits of chemotherapy for this group are very clear, " Dr. Sparano explained. "What this analysis provides is a better assessment of what the benefit from chemotherapy is in patients who have a recurrence score within the 26‒100 range".

He added that despite receiving chemotherapy, the women with high recurrence scores had worse outcomes than the women with intermediate scores who received hormone therapy alone. "However, we can see that the outcomes are much better than they would have been if this group of patients had therapy alone, " he said. "One of the major strengths of this analysis is that it's the largest prospective trial that's ever been conducted in patients who have high recurrence scores, and the use of chemotherapy by the clinicians reflects real-world practice, " he added.

### Indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^111CeR13]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment –Health Professional Version. Aggressive NHL has a worse prognosis in the short term, but a significant number of patients can be cured with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens. More than 70% of patients with aggressive NHL can be cured. Most relapses occur in the first 2 years after therapy. The risk of late relapse is higher in patients who manifest both indolent and aggressive histologies. Although indolent NHL responds quickly to immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, a continuous rate of relapse is usually seen in advanced stages. However, patients can often be re-treated with considerable success if the disease histology remains low grade. Patients who present with, or convert to, aggressive forms of NHL may have sustained complete remissions with combination chemotherapy regimens or aggressive consolidation with marrow or stem cell support.

16, 22, 23] A series of 605 patients who received autologous bone marrow transplant with cyclophosphamide and total-body radiation therapy were followed for a median of 10 years. The incidence of a second malignancy was 21%, and 10% of those malignancies were solid tumors. Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21, 690 survivors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia, meningitis, immunoglobulin deficiency, and autoimmune cytopenias. Similarly, there are impaired humoral responses to COVID-19 virus vaccination in patients with lymphoma who receive B-cell–directed therapies.

For patients with follicular lymphoma, a positive PET result after therapy has a worse prognosis; however, it is unclear whether a positive PET result is predictive when further or different therapy is implemented.

### Chemotherapy use, performance status, and quality of life near death… [^117BLPC4]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chemotherapy use was not associated with patient survival controlling for clinical setting and patients' performance status. Among patients with good baseline performance status, chemotherapy use compared with nonuse was associated with worse QOD. Despite the lack of evidence to support the practice, chemotherapy is widely used in cancer patients with poor performance status and progression following an initial course of palliative chemotherapy. 1, 4, 10, 11 A study of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer found that 28% of patients had performance status scores of 3 or 4 at presentation and that nearly 40% of these patients were receiving chemotherapy. 12 Available data for patients with NSCLC show a response rate of 2% for third-line and 0% for fourth-line chemotherapy. 13 This situation is not unique to NSCLC.

A Norwegian study characterizing patients receiving palliative chemotherapy at a regional cancer center revealed that 53% had a performance status score of 2 and 16%, performance status scores of 3 and 4 at the start of last cancer therapy. 14 Overall, 10% received chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life. Among those patients, 21% had lung cancer; 15%, colorectal; 13%, prostate; and 9%, breast cancer. Of the breast cancer patients, 12% were receiving second-line therapy 15 19%, third-line therapy 16, 17; and 21%, third-line therapy or higher. Of cancer patients with progressive metastatic disease, 50. 6% were receiving chemotherapy at study entry, a median of 4 months prior to death. Chemotherapy use was more frequent in patients with good compared with poorer performance status. Chemotherapy use among patients with good baseline performance status was associated with lower QOD (OR, 0. 35; 95% CI,

### More chemotherapy may help after initial treatment for childhood leukemia fails… [^11633Atd]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

More Chemotherapy May Help after Initial Treatment for Childhood Leukemia Fails Adapted from the NCI Cancer Bulletin. A small percentage of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia responds poorly to initial chemotherapy. When this initial treatment, called induction therapy, fails to induce a complete clinical remission, most leukemia experts would recommend an allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, a new study suggests that at least some of these children may do better if they receive additional chemotherapy rather than a stem cell transplant. Reporting their findings in the April 12, 2012, New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers noted that doctors can cure 8 in 10 children newly diagnosed with ALL. But certain subgroups of patients tend to do worse than others. For instance, patients whose cancers do not go into complete clinical remission after 4 to 6 weeks of induction therapy are at high risk for poor outcomes.

To determine the optimal treatment for these patients, the researchers analyzed data on more than 44, 000 children who participated in ALL clinical trials around the world. Of these children, 1, 041 had cancers that responded poorly to induction therapy. Most of these patients went on to have a stem cell transplant, but some received only additional chemotherapy. A subset of the children whose cancers did not respond to induction therapy unexpectedly showed better long-term survival with chemotherapy alone than with stem cell transplantation. These children were younger than age 6, had precursor B-cell ALL rather than T-cell ALL, and had no other high-risk clinical or genetic features. More than 70 percent of the children in the subgroup that received additional chemotherapy rather than a stem cell transplant survived at least 10 years, which was more than twice the survival rate of the entire group of patients who did not respond to induction therapy.

"This study tells us that the failure of induction therapy should no longer be considered an automatic indication for a bone marrow transplant, " said co-author Ching-Hon Pui, M. D., chair of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital department of oncology. "a 72 percent survival rate is still not acceptable, and we need to find better ways to treat these patients, " he added. The study also demonstrates "the power of large collaborative efforts to discover important new insights into disease, " said Karen Rabin, M. D., of Baylor College of Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial. The benefit of chemotherapy for these patients emerged only after 14 research groups on three continents combined their results.
