## Question

What are common causes of vitamin D deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of vitamin D deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental sources and physiology of vitamin D to anchor causation. Then, I should examine environmental contributors, especially sunlight and UVB availability. Next, I will consider dietary intake and malabsorption, followed by demographic and physiologic risk factors. After that, I should review medication effects and disease states that impair activation or increase catabolism. Finally, I will identify special high‑risk populations and synthesize a prioritized list, cross‑checking against high‑credibility guidelines to self‑verify the conclusions.

> Let me first confirm the physiology and the biomarker before attributing causes, because if I misstate the biology the causal chain will be off. Vitamin D is acquired predominantly via cutaneous UVB conversion of 7‑dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol, with a smaller fraction from diet; it is 25‑hydroxylated in the liver and 1‑alpha‑hydroxylated in the kidney to the active form, and serum 25‑hydroxyvitamin D is the principal index of status due to its longer half‑life, not 1,25‑dihydroxyvitamin D, which should generally not be used for deficiency evaluation in at‑risk patients, so I need to ensure I rely on 25(OH)D when discussing deficiency drivers [^1123HSa4] [^11417Mw1].

> Now, I should clarify the dominant causal pathway. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence linking sunlight to status. High‑credibility evidence shows ambient UV radiation and total vitamin D intake are the strongest predictors of 25(OH)D, with ambient UVB usually dominating, which supports insufficient sun/UVB exposure as the principal global cause of low vitamin D status, especially in settings with low fortification or supplementation [^113DFK9U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms within the sun‑exposure domain; I should enumerate the concrete modifiers of UVB availability. Living at higher latitudes and during winter–spring substantially lowers cutaneous synthesis, indoor lifestyles and limited time outdoors reduce exposure, cultural or concealing clothing limits skin surface area, and air pollution attenuates UVB, so these environmental and behavioral constraints converge to lower 25(OH)D concentrations in many populations [^114QNBg8] [^116754JX] [^114rfqdw] [^113DFK9U].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine sunscreen use universally causes vitamin D deficiency; let me double‑check that assumption. An expert consensus indicates that broad‑spectrum sunscreens that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations, although patients with photosensitivity disorders who require rigorous photoprotection are at risk and warrant screening and supplementation, so I should correct my earlier inclination to overstate sunscreen as a general cause [^115xnr1L].

> Next, I should review the dietary and gastrointestinal contributors, because although diet is a smaller source, insufficiency here compounds low UV exposure. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D and fortification often does not meet requirements, so low intake contributes, and malabsorption states such as inflammatory bowel disease and post‑bariatric surgery impair absorption and increase requirements; magnesium deficiency may further impair vitamin D metabolism as a cofactor, though this link is preliminary and I should be cautious in overstating causality [^113DFK9U] [^112bmgjr] [^116p1oAq] [^114tvLJq] [^116T4Hqe] [^115yxhMs].

> I will now examine demographic and physiologic risk factors that shift synthesis or distribution. Darker skin pigmentation reduces cutaneous vitamin D synthesis efficiency, older age lowers skin production capacity, and obesity sequesters vitamin D in adipose tissue leading to lower circulating 25(OH)D and higher dose needs; pregnancy and lactation increase requirements and frequently coincide with inadequate intake, so these groups merit heightened attention and often higher supplementation targets [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] [^113DFK9U] [^111TsKkR] [^115rP1Fz] [^117GUmKc].

> I need to check medication‑induced causes that accelerate catabolism or impair activation. Anticonvulsants, systemic glucocorticoids, certain antifungals like ketoconazole, and some antiretroviral therapies increase vitamin D metabolism or interfere with pathways, necessitating 2–3 times higher vitamin D intakes to maintain levels, so I should explicitly include medication exposure when attributing deficiency in clinical practice [^111TsKkR] [^1159qZwp] [^115rP1Fz] [^114tvLJq].

> Let me consider disease states that directly impair activation or metabolism, but I should be precise to avoid misattribution. Chronic kidney disease reduces renal 1‑alpha hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to its active form, liver disease can impair 25‑hydroxylation, and rare genetic defects in the vitamin D receptor cause resistance resembling deficiency; I initially listed hyperparathyroidism as a cause of vitamin D deficiency, but hold on, I should verify the directionality: primary hyperparathyroidism is more commonly exacerbated by or associated with vitamin D deficiency, and guidelines recommend correcting low 25(OH)D in PHPT while monitoring calcium, so I should correct my earlier implication and frame HPT as an associated condition rather than a primary cause [^114tvLJq] [^113DFK9U] [^114K13xo] [^1135x1et] [^114FEWuH] [^112gUCgY].

> Next, I should review special populations at particularly high risk to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable. Exclusively breastfed infants often have low vitamin D intake and limited sun exposure, institutionalized or hospitalized individuals typically have minimal outdoor exposure, and patients with photosensitivity disorders requiring strict photoprotection are at risk and appropriate for targeted screening and supplementation, so these groups should be flagged in practice [^116tjho3] [^117WtLR4] [^113cP2er] [^114uTrcj] [^115xnr1L].

> Let me now synthesize and prioritize, but I should double‑check alignment with high‑credibility guidelines before finalizing. First, inadequate sun or UVB exposure is the primary global driver, especially at higher latitudes and during winter–spring and in those with limited outdoor time; second, insufficient dietary intake contributes meaningfully where fortification or supplementation is low; third, malabsorption syndromes including IBD and post‑bariatric surgery are common medical causes; fourth, obesity lowers circulating 25(OH)D and increases requirements; fifth, darker skin pigmentation reduces synthesis; sixth, older age reduces cutaneous production; seventh, medications like anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, antifungals, and antiretrovirals increase catabolism; eighth, chronic diseases such as CKD and liver disease impair activation; ninth, environmental factors such as pollution and seasonality further depress levels; tenth, magnesium deficiency may contribute but remains less certain; eleventh, rare genetic receptor defects cause resistance, and this hierarchy is consistent with Endocrine Society guidance and contemporary risk modeling that emphasize ambient UV radiation and intake as the dominant predictors while discouraging general population screening [^114tvLJq] [^113DFK9U] [^112a2CfF].

> Before concluding, I should verify that my emphasis on targeted evaluation rather than routine screening is consistent with current recommendations. High‑credibility guidance advises against routine 25(OH)D testing in asymptomatic general populations, endorsing risk‑stratified assessment focused on the groups above, which aligns with the causal structure I outlined and supports prioritizing prevention and empiric supplementation strategies in high‑risk settings rather than broad testing [^113DFK9U] [^112a2CfF] [^116h8rEF].

Vitamin D deficiency is primarily caused by **insufficient sun exposure** (UVB) [^113DFK9U] — especially at high latitudes, during winter [^114QNBg8], or with predominantly indoor lifestyles [^113TRypV] — and by **inadequate dietary intake** given the scarcity of natural food sources [^112bmgjr] [^11271EhQ]. Additional causes include **malabsorption syndromes** (celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) [^114tvLJq], chronic liver or kidney disease, obesity (sequestration in fat), dark skin pigmentation [^1144Ymwq], aging (reduced skin synthesis) [^113DFK9U], exclusive breastfeeding without supplementation [^116tjho3], and medications that increase vitamin D catabolism (antiepileptics, glucocorticoids) [^111TsKkR]. Magnesium deficiency can also impair **vitamin D metabolism** [^116T4Hqe] [^115yxhMs]. Routine screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^112abct4] [^112a2CfF]; **targeted testing** is advised for high-risk groups [^113DFK9U] [^116h8rEF].

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

### Insufficient sunlight exposure

- **Latitude and season**: UVB decreases with latitude and in winter, reducing cutaneous synthesis [^114rfqdw].
- **Indoor lifestyle**: Prolonged indoor time limits UVB exposure [^113DFK9U].
- **Clothing and sunscreen**: Covering clothing and sunscreen reduce UVB exposure [^113TRypV] [^113qJMQH].

---

### Dietary insufficiency

Few foods naturally contain **vitamin D**; fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods are the primary sources [^112bmgjr] [^11271EhQ]. Low intake or lack of **fortification** increases deficiency risk [^113DFK9U].

---

## Physiological and demographic factors

### Skin pigmentation

Darker skin reduces cutaneous **vitamin D synthesis** because melanin absorbs UVB [^113TRypV], thereby decreasing conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.

---

### Age

Older adults have reduced cutaneous **vitamin D synthesis** [^113TRypV] and often have **less sun exposure** [^113DFK9U].

---

### Obesity

In obesity, vitamin D is sequestered within **adipose tissue** [^114tvLJq], lowering its bioavailability and circulating levels.

---

### Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy and lactation increase **vitamin D requirements** [^111U4Jbv]; **without supplementation**, the higher demand can lead to deficiency [^117GUmKc].

---

## Medical conditions and medications

### Malabsorption syndromes

- **Celiac disease**: Impairs absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D [^114tvLJq].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Reduces absorption and increases deficiency risk [^116p1oAq].
- **Bariatric surgery**: Alters GI anatomy, reducing absorption [^116p1oAq].

---

### Chronic diseases

Chronic kidney disease impairs **1α-hydroxylation** to active 1,25(OH)2D [^114tvLJq], and **chronic liver disease** reduces 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)D.

---

### Medications

Certain antiepileptics increase **catabolism of vitamin D** [^111TsKkR], and **glucocorticoids** also increase catabolism and reduce bioavailability [^115rP1Fz].

---

## Genetic and metabolic factors

### Genetic polymorphisms

Genetic variation in the **vitamin D pathway** can lower 25(OH)D concentrations [^113DFK9U]; **polymorphisms** in VDR, CYP2R1, and GC are implicated [^114rfqdw].

---

### Magnesium deficiency

Magnesium is a required **cofactor** for vitamin D metabolism [^116T4Hqe], and **deficiency** impairs the hydroxylation steps needed to activate vitamin D [^115yxhMs].

---

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^113TRypV]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem caused mainly by insufficient exposure to sunlight. It is estimated that 1 billion people have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency worldwide, particularly among the elderly. Vitamin D exists in two forms — D2 (ergocalciferol), obtained from yeast and plants, and D3 (cholecalciferol), obtained from the diet through the ingestion of vitamin D-containing products such as fatty fish and eggs, vitamin D-fortified milk or margarine, and the use of multivitamins. However, the primary source of vitamin D3 (80–90% of the body stores) is via ultraviolet irradiation of the precursor molecule 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.

Vitamin D (D2 and D3) is then subsequently hydroxylated in the liver by 25-hydroxylase to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). 25OHD is further hydroxylated in the kidneys by the 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme to form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), or calcitriol, which is the biologically active form of vitamin D. The 1-alpha hydroxylation can also occur in a multitude of other tissues, generating locally active vitamin D, which leads to auto and/or paracrine effects.

The principal index of vitamin D status is the serum 25OHD concentration, which has a half-life of approximately three weeks, compared to the biologically active form 1,25(OH)2D, which has a much shorter half-life of only 4–6 hours.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113DFK9U]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In populations with a low prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, screening the general population is not cost-effective. The decision to assess an individual should be made using a risk stratification approach for vitamin D deficiency. Prioritized screening for high-risk groups could be beneficial due to the potential adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal and overall health, especially when serum 25(OH)D levels are less than 30 nmol/L (< 12 ng/mL).

Boosted regression tree models have been developed from RCT data to predict serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Several predictor variables of deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L have been identified from training and validation data sets in the D-Health trial. The two strongest predictors were ambient UV radiation and total intake of vitamin D. Other important predictors of mild vitamin D deficiency include time spent outdoors, alcohol consumption, BMI, quality of life measures, and physical activity. A lack of ambient UVB radiation and vitamin D fortification of food or the use of vitamin D supplements will likely result in poor vitamin D status, especially in individuals with additional risk factors.

In conclusion, screening for optimal vitamin D status in the general population should be avoided as it is not informative and imposes a considerable economic burden. However, several characteristics and pathological conditions in the general population could place individuals at risk for severe deficits.

### Magnesium deficit: Overlooked cause of low vitamin D status [^116T4Hqe]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Like vitamin D deficit, magnesium deficit is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several steps in the vitamin D metabolism, such as vitamin D binding to its transport protein and the conversion of vitamin D into the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by hepatic and renal hydroxylation, depend on magnesium as a cofactor.

A new analysis of two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets, published in BMC Medicine, investigated potential interactions between magnesium intake, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (which is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status), and mortality. Data indicate a reduced risk of insufficient/deficient vitamin D status with high magnesium intake and an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with magnesium intake above the median.

The study provides important findings concerning potential metabolic interactions between magnesium and vitamin D and their clinical relevance. However, results should be considered preliminary since biochemical data on individual magnesium status were lacking, confounding cannot be excluded, and questions on the dose-response relationship still remain to be answered.

### Vitamin D deficiency: a worldwide problem with health consequences [^112bmgjr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure, in moderation, is the major source of vitamin D for most humans. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and foods that are fortified with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's vitamin D requirement. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and will precipitate and exacerbate osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults. It has been associated with an increased risk of common cancers, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and infectious diseases.

A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 75 nmol/L, or 30 ng/mL, is required to maximize vitamin D's beneficial effects for health. In the absence of adequate sun exposure, at least 800–1000 IU of vitamin D3 per day may be needed to achieve this in children and adults. Vitamin D2 may be equally effective for maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D when given in physiologic concentrations.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114tvLJq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency can be associated with several conditions and factors, including malabsorption, increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bariatric surgery. It may also be linked to corticosteroid use, bone pain, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rickets, osteopenia, myalgia, history of fracture, and bowed legs. Additionally, muscle weakness, decreased serum calcium, hip pain, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, osteoporosis, and decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with this deficiency. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), anticonvulsants, limited sun exposure, and dark skin color are other potential associations.

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^116s7MJA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail significantly in logic, science, and effective public health guidance. Moreover, by neglecting to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach represents precisely the wrong model for developing nutritional policy.

### A systematic review supporting the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various prevalent medical conditions. To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the prevention of disease, we conducted a systematic review.

We searched multiple databases for studies addressing 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Among these questions, 10 assessed the effect of vitamin D vs. no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes. One question evaluated dosing, and three addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Electronic searches yielded 37,007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested a reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on selected outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years, with variable certainty of evidence. A very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years was observed with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefits on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested a reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls compared to lower-dose daily dosing.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^112Yn4sg]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, the OC 2023 guidelines recommend advising daily supplementation of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU in adults aged over 50 years. This, in addition to consuming vitamin D-rich foods, is suggested to achieve the recommended dietary allowance of 600 IU/day in individuals aged 51–70 years and 800 IU/day in individuals aged over 70 years, since it is difficult to achieve this level of intake because few foods contain vitamin D.

### Vitamin D deficiency an important, common, and easily treatable cardiovascular risk factor [^113Uz9dq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, present in approximately 30% to 50% of the general population. A growing body of data suggests that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may adversely affect cardiovascular health. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and can predispose individuals to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency causes an increase in parathyroid hormone, which increases insulin resistance and is associated with diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Epidemiologic studies have associated low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Vitamin D supplementation is simple, safe, and inexpensive. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to firmly establish the relevance of vitamin D status to cardiovascular health. In the meanwhile, monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and correction of vitamin D deficiency are indicated for the optimization of musculoskeletal and general health.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine: What clinicians need to know [^1128upyg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Serum 25OHD levels and screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for the medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools.

In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of the available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider the management of patients under their care.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^115xnr1L]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Global concern about vitamin D deficiency has fueled debates on photoprotection and the importance of solar exposure to meet vitamin D requirements. The objective of this study was to review the published evidence to reach a consensus on the influence of photoprotection by sunscreens on vitamin D status, considering other relevant factors.

An international panel of 13 experts in endocrinology, dermatology, photobiology, epidemiology, and biological anthropology reviewed the literature prior to a one-day meeting in June 2017, during which the evidence was discussed. Methods of assessment, determining factors of vitamin D status, and public health perspectives were examined. The consequences of sun exposure and the effects of photoprotection were also assessed.

- **Results**: A serum level of ≥ 50 nmol/L 25D is a target for all individuals. Broad-spectrum sunscreens that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations. Vitamin D screening should be restricted to those at risk of hypovitaminosis, such as patients with photosensitivity disorders who require rigorous photoprotection. Screening and supplementation are advised for this group.

- **Conclusions**: Sunscreen use for daily and recreational photoprotection does not compromise vitamin D synthesis, even when applied under optimal conditions.

Knowledge of the relationship between solar exposure behavior, sunscreen use, and vitamin D is important for public health, but there is confusion about optimal vitamin D status and the safest way to achieve it.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D levels below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These groups comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use certain concomitant medications (e.g. anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (e.g. denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^117VCote]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves an extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been demonstrated to act as a key transcription factor in most cells, regulating a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of the VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism, which do not depend solely on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D dietary intake.

In addition to the potential utility of evaluating noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is currently the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status. However, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international guidelines need further refinement.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111dG7rW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in pediatric patients, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring at least 2–3 times more vitamin D intake for their age group. This is to satisfy the vitamin D requirements in children with obesity or those on medications such as anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole), and medications for AIDS.

### Nutritional rickets: Deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or both [^116tjho3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Nutritional rickets remains a public health problem in many countries, despite dramatic declines in its prevalence in many developed nations since the discoveries of vitamin D and the role of ultraviolet light in prevention. The disease continues to be problematic among certain groups, especially infants who are exclusively breast-fed, infants and children of dark-skinned immigrants living in temperate climates, infants and their mothers in the Middle East, and infants and children in many developing countries in the tropics and subtropics, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Bangladesh.

Vitamin D deficiency remains the major cause of rickets among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and its metabolites. Social and religious customs or climatic conditions often prevent adequate ultraviolet light exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, these factors do not apply. Studies indicate that the disease occurs among older toddlers and children and is probably attributable to low dietary calcium intakes. This is characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited variety and little access to dairy products. In such situations, calcium supplements alone result in healing of the bone disease.

Studies involving Asian children and African American toddlers suggested that low dietary calcium intakes lead to increased catabolism of vitamin D and the development of both vitamin D deficiency and rickets. Dietary calcium deficiency and vitamin D deficiency represent two ends of the spectrum of nutritional rickets.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: Variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^114rfqdw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide, but the proportions vary widely between regions, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and the accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% of variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%. Organizations and societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations is still debated.

This article, along with the accompanying online supporting information, highlights sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while keeping efficacy and safety data as dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels. We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40 ng/mL (50 to 100 nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20 ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60 ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while taking season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation into account.

We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and recommend the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^111HyF5g]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people receive at least the recommended amount of vitamin D through dietary supplements for their respective countries. The recommended daily amount in the UK is 400 IU, while in the US, it is 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age and 800 IU for those over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors may require more, but current recommendations do not address their specific needs. Higher intakes of vitamin D are likely safe, provided they remain well under 4000 IU per day.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Dd4sy]. The Lancet Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with non-communicable and infectious diseases; however, the vitamin D status of African populations is not well characterized. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among children and adults living in Africa.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, researchers searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, African Journals Online, and African Index Medicus for studies on vitamin D prevalence published from database inception to August 6, 2019, without language restrictions. All studies measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations from healthy participants residing in Africa were included. However, studies were excluded if they were case reports, case series, measured 25(OH)D only following a clinical intervention, or were only meeting abstracts or unpublished material. A standardized data extraction form was used to collect information from eligible studies. If the required information was unavailable in the published report, raw data were requested from the authors. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in African populations, using established cutoffs and mean 25(OH)D concentrations. Meta-analyses were stratified by participant age, geographical region, and residence in rural or urban areas. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018112030.

The search identified 1692 studies, of which 129 studies with 21,474 participants from 23 African countries were included in the systematic review.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses.

Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to the enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes.

- **Administration routes**: Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations.
- **Cholecalciferol and alternatives**: Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo.

Further studies are needed to strengthen these preliminary findings.

### The effect of vitamin D status on risk factors for cardiovascular disease [^112n8hDy]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin-D-related pathways are implicated in various endocrine, inflammatory, and endothelial functions. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, and undiagnosed vitamin D deficiency is common. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with substantial increases in the incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke, as well as in diseases such as chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Low vitamin D levels also upregulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increase inflammation, and cause endothelial dysfunction. However, the role of vitamin D deficiency in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is an emerging and hotly debated topic. Epidemiological studies suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but a causal relationship has not been established, and clinical trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated convincing evidence that vitamin D therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes. Some evidence suggests that vitamin D status is a biomarker of lifestyle, since unhealthy and sedentary lifestyles are associated with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and are also risk factors for cardiovascular complications.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning pediatric patients, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 for at least six weeks. Alternatively, an option is administering 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once weekly for at least six weeks, followed by maintenance therapy of 600–1,000 IU/day. This is advised for pediatric patients aged 1–18 years with vitamin D deficiency to achieve a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) extends beyond…

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence regarding whether 600 IU/day is adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be necessary to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently above 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D deficiency in childhood: old lessons and current challenges [^1179xskG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D in childhood is a re-emerging public health problem in developed countries. New lifestyle habits, the current "epidemics" of obesity in children and adolescents worldwide, and other preventable risk factors may contribute to the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency. In addition to skeletal consequences, hypovitaminosis D is involved in the development of serious health extra-skeletal problems in childhood, including atopy and autoimmunity.

The increasing concerns about the global health impact of vitamin D deficiency necessitate further research to fill knowledge gaps in this field, particularly to establish universally accepted "normal" serum 25(OH)D levels in the pediatric population and to improve strategies for the screening, prevention, and treatment of hypovitaminosis D. This review discusses the key points of hypovitaminosis D in childhood in light of new knowledge and highlights the limitations of strategies to control this condition.

### Vitamin D deficiency induces early signs of aging in human bone, increasing the risk of fracture [^116W4w3z]. Science Translational Medicine (2013).

Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread medical condition that plays a major role in human bone health. Fracture susceptibility in the context of low vitamin D has been primarily associated with defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix (osteoid). However, bone's fracture resistance is due to toughening mechanisms at various hierarchical levels, ranging from the nano- to the microstructure. Thus, we hypothesize that the increase in fracture risk with vitamin D deficiency may be triggered by numerous pathological changes and may not solely derive from the absence of mineralized bone.

We found that the characteristic increase in osteoid-covered surfaces in vitamin D-deficient bone hampers the remodeling of the remaining mineralized bone tissue. Using spatially resolved synchrotron bone mineral density distribution analyses and spectroscopic techniques, we observed that the bone tissue within the osteoid frame has a higher mineral content with mature collagen and mineral constituents, characteristic of aged tissue. In situ fracture mechanics measurements and synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography of the crack path indicated that vitamin D deficiency increases both the initiation and propagation of cracks by 22 to 31%. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is not simply associated with diminished bone mass. Our analyses reveal the aged nature of the remaining mineralized bone and its greatly decreased fracture resistance. Through a combination of characterization techniques spanning multiple size scales, our study expands clinical understanding of the pathophysiology.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^114QNBg8]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

In the absence of sufficient UV-B exposure and dietary intake, 25(OH)D levels depend heavily on the release of stored vitamin D built up during periods of high vitamin D availability, most from heightened UV-B exposure. It is well documented that vitamin D stores decline and 25(OH)D levels greatly decrease during the dark season. Winter and spring levels at higher latitudes, such as in Central and Northern Europe, Canada, and the northern half of the United States, commonly drop to half of the summer and autumn levels or less. People who are elderly, obese, have dark skin tones, or carry genetic risk variants tend to be more severely affected than others living in the same region.

Deficient vitamin D status, as indicated by low 25(OH)D levels, undermines the maintenance of good health. There is little doubt that very low concentrations of 25(OH)D leave an opening for various health harms, from accelerated progression of osteoporosis, greater risk of falls, increased prevalence of obesity, heightened vulnerability to perinatal depression, impairment of glucose homeostasis, to reduced life expectancy and increased overall mortality, not least due to respiratory diseases. Thus, even if it turns out that a permissive effect of vitamin D deficiency for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the health outcomes following from that infection does not exist, there is still broad consensus that nobody should be vitamin D deficient at any time, neither in winter nor in old age, neither due to obesity nor due.

- **Population**: This recommendation pertains to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and who are not known to exhibit signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults (I statement).

### Vitamin D-resistant diseases [^114K13xo]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Hereditary vitamin D receptor defects (HVDRDs) is a more appropriate and precise title for an inborn error of metabolism commonly known as pseudo-vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D dependency, type II. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder; approximately 70 kindreds have been described. Its main importance lies in elucidating the physiology of vitamin D and calcium homeostasis in humans. Patients usually develop clinical and biochemical aberrations, identical to vitamin D deficiency but with high serum levels of calcitriol, within the first year of life, including muscle weakness, bone pain, deformities, and fractures. Defective calcium gut absorption leads to hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, and defective mineralization of newly formed bone matrix. The disease is not cured by vitamin D replacement therapy, although some patients respond to very high doses of vitamin D or its metabolites.

Cells derived from patients, mainly cultured skin fibroblasts, have been used to assess steps in calcitriol action, from cellular uptake to bioresponse, and to elucidate the molecular aberrations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Point mutations in the VDR gene were identified in every patient examined, and the same defect was observed in the obligatory heterozygotes. The functional characterization of the patient's VDR reflected the localization of the mutation, with 18 different mutations described at the time of writing. This provides vital information about the structure-function relationship in the human VDR and the essentiality of the VDR as the mediator of vitamin D action.

### Low vitamin D status despite abundant sun exposure [^115m2dmi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Lack of sun exposure is widely accepted as the primary cause of epidemic low vitamin D status worldwide. However, some individuals with seemingly adequate UV exposure have been reported to have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, results that might have been confounded by imprecision of the assays used.

- **Objective**: The aim was to document the 25(OH)D status of healthy individuals with habitually high sun exposure.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted in a convenience sample of adults in Honolulu, Hawaii (latitude 21 degrees).

- **Participants**: The study population consisted of 93 adults (30 women and 63 men) with a mean (SEM) age and body mass index of 24.0 years (0.7) and 23.6 kg/m² (0.4), respectively. Their self-reported sun exposure was 28.9 (1.5) hours/week, yielding a calculated sun exposure index of 11.1 (0.7).

- **Main outcome measures**: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured using a precise HPLC assay. Low vitamin D status was defined as a circulating 25(OH)D concentration less than 30 ng/ml.

- **Results**: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 31.6 ng/ml. Using a cutoff point of 30 ng/ml, 51% of this population had low vitamin D status. The highest 25(OH)D concentration was 62 ng/ml.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that variable responsiveness to UVB radiation is evident among individuals, causing some to have low vitamin D status despite abundant sun exposure. In addition, because the maximal 25(OH)D concentration produced by natural UV exposure appears to be approximately 60 ng/ml, it seems prudent to use this value as an upper limit when prescribing vitamin D supplementation.

### Controversies in vitamin D: Summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that, along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies having been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed:

- **Vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D**
- **Skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D**
- **Therapeutics of vitamin D**:

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference. Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge…

### Hyperparathyroidism and malnutrition with severe vitamin D deficiency [^112gUCgY]. World journal of surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency and its associated problems are common in developing Asian countries and countries of the Middle East. Various factors, including poor nutritional status and other compounding factors such as dietary, cultural, ethnic, and environmental factors, play a major role in contributing to poor calcium and vitamin D homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to exacerbate signs and symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). In this overview, we present evidence of the impact of vitamin D and calcium deficiency on primary HPT (PHPT).

- **Methods**: We performed an evidence-based review of articles published in the English language between January 1960 and June 2008.

- **Results**: Level IV evidence suggests widespread calcium and vitamin D deficiency in developing countries (issue 1). Limited level IV evidence suggests malnutrition as a primary cause of calcium and vitamin D deficiency (issue 2). Level IV evidence suggests that calcium and vitamin deficiencies cause secondary HPT and possibly PHPT as well (issues 3 and 4). A literature search revealed only six studies that correlated vitamin D levels with clinical, biochemical, and pathologic features of PHPT (issue 5). These studies provide level IV evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency causes some specific clinical features of PHPT as well as exacerbating other features of the disease.

- **Conclusions**: In the developing countries, which have severe vitamin D and calcium deficient population, PHPT patients present with advanced disease and particularly severe bone symptoms. There is presently only level IV evidence to support these findings.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^111TBfK7]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin D levels is expressed in either ng/ml or nmol/l, where 1 ng/ml is equivalent to 2.5 nmol/l. However, several technical challenges should be recognized when measuring these levels.

- **Types of assays**: There are two main types of assays used for measuring 25OHD: the immune-based assay, which is commonly used in clinical practice, and the chromatography-based assay, which is considered the gold standard for research. The use of different methods among laboratories leads to great variability in test results. This has prompted the recent introduction of the standard reference material for vitamin D by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.

- **Detection issues**: Total circulating 25OHD is the sum of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3. Not all immunoassays used in clinical practice can detect 25OHD2, which can result in an underestimation of 25OHD levels.

- **Potential confounders**: Other vitamin D metabolites, which are relatively abundant, may be present and falsely elevate 25OHD levels, accounting for 2 to 20% of the 25OHD measured.

### Magnesium deficit: Overlooked cause of low vitamin D status [^115yxhMs]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Like vitamin D deficit, magnesium deficit is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several steps in vitamin D metabolism, such as vitamin D binding to its transport protein and the conversion of vitamin D into the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by hepatic and renal hydroxylation, depend on magnesium as a cofactor. A new analysis of two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets, published in BMC Medicine, investigated potential interactions between magnesium intake, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D — which is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status — and mortality. Data indicate a reduced risk of insufficient/deficient vitamin D status at high magnesium intake and an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with magnesium intake above the median.

This study provides important findings concerning potential metabolic interactions between magnesium and vitamin D and its clinical relevance. However, results should be considered preliminary since biochemical data on individual magnesium status were lacking; confounding cannot be excluded, and questions on the dose-response relationship still remain to be answered.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency include symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency.

Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng/mL (50 to 75 nmol/L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes.

To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^116754JX]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

As the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly expanding, we need to proactively explore plausible options to slow its seemingly inexorable progress and be better prepared for new waves of epidemic severe respiratory infections. We would be amiss if we did not look earnestly for low-risk nutritional interventions that can be deployed to the entire public. Correcting deficient vitamin D status may be a good target for such an intervention because the possibly seasonal outbreaks of COVID-19 and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic could point in this direction.

Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common during winter and spring in regions located at higher latitudes, which may be defined as places at a latitude greater than 40° and includes the UK, Central and Northern Europe, Canada, and the northern half of the United States. Similarly, some regions in the southern hemisphere are affected. This short communication will explore key factors that increase the likelihood of individuals having low vitamin D status during winter and spring, a permissive factor for viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, including COVID-19.

To make it clear at the outset, this presentation concerns only measures that ensure adequate vitamin D status within currently accepted guidelines and is not suggesting the use of very high oral doses that exceed currently set upper limits.

The consideration of factors that make it more likely for an individual to have vitamin D deficiency is an important example of the practical application of precision nutrition (PN).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status. Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

- **Overview of vitamin D metabolism**: The figure shows the metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level: for whom and for what. It is crucial to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1167Q1RY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin D metabolism and mechanism of action:

- **Metabolism**: Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D2 and D3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D3, 23) hydroxy forms: 24,25(OH)2D2/3, 23,25(OH)2D3, and 1,24,25(OH)3D2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH)3D3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH)2D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### An evidence-based review of vitamin D for common and high-mortality conditions [^114YxCHb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin available from food and sun exposure. Vitamin D receptors are present in cells throughout the body, causing it to act like a hormone. Observational studies document the association of low vitamin D levels with multiple health conditions. This article reviews the evidence for vitamin D in prevention and treatment in primary care.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature review of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large prospective trials looking at the role of vitamin D deficiency in the most common conditions seen in primary care and the top 10 causes of mortality since 2010.

- **Results**: Vitamin D supplementation in patients with known cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack. It does not seem to have an effect in the treatment of hypertension or in cancer prevention. There is emerging evidence that supplementation reduces COVID-19 severity and risk of mechanical ventilation. Vitamin D at more moderate levels may reduce the risk of falls, but higher doses may cause an increased fall risk. There does not seem to be a link between vitamin D supplementation and improved cognition. Vitamin D supplementation may be helpful in patients with major depression. High dose vitamin D may improve pain in people with fibromyalgia. Supplementing patients with prediabetes reduced the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation, in addition to standard emollient treatment, helped to reduce symptoms in people with atopic dermatitis.

### Does low vitamin D status contribute to "age-related" morbidity [^111AicAy]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

It is increasingly appreciated that vitamin D plays important physiological roles beyond the musculoskeletal system. As such, it is plausible that endemic vitamin D deficiency contributes to much nonskeletal morbidity that adversely affects quality of life with advancing age among older adults. This overview will explore the evidence for and potential involvement of vitamin D deficiency in nonbone conditions that are currently accepted as "age-related" morbidity among older adults.

### Vitamin D: Importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis [^113qJMQH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to put into perspective the many health benefits of vitamin D and the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing the risk of many common and serious diseases, including some common cancers, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Numerous epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sunlight, which enhances the production of vitamin D(3) in the skin, is important in preventing many chronic diseases. Because very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, sunlight supplies most of our vitamin D requirement.

25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the metabolite that should be measured in the blood to determine vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in infants who are solely breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation, and in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities. Vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. A new dietary source of vitamin D is orange juice fortified with vitamin D. Studies in both human and animal models add strength to the hypothesis that the unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency worldwide is a contributing factor to many chronic, debilitating diseases.

Greater awareness of the insidious consequences of vitamin D deficiency is needed. Annual measurement of serum 25(OH)D is a reasonable approach to monitoring for vitamin D deficiency. The recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are inadequate, and, in the absence of exposure to sunlight, a minimum of 1000 IU of vitamin D per day is required.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111ByWWk]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Theoretically, obtaining a 25(OH)D level within an optimal window for the general population will necessarily result in overscreening and overtreatment of healthy individuals. While general screening for 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency is not recommended, measurements could be performed in patients with several risk factors for severe deficiency or who are being evaluated for metabolic bone disease. This recommendation may help to mitigate the dramatic increase in the number of 25(OH)D measurements and the associated economic burden. Supporting this view, initiatives have been undertaken to reduce unnecessary 25(OH)D analyses in Australia. The change in recommended testing criteria halved the number of measurements but paradoxically increased the number of unnecessary tests and decreased tests of patients at high risk of deficiency, with only a small improvement in the detection of deficiency.

- **Screening in the general population — public health approach**: Levels of 25(OH)D in the general population vary considerably depending on several factors, including the season, latitude, cultural factors leading to reduced UVB light exposure, skin pigmentation, body mass index (BMI), sex, age, level of physical exercise, and food fortification with vitamin D or use of vitamin D supplements, even among otherwise comparable Western societies. Moreover, genetic factors such as gene polymorphisms may have major effects on serum 25(OH)D according to twin studies and Mendelian randomization (MR) reports.

### Vitamin D deficiency is not associated with growth or the incidence of common morbidities among Tanzanian infants [^117WtLR4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

- **What is known**: Infants are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to limited sun exposure and low dietary intake via human breastmilk. Dark skin pigmentation is a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D deficiency can cause nutritional rickets. A previous cohort study conducted in Tanzania determined that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected infants with severe vitamin D deficiency at 6 weeks of age had an increased risk of wasting.

- **What is new**: Vitamin D deficiency is common, particularly during the early weeks of life among HIV-unexposed Tanzanian infants. Vitamin D status among Tanzanian infants is primarily determined by breastfeeding status and season. Poor vitamin D status does not appear to be an important contributor to morbidity and growth among HIV-unexposed Tanzanian infants.

Globally, it is estimated that 1 billion people are vitamin D deficient and nearly 50% of the global population is affected by vitamin D insufficiency. For most individuals, 50% to 90% of the body's vitamin D is produced by sun exposure of the skin, while the remaining proportion is obtained from the diet. As a result, the risk of vitamin D deficiency is highly influenced by sun exposure, latitude, skin-covering clothing, and skin pigmentation. Infants are known to be at particularly high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to low rates of sun exposure and low dietary intake via human breastmilk, particularly if the mother is vitamin D deficient.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^116Bce1P]. Clinical ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

When vitamin D deficiency is suspected, the serum 25(OH)D3 level is measured, as it is the major circulating form of vitamin D. Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 is not often measured except in special cases, such as acquired and inherited vitamin D disorders. A serum 25(OH)D3 level lower than 20 ng/mL (500 mmol/liter) is considered vitamin D deficient, while levels between 21 and 29 ng/mL (525–725 mmol/liter) are considered vitamin D insufficient.

In Canada and the United States, foods such as cow's milk and margarine are fortified with vitamin D. However, this may not suffice in areas with low levels of sun exposure. It is recommended that infants receive a daily 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D, while adults should obtain 400–2000 IU daily.

### Vitamin D supplementation: Guidelines and evidence for subclinical deficiency [^116p1oAq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To summarize recommendations from the 2011 US Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D and the new guideline from the US Endocrine Society, we focus on treating and preventing vitamin D deficiency. This includes considerations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those who have undergone gastric bypass.

- **Recent findings**: The US Institute of Medicine's Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D is 400 IU per day for children younger than 1 year, 600 IU per day for children aged 1 year and adults up to 70 years, and 800 IU per day for older adults. The Institute concluded that a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/ml or more will satisfy the requirements of 97.5% of the population. Meanwhile, the US Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline suggests that 400–1000 IU per day may be needed for children aged less than 1 year, 600–1000 IU per day for children aged 1 year or more, and 1500–2000 IU per day for adults aged 19 years or more to maintain 25(OH)D levels above the optimal level of 30 ng/ml. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, even in a quiescent state, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery may malabsorb vitamin D and thus require higher dosages to maintain adequate vitamin D status.

The differences in recommendations between the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's Practice Guideline reflect varying goals and perspectives on evidence. Significant gaps remain in the literature, and further studies on vitamin D treatment to assess changes in outcomes at different 25(OH)D levels are needed.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115rP1Fz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for vitamin D deficiency, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of higher doses (2–3 times higher; at least 6,000–10,000 IU/day) of vitamin D. This should be followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000–6,000 IU/day in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or those on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism. The goal is to treat vitamin D deficiency and maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level greater than 30 ng/mL.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^11271EhQ]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

- **Key modulators of vitamin D status**: Dietary intake of the most common natural form of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in most, if not all, people. The rare exceptions are usually due to acquired or inherited disruptions of vitamin D absorption and metabolism, such as severe cholestasis and abetalipoproteinaemia. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), now a less common form in dietary supplements, has lower bioavailability and potency than vitamin D3 but has been used extensively in the past due to the low cost associated with its production.

- **Dietary sources**: Only a few foods, mainly fatty coldwater fish like herring, sardines, mackerel, and salmon, contain naturally significant amounts of vitamin D. Some foods, such as milk in the United States and fortified cereals in many countries, contain artificially added vitamin D, typically as vitamin D3. Another important vitamin D source for some people is dietary supplements.

After vitamin D is absorbed from the small intestines and bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in circulating blood, it eventually reaches the liver and is then rapidly converted by cytochrome enzymes, mainly CYP2R1, to the 25(OH)D form found in circulating blood. Higher vitamin D intake then tends to be associated with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. Representative oral doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU supplemental vitamin D3, in addition to approximately 200 IU from foods, were seen after three years to increase initially adequate 25(OH)D levels by about 0%, 63%, and 78%, respectively.

### Vitamin D deficiency is endemic in neurosurgical patients and is associated with a longer length of inpatient stay [^114uTrcj]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in spinal surgery and critical care. Hypovitaminosis D may impact outcomes in cranial neurosurgical care and play roles in underlying disease processes.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational cohort study was performed. All emergency cranial neurosurgical ward admissions from January 1 to May 10, 2017, were screened for inclusion (n = 406). Patients already receiving vitamin D supplementation, spinal patients, and elective admissions were excluded. Admission vitamin D levels were checked for all remaining patients (n = 95). Patients with vitamin D < 30 nmol/L were defined as "deficient" and those 30–50 nmol/L as "inadequate". All patients with levels < 50 nmol/L were provided supplementation, as per local guidelines. Descriptive analyses of the cohorts were undertaken, with multivariate regression used to assess the effect of vitamin D on length of stay, inpatient morbidity, and mortality.

- **Results**: The median age of participants was 61 years (n = 95; 57% male, 43% female). The median vitamin D level was 23 nmol/L, classified as deficient. A total of 84% (n = 80) of patients had low vitamin D levels, with 61% (n = 58) classified as deficient (< 30 nmol/L). Vitamin D deficiency rates were comparable for those aged below 65 years (86%; n = 38/44) and those above 65 years (82%; n = 42/51). A deficient vitamin D level was associated with a longer hospital stay (P = 0.03), and this relationship persisted after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, and preadmission Charlson co-morbidity index. No statistically significant association was seen between vitamin D status and inpatient morbidity and mortality.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1143e3eh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly in neonatal and pediatric patients, the 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring a vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day for infants and children aged 0–1 year, and at least 600 IU/day for children aged 1 year and older, to maximize bone health. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 400 IU/day and 600 IU/day for 0–1 year olds and 1–18 year olds, respectively, are adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. However, it is recognized that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to > 30 ng/mL.

### Prevalence and risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency at birth and associated outcome [^116qij2h]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

We found that up to 45% of infants are at risk for deficient and 35% for insufficient levels of vitamin D. The approximated probability of an infant being born with a sufficient vitamin D level, as defined by the AAP for children, is less than 40%. Importantly, the upper limit of vitamin D that is defined as sufficient could be suboptimal because vitamin D levels of < 30 ng/mL have been associated with increased secretion of intact parathyroid hormone and reduced intestinal calcium absorption in healthy adults. While a vitamin D level of 20 ng/mL is considered sufficient, maintenance of 30 ng/mL is recommended for better health in children and adults despite the lack of clear evidence of an optimal concentration of vitamin D for bone and general health. Because the main source of vitamin D is vitamin D3, which is synthesized in the skin through a photolytic reaction, the level of vitamin D depends on skin pigmentation, use of sunscreens, coverage of sun-exposed skin, seasonal factors, and geographic latitude.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 20 ng/mL.

- **Symptoms and impact**: Signs of vitamin D deficiency can include bone pain and muscle weakness. This condition can lead to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children.

- **Risk groups**: Populations at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency include individuals with limited sun exposure (e.g. living north or south of 33° latitude), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity.

### Is vitamin D the fountain of youth [^1121WqZ8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

The objective is to review the role of vitamin D deficiency for both classic and "nonclassic" effects and raise the caution that association does not prove causation.

Methods used involved reviewing pertinent literature regarding vitamin D and its effects on bone, muscle function, immune function, glucose tolerance, cancer risk, and the development of cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Additionally, the limitations of observational studies are discussed.

Results indicate that vitamin D inadequacy is common worldwide and classically causes osteomalacia and rickets. More recently, the contribution of low vitamin D status to increased falls and fracture risk has become appreciated. Nonclassic effects of vitamin D inadequacy are also being recognized, such as its potential association with a multitude of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, and hypertension, as well as higher overall mortality. It is crucial to recognize that associations in observational studies might be due to chance, bias, or confounders, or they may indicate causality.

Conclusion emphasizes that, because vitamin D deficiency has been established to have adverse musculoskeletal consequences, optimization of vitamin D status — both for the individual patient and the overall population — is indicated.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D — implications for clinicians [^113imBRF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify the risk. We present our perspective and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by approximately 10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes that cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data becomes available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit healthcare providers and patients alike.
