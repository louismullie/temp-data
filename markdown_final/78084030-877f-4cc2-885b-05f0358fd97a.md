## Question

What is the management protocol for an elevated renin level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management protocol for an elevated plasma renin level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the laboratory result and eliminating pre‑analytical and medication confounders. Then, I should determine whether the renin elevation is physiological versus pathological by assessing volume, sodium, and potassium status. Next, I'll construct a differential diagnosis emphasizing renovascular disease, heart failure, CKD, and reninoma, followed by targeted diagnostics, including imaging and, if needed, renal‑vein sampling. Finally, I'll outline therapy tailored to etiology, highlight pregnancy considerations, and specify monitoring and follow‑up with actionable targets and safety checks [^1121C5kQ] [^112WYv6D] [^115GAyMZ].

> Let me first confirm the laboratory validity because erroneous handling can artifactually elevate renin; I need to ensure blood is drawn and kept at room temperature, promptly separated within about 30 minutes, and not cooled to avoid cryoactivation of prorenin to renin, with repeat testing if the result conflicts with the clinical picture, and I should clarify whether the lab used plasma renin activity versus direct renin concentration since conversion factors are unreliable and local reference intervals must be used, and to be safe I'll restate that point even if it seems obvious because assay context drives interpretation [^1121C5kQ] [^111hrmSu] [^111zompz].

> Wait, let me verify posture, timing, potassium, sodium intake, and interfering drugs because these can shift renin substantially; guidelines advise morning sampling after the patient has been ambulatory, with seated rest before the draw, correction of hypokalemia, liberalized sodium intake, and withdrawal of RAAS‑active agents when clinically feasible, typically four weeks for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and about two weeks for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and if the initial screen is negative despite strong suspicion, I should repeat under standardized conditions rather than jumping to conclusions [^115guxTh] [^112WYv6D] [^115E2NtR].

> Hold on, I should review non‑laboratory physiology next; hypovolemia, low sodium intake, and diuretic use can physiologically drive renin upward, so I need to replete volume and sodium and re‑assess after pausing modulating drugs when safe, and in parallel I should check for concomitant factors that affect risk and monitoring such as concurrent trimethoprim, NSAIDs, or beta‑blockers, while planning follow‑up labs 10–14 days after any RAAS drug initiation or titration to ensure safe creatinine and potassium trajectories [^115GAyMZ] [^111r5wu5] [^115QXn5h].

> I need to ensure the interpretation is framed correctly; if renin remains elevated despite appropriate posture, potassium correction, liberal sodium, euvolemia, and medication washout, that pattern points toward a pathologic source such as renovascular disease or a renin‑secreting tumor rather than a transient physiologic adaptation, so I should escalate the etiologic work‑up at that point [^115GAyMZ] [^115eVkLK].

> Next, I should review common secondary drivers of hyper‑reninemia before chasing rare entities; renovascular hypertension, malignant hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, major volume losses, and critical illness can all raise renin, so clinical exam, basic labs, and targeted testing for these conditions should precede tumor work‑up to avoid premature anchoring [^115GAyMZ].

> But wait, what if the clinical phenotype is striking for reninoma; severe or malignant hypertension, often with hypokalemia, in a younger patient — classically women around their 20s to 30s — with non‑suppressed renin and secondary hyperaldosteronism should prompt focused tumor evaluation because reninoma is rare but surgically curable and too often missed when RAAS blockers blunt the biochemical signal, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in that scenario [^115eVkLK] [^112B4Bdn].

> I will now examine the imaging pathway; dedicated thin‑slice arterial‑phase renal CT or MRI is the first step to identify the typical small, subcapsular, hypovascular juxtaglomerular cell tumor, and if imaging is indeterminate, selective renal‑vein sampling for renin lateralization can confirm a unilateral source; I should also note that PRA and DRC can occasionally diverge, so if one appears discordant, measuring the other may help reconcile the physiology before proceeding invasively [^115eVkLK] [^111Gbmvn].

> Let me consider biochemical confirmation carefully; reninoma produces a pattern of elevated aldosterone with non‑suppressed renin and thus a relatively low aldosterone‑to‑renin ratio, the mirror image of primary aldosteronism, and while I initially thought a saline infusion test primarily belongs to PA confirmation, it can still demonstrate failure to suppress aldosterone in renin‑driven states, although in practice, imaging plus renal‑vein renin gradients often provides more direct localization for surgery, so I should tailor testing to the pretest probability and imaging results [^notfound] [^115eVkLK].

> For definitive reninoma, I should confirm that nephron‑sparing partial nephrectomy is the preferred therapy because it is curative with normalization of RAAS and elimination of malignant hypertension and hypokalemia in most cases, and I need to remember that medical blockade is effective but suboptimal in women of child‑bearing age given teratogenicity of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and contraindications to MRAs in pregnancy, so surgery is particularly compelling in that group [^115eVkLK].

> If renovascular hypertension is identified, I should confirm revascularization candidacy and, when anatomically suitable, consider angioplasty with or without stenting; if revascularization is not feasible or as adjunctive care, I should initiate ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy while monitoring for a creatinine rise exceeding roughly 30 percent, which may signal hemodynamic compromise in bilateral disease or solitary kidneys, and carefully titrate additional agents as needed [^115GAyMZ].

> In HFrEF phenotypes with high renin due to low renal perfusion, I should verify GDMT with ARNI as preferred over ACEi/ARB when tolerated and add evidence‑based beta‑blockade because beta‑blockers blunt the reactive renin surge and may potentiate RAAS inhibition benefits, though I need to reassess renal function and potassium after each change to ensure safety [^117XnBu6] [^1142oixc].

> For CKD with albuminuria and hypertension, I should initiate and uptitrate ACE inhibitor or ARB to the maximally tolerated dose per KDIGO and ADA guidance, anticipating small to moderate creatinine increases and watching potassium closely 7–14 days after initiation or dose changes, with ongoing 3–6 month surveillance once stable, and I should avoid dual RAAS blockade given lack of long‑term benefit and higher adverse event rates [^115YuZ9N] [^112GvUmE] [^117HpBwC] [^115QXn5h].

> Let me reconsider patients with renin‑driven hypertension but no discrete tumor; high renin predicts response to RAAS blockade, so ACE inhibitor or ARB is first‑line, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled, I should add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and consider titrating to achieve unsuppressed renin, as emerging evidence and guidelines suggest that moving renin from suppressed to unsuppressed correlates with improved outcomes, with a pragmatic dose‑planning heuristic of roughly 25 mg plus five times baseline aldosterone in ng/dL of spironolactone equivalents while ensuring tight potassium monitoring to mitigate hyperkalemia risk [^115KkoM8] [^115JVAvN] [^116zSMdP].

> For pregnancy or planned pregnancy, I should confirm that ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and MRAs are avoided, use labetalol or nifedipine for blood pressure control, and prioritize surgical resection for reninoma when feasible to remove the pathological driver without exposing the fetus to teratogenic agents [^115eVkLK].

> Next, I should review an ongoing surveillance framework; I will target clinic and home blood pressure control to contemporary thresholds, recheck creatinine and potassium 7–14 days after starting or modifying ACEi/ARB/MRA and then every 3–6 months, remeasure renin and aldosterone about 2–4 weeks after therapy changes to confirm the intended suppression or unsuppression pattern and then every 6–12 months, and obtain post‑resection renal imaging at about one year to exclude recurrence, adjusting frequency thereafter to the clinical trajectory [^115QXn5h] [^115KkoM8] [^115eVkLK].

> Hold on, I should verify ARR‑related nuances because many patients arrive after PA screening; posture, potassium, and medication effects shape the ARR, direct renin is replacing PRA in many labs, and population‑based cutoffs should be locally validated rather than converted mathematically, so if ARR remains unexpectedly high or low, I should repeat testing under standardized conditions or pivot to alternative etiologic pathways consistent with the clinical phenotype without over‑relying on a single threshold [^115guxTh] [^115E2NtR] [^111hrmSu].

> To summarize, I should double‑check assay integrity and pre‑analytical factors, exclude common systemic causes of hyper‑reninemia, pursue reninoma when the phenotype fits with targeted imaging plus, if needed, renal‑vein sampling, and deliver etiology‑specific therapy — surgery for reninoma, revascularization and RAAS blockade for renovascular disease, GDMT for HFrEF, and ACEi/ARB ± MRA for CKD and renin‑driven hypertension — with structured safety monitoring and biomarker‑guided follow‑up; if any step seems inconsistent with the evolving data on the patient, I will pause, repeat the critical measurements under standardized conditions, and realign the plan accordingly to avoid premature closure [^115eVkLK] [^115GAyMZ] [^117XnBu6] [^115YuZ9N] [^115KkoM8].

Elevated renin requires a structured approach: **confirm true elevation** by repeating renin/aldosterone [^115E2NtR] with corrected potassium, liberal sodium [^115guxTh], and after stopping interfering drugs (diuretics, ACEi/ARB, beta-blockers) for 2–4 weeks if safe [^112WYv6D]. Next, **identify the cause** with history, exam, labs, and imaging [^115GAyMZ] to distinguish renovascular disease, reninoma [^112B4Bdn], secondary hyperaldosteronism, or medication effects. Management is cause-specific: revascularize renovascular disease, resect reninoma [^115eVkLK], correct volume/sodium issues, and adjust medications; use RAAS blockers for hypertension/CKD/heart failure [^115YuZ9N] [^117XnBu6] with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^111r5wu5]. Monitor renin, aldosterone, potassium, and renal function regularly, and refer to endocrinology or nephrology for complex or refractory cases [^116PE1Kd].

---

## Step 1: confirm true elevation of renin

### Repeat testing under standardized conditions

- **Timing**: Morning [^115guxTh], after ≥ 2 hours ambulatory, seated 5–15 minutes before draw [^115E2NtR].
- **Diet**: Liberal sodium intake [^115guxTh]; avoid restriction.
- **Potassium**: Correct hypokalemia [^115guxTh] before testing [^112WYv6D].
- **Medications**: Stop aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing/wasting diuretics ≥ 4 weeks; ACEi/ARB, beta-blockers, centrally acting alpha-2 agonists ≥ 2 weeks if safe [^115guxTh] [^1155wk7z].
- **Sample handling**: Collect at room temperature; process promptly to avoid cryoactivation [^1121C5kQ] [^111zompz].

---

## Step 2: identify underlying causes

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a focused **history** covering hypertension, hypokalemia [^111KrBWa], volume status, medication use [^115GAyMZ], and family history, and a targeted **exam** assessing blood pressure and other signs of secondary hypertension [^116tMtLT], including volume status.

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Aldosterone**: Measure to assess secondary hyperaldosteronism [^115bXNhZ].
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, creatinine, eGFR [^115YuZ9N].
- **ARR**: Calculate to differentiate primary vs secondary aldosteronism [^1161K6m5].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Renal arteries**: Duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography for stenosis [^115GAyMZ].
- **Reninoma**: Renal MRI or CT for juxtaglomerular cell tumor [^115eVkLK].
- **Adrenals**: CT/MRI if secondary hyperaldosteronism suspected.

---

## Step 3: management based on underlying cause

### Renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis)

In renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis), **revascularization** with angioplasty ± stenting is appropriate for significant stenosis [^115GAyMZ], while **medical therapy** with ACEi/ARB [^115YuZ9N] requires close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^111r5wu5].

---

### Reninoma (juxtaglomerular cell tumor)

For reninoma (juxtaglomerular cell tumor), **surgery** with partial nephrectomy or tumor excision is curative [^115eVkLK]; **medical therapy** with ACEi/ARB or beta-blockers is used if surgery is delayed or contraindicated [^112B4Bdn].

---

### Secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome)

In secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), address the **underlying cause** by optimizing management of heart failure [^117XnBu6], cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, and use **RAAS blockade** with ACEi/ARB or MRAs [^116PE1Kd] with careful monitoring [^115QXn5h].

---

### Medication-induced elevated renin

For medication-induced elevated renin, make **adjustments** by modifying or discontinuing offending agents when feasible, and choose **alternatives** with less impact on renin when possible [^115GAyMZ] [^1142oixc].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **reassessment of renin and aldosterone** after interventions [^116PE1Kd] and regular monitoring of potassium and creatinine [^115QXn5h]. Track **blood pressure**, adjust therapy to targets [^111r5wu5], and repeat imaging as needed to confirm resolution.

---

## Referral to specialists

Referral to specialists should be guided by the underlying pathology. **Endocrinology** is appropriate for suspected reninoma, secondary hyperaldosteronism, or complex endocrine disorders [^115eVkLK]; **nephrology** for renovascular hypertension, CKD, or complex renal disease [^115YuZ9N]; and **cardiology** for heart failure or complex cardiovascular disease [^117XnBu6].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Patient education and lifestyle modifications should emphasize **moderating sodium intake** to avoid excessive renin stimulation [^115Ehyge] and ensuring strict adherence to medications and follow-up. Counseling should promote weight loss, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation.

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include pregnancy, in which **ACEi/ARB should be avoided** and beta-blockers or methyldopa considered. Pediatric patients require age- and growth-appropriate evaluation and management [^115guxTh]. In critical illness, renin may serve as a prognostic marker, while management focuses on the underlying condition [^115EFtZW].

---

## Step 8: documentation and communication

Maintain clear **records** of findings, interventions, and follow-up, and emphasize **teamwork** by communicating with the care team and specialists.

---

Elevated renin management requires confirming true elevation, identifying the cause, and applying targeted therapy with ongoing monitoring; **cause-specific treatment** and specialist input are essential for optimal outcomes [^115GAyMZ].

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^115eVkLK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

A reninoma is a functional tumor of afferent arteriolar juxtaglomerular cells that secretes the enzyme renin, leading to hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Reninoma is a potentially curable cause of pathological secondary hyperaldosteronism that results in often severe hypertension and hypokalemia. The lack of suppression of plasma renin contrasts sharply with the much more common primary aldosteronism, but diagnosis is often prompted by screening for that condition. The major differential diagnosis of reninoma is renovascular hypertension. Fewer than 200 cases of reninoma have been described. Reninomas have been reported across a broad demographic but have a 2:1 predilection for women, often of childbearing age. Aldosterone receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers offer effective medical management but are contraindicated in pregnancy, so surgical curative resection is ideal. The optimal imaging and biochemical workup of reninoma and management approach (ideally, tumor excision with subtotal renal resection) are described.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^112B4Bdn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Fewer than 200 cases of renin-producing tumors (reninomas or JGCTs) have been described since their discovery in 1967 by Robertson. The true prevalence is not known, and their presence may be masked by RAAS inhibitors or misdiagnosed as RVH. Reninomas have a tendency to occur in young women, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1 and a mean age of 27 years. They classically present with a triad of headache, hypertension, and hypokalemia. An unusual degree of resolution is seen with RAAS system blockade through either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockade. Hypertension is typically severe, with a median reported blood pressure of 201/130 mm Hg, and hypokalemia is present in more than 80% of cases.

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high-risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing the RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed medications, such as trimethoprim or β-blockers, both of which have been shown to increase serum potassium, and over-the-counter medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Additionally, assessing intravascular volume status is crucial. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery.

It is important to avoid starting or increasing the RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly, starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing the RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should continue to be assessed.

Among other possible causes, increased serum renin can be attributed to conditions such as:

- **Endocrine disorders**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, primary adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease
- **Cardiovascular issues**: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, renovascular hypertension, malignant hypertension, renal artery stenosis
- **Liver and kidney conditions**: Liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, minimal change disease
- **Other medical conditions**: Major bleeding, dehydration, low sodium intake, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, critical illness

Additionally, increased serum renin can be caused by medications such as:

- **Antihypertensives**: Propranolol ER, prazosin, methyldopa, atenolol, clonidine
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**: Indomethacin, indomethacin ER
- **Other medications**: Fludrocortisone, ketoconazole

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically relating to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity or renin mass/concentration as follows:

- **In the morning**: After the patient has been ambulatory (sitting, standing, or walking) for at least 2 hours.
- **Seated position before blood draw**: Patients should be seated for 5–15 minutes prior to the blood draw.
- **Correct and liberalize diet**: Ensure corrected hypokalemia and liberalized sodium intake.
- **Medication withdrawal**: Withdraw agents markedly affecting the results (aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing, and -wasting diuretics) at least 4–6 weeks before testing.
- **Repeat testing if needed**: Repeat testing 2 weeks after withdrawing medications likely to interfere with test accuracy (such as β-blockers, centrally acting α-2 agonists, ARBs, ACEis, directly acting renin inhibitors, and dihydropyridine CCBs) if the results are not diagnostic. Hypertension can be controlled with medications less likely to affect testing, such as slow-release verapamil, diltiazem, hydralazine, prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin.
- **Consider contraceptive use**: Recognize that false positive results might occur with direct renin mass/concentration if the patient is a female using oral contraceptives. Discontinue oral contraceptives for 1 month before testing if possible, or alternatively, measure plasma renin activity instead.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112WYv6D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the Endocrine Society 2025 guidelines recommend repeating the test on a different day if the initial screen is negative and factors like hypokalemia or medications could have resulted in a false-negative outcome. It is important to correct hypokalemia when present and withdraw interfering medications if safe and feasible. Discontinue mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors (such as amiloride and triamterene), and other diuretics for four weeks, as well as ACE inhibitors and ARBs for two weeks, since these medications can elevate renin or lower aldosterone levels.

For accurate potassium determination, measure plasma potassium in blood collected slowly with a syringe and needle, preferably not using a vacuum-sealed blood collection tube. Avoid fist clenching during collection, and wait at least five seconds after tourniquet release to insert the needle. Ensure separation of plasma from cells within 30 minutes of collection.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115bXNhZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 guidelines regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, particularly the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, recommend obtaining serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). The determination of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is advised to screen for primary aldosteronism in patients with hypertension.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111cLeL3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The ADA 2025 guidelines for medical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically concerning diabetic nephropathy management, recommend the initiation of either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have severely increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². These medications should be administered to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent progression of kidney disease and to reduce cardiovascular events.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111knoNE]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning the management of diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². These should be administered to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^115KkoM8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

While primary aldosteronism (PA) is often categorized as a discrete condition, recent evidence indicates that PA exists across a broad continuum of pathophysiology, thereby blurring the distinction between PA and low-renin hypertension (LRH). It is widely accepted that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can be used for the treatment of PA, particularly for patients with non-lateralizing PA, those who are not interested in surgery, or in settings where surgery may not be available or feasible. However, there are few published studies on the optimal approach of MRA therapy, and there is no consensus about biochemical treatment targets in MRA therapy of PA. Recent literature indicates that MRA therapy in PA is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but only when treatment results in a substantial rise in renin, from a suppressed to unsuppressed state. However, how to accomplish this in a safe and effective manner is not well understood.

We, therefore, conducted a retrospective study that evaluated an approach to the treatment of patients with LRH or probable PA using MRAs. This approach involves the gradual titration of MRAs, targeting unsuppressed renin. We hypothesized that this approach would be associated with a decrease in blood pressure and/or proteinuria in a safe manner.

Screening, diagnosis, and the spectrum of disease

Screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) relies on the simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma (direct) renin concentration or plasma renin activity, allowing for the calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR). In all but a handful of cases (e.g. young age with marked aldosteronism, hypertension, and hypokalemia, and complete renin suppression), a positive ARR screen is followed by confirmatory dynamic testing: (1) saline infusion test (SIT), (2) oral salt suppression test, (3) captopril challenge test, or (4) fludrocortisone suppression test.

Although this approach is generally advocated by specialists in the field, there remains considerable heterogeneity regarding the diagnostic thresholds employed for each of these tests. Furthermore, in recent years, an "expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism" has been acknowledged, suggesting that PA may not be readily diagnosed or distinguished based on rigid diagnostic cut-offs alone. For instance, Vaidya et al. describe a spectrum of disease ranging from clinically overt PA (patients with severe and/or resistant hypertension) readily detectable using thresholds for biochemical confirmation, to unrecognized yet biochemically overt PA (in patients with normotension or mild/moderate hypertension). These findings suggest the existence of "subclinical" or "nonclassical" categories of PA (normotensive patients with autonomous aldosterone secretion) who are likely to go unnoticed because they do not meet screening indications for PA.

### Renin and prorenin as biomarkers in hypertension [^113N1Cxq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

This review examines the evidence that plasma renin and/or prorenin levels may be used to guide therapy in hypertension and serve as an independent risk factor for future cardiovascular events.

Recent findings indicate that a large number of retrospective analyses of patient populations in clinical trials, where 'baseline' renin measurements were available, support that high renin levels, but not high prorenin levels, are indicative of future cardiovascular disease and death, particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction and/or hypertension. The relationship is not affected by the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. High renin levels also tend to support the use of RAS inhibitors as first-choice antihypertensive agents. However, the added value of a renin measurement on top of traditional risk factors is modest, and the pressure response to RAS blockade, even in high-renin patients, varies widely.

In summary, measuring 'baseline' renin as a marker of future cardiovascular events or to determine the choice of drug is of limited value in an individual patient.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115E2NtR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with patients seated and without dietary sodium restriction in the days leading up to screening. Obtaining potassium levels is necessary to accurately interpret aldosterone, as low potassium may result in a falsely low aldosterone reading.

Challenges in screening

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. Screening and diagnosis present principal challenges that limit effective management. There is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals in either primary or secondary care settings. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at risk" patients for PA. Screening, under these recommendations, should be conducted using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR), focusing on individuals with:

1. Severe hypertension
2. Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia
3. An adrenal mass
4. Sleep apnea
5. A family history of early-onset hypertension
6. Stroke at a young age
7. A first-degree relative who has PA

The American Heart Association guidelines for diagnosing and managing hypertension align with the Endocrine Society guidelines, recognizing risk factors that should trigger screening for PA. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines do not emphasize the need for screening for PA, except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (approximately 5% of all patients). Some national guidelines, such as those from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### Marked suppression of renin levels by beta-receptor blocker in patients treated with standard heart failure therapy: A potential mechanism of benefit from beta-blockade [^1142oixc]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recent trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in combination with standard heart failure medication. However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit are incompletely understood. It is hypothesized that beta-blockers may enhance the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or diuretics. This is achieved by preventing upregulation of renin that occurs in such patients.

Plasma renin levels were examined using a direct radioimmunometric assay in 312 men with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and echocardiographic LV dysfunction. Patients adhered to their physicians' prescriptions: antiplatelet agents alone (n = 62) or in combination with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or beta-blockers (n = 250).

Results showed that plasma renin levels were elevated in patients taking ACE inhibitors or diuretics and ACE inhibitors plus diuretics. Adjusted means from multiple regression analysis were 28.5 mU L-1 [95% CI = 20.6–39.5] and 73.7 mU L-1 [95% CI = 49.9–109.9], respectively, compared with patients on antiplatelet agents alone (16.1 mU L-1; 95% CI = 13.5–19.3, P < 0.05 each).

The combinations of beta-blockers with ACE inhibitors or diuretics and beta-blockers with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics resulted in markedly suppressed plasma renin levels. Adjusted means were 16.4 mU L-1 [13.1–20.6] and 32.1 mU L-1 [23.3–44.3], respectively, compared with respective patient groups without beta-blockers (P < 0.01 each).

Concomitant beta-blocker treatment can prevent the reactive renin stimulation observed in these patient groups, suggesting a potential mechanism for the benefit of beta-blockade in conjunction with standard heart failure therapies.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its therapeutic targets [^111Wsui5]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS, including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling, and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway, leading to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system. Moreover, dual inhibitors that block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or target upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines for medical management of chronic kidney disease, especially concerning RAAS inhibitors like ACEis/ARBs, recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A3) who do not have diabetes.

### Renin: friend or foe [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death more common than haemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved. The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step (beta blockade or direct renin inhibition), the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin. Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity. Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest of hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: The ultimate treatment for renal protection [^113g4qSq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.

However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of end-stage renal disease is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of blood pressure and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for the treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-renin hypertension [^115Rnv37]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Plasma renin levels can be used to classify hypertension. A significant proportion of hypertensive individuals display a low-renin profile, and thus, low-renin hypertension (LRH) requires appropriate diagnosis and treatment. LRH includes essential, secondary, and genetic forms, the most common of which are low-renin essential hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Several studies have investigated the relationship between plasma renin activity (PRA) status and clinical response to different antihypertensive therapies. This review discusses the differential diagnosis of LRH subtypes and the most appropriate treatment options based on the pathophysiological background of this condition.

### Evolving role of aldosterone blockers alone and in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in hypertension management: A review of mechanistic and clinical data [^113Rehrq]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an integral role in blood pressure regulation and has long been a target of pharmacologic approaches to controlling blood pressure. Traditionally, clinical interventions involving the RAAS have focused mainly on inhibiting the action of angiotensin II with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and limited attention has been devoted to direct inhibition of the action of aldosterone. Recent advances in understanding the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular injury have elevated the importance of direct inhibition of the action of this hormone in the long-term control of blood pressure and have led to the development of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone. This article reviews the role of the RAAS in the development of hypertension and discusses the rationale for the use of eplerenone with other medications affecting the RAAS to control blood pressure.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115QXn5h]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in the management of diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring for increased serum creatinine and increased serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used. Additionally, they advise monitoring for hypokalemia when diuretics are used. These checks should be performed during routine visits and again 7–14 days after initiation or after any dose change.

### Effects of ramipril on the aldosterone/renin ratio and the aldosterone/angiotensin II ratio in patients with primary aldosteronism [^1155wk7z]. Hypertension (2020).

The aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) is currently considered the most reliable approach for case detection of primary aldosteronism (PA). ACE (Angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are known to raise renin and lower aldosterone levels, thereby causing false-negative ARR results. Because ACE inhibitors lower angiotensin II levels, we hypothesized that the aldosterone/equilibrium angiotensin II (eqAngII) ratio (AA2R) would remain elevated in PA.
- **Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis**: This analysis involved 60 patients with PA and 40 patients without PA, revealing that the AA2R was not inferior to the ARR in screening for PA. When using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure plasma aldosterone concentration, the predicted optimal AA2R cutoff for PA screening was 8.3 (pmol/L)/(pmol/L).
- **Comparison of diagnostic performance**: We compared the diagnostic performance of the AA2R with the ARR among 25 patients with PA administered ramipril (5 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Compared with baseline, plasma levels of equilibrium angiotensin I (eqAngI) and direct renin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) after ramipril treatment, whereas eqAngII and ACE activity (eqAngII/eqAngI) decreased significantly (P < 0.01).

The changes in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration in the study were not significant. On day 14, four patients displayed false-negative results using ARR_direct renin concentration (plasma aldosterone concentration/direct renin concentration), three of whom also showed false-negative ARR_plasma renin activity (plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity).

### Management of hypertensive crises: The scientific basis for treatment decisions [^112tyNYF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The spectrum of disorders associated with elevated blood pressure (BP) encompasses chronic uncomplicated hypertension and the hypertensive crises, including hypertensive urgencies and emergencies. Although these syndromes vary widely in their presentations, clinical courses, and outcomes, they share pathophysiologic mechanisms and, consequently, therapeutic responses to specifically targeted antihypertensive drug types. Nevertheless, hypertensive crises are often treated with drugs that are either unsafe or of unsubstantiated efficacy in that setting.

This review examines the pathophysiology of commonly encountered hypertensive crises, including stroke, hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute pulmonary edema, and preeclampsia-eclampsia. It provides a rational approach to their treatment based on relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic principles. Measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) levels often provides insight regarding pathophysiology and predicts the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in individual patients. However, in hypertensive crises, drug therapy is initiated before the PRA level is known. The renin-angiotensin dependence (R-type) or volume dependence (V-type) of hypertension can often be deduced by the BP response to drugs that interrupt the renin system (R-drugs) or decrease body volume (V-drugs).

Based on these considerations, a treatment algorithm is provided to guide drug selection in patients presenting with a hypertensive crisis.

### Primary aldosteronism [^111KrBWa]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning indications for testing and hypertension, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend measuring plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin levels simultaneously in the initial case detection for PA. This approach recognizes that aldosterone elevation with suppressed renin levels identifies patients with potential PA.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^116E1sad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism, also termed primary reninism by Conn et al, may be detected in screens for secondary hypertension. It is characterized by an elevated plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) associated with an elevated plasma renin level, in contrast to the suppressed renin seen in the more common primary aldosteronism (PA).

Secondary hyperaldosteronism is triggered physiologically in hypovolemic states. Pathologically, hypertensive forms of secondary hyperaldosteronism are exemplified by renovascular hypertension (RVH) or reninoma. Other states mimicking mineralocorticoid excess are described in detail throughout the text.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^115tqwwM]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

It is important to note that the MRA dose needed to achieve unsuppressed renin in this series was reached carefully and in gradual 25–50 mg escalations. Based on the results of our study, we encourage clinicians to use our estimated final MRA dose of approximately 25 + 5×x, where x is the baseline aldosterone level (in ng/dl), as guidance instead of a dose specifically targeted or started with. It is essential to also note that hyperkalemia can happen at any time during dose escalation, even before renin is unsuppressed; therefore, clinicians should carefully monitor the patient's potassium after each escalation.

There is currently no consensus on the optimal approach to or the biochemical treatment targets for MRA therapy in patients with PA. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the medical therapy of PA, published in 2016, recommend MRA titration up to a fixed dose (100 mg of spironolactone) but do not specify targeting a particular renin level. Other studies have examined MRA treatment focused on the achieved absolute renin levels, the changes in renin levels, the baseline aldosterone-to-renin ratio, or the potassium levels. Importantly, multiple recent studies have shown that the residual cardiovascular risk in PA patients treated with MRA may be limited to individuals with persistently suppressed renin and that a substantial rise in renin may mitigate this excess risk. In the recent report that focused on targeting potassium levels, patients with PA only benefited from the intensification of MRA therapy if they had suppressed renin at baseline.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: Novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^114iQrsw]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Renin, catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the RAAS cascade, represents an attractive therapeutic target that was recently exploited by the introduction of the first-in-class selective renin inhibitor, aliskiren. Renin inhibition is associated with the attenuation of Ang I and Ang II levels and blood pressure (BP) reduction. Aliskiren reduced BP comparably to β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and AT1 receptor blockers. The possible benefit in renin inhibition might reside in the attenuation of plasma renin activity, which is increased by ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade. On the other hand, the high renin levels after aliskiren treatment might escape from renin inhibition, and aliskiren may not prevent the binding of renin to the (pro)renin receptor (P)RR. A large clinical study program, named Aspire Higher, is currently underway to determine whether aliskiren treatment ameliorates target-organ damage and positively affects cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality.

The far-from-optimal pharmacokinetic properties of aliskiren (2–7% bioavailability) and a ceiling dose of 300 mg daily (due to gastrointestinal irritation) invite novel agents in this class to the pipelines.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^113zFjLE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

In this retrospective observational study, we found that MRA therapy targeting unsuppressed renin levels in patients with LRH or probable PA was associated with substantial decreases in blood pressure and proteinuria, in the context of minimal adverse events that could be easily managed. Importantly, the effectiveness of this treatment approach was similar regardless of whether patients had a likely LRH phenotype (aldosterone 10 ng/dl), implying that empiric MRA therapy in patients with LRH could be an effective and pragmatic approach to achieve blood pressure control and potentially prevent complications in this underdiagnosed and undertreated condition.

The treatment strategy of targeting unsuppressed renin was highly effective in lowering blood pressure, with a mean decrease in SBP in excess of 20 mm Hg, despite the majority of patients discontinuing at least one baseline anti-hypertensive medication. This magnitude of blood pressure reduction compares favorably to what has been seen in most studies of other anti-hypertensive medications with baseline blood pressure at a similar level. Unlike some of the previously reported investigations, blood pressure reductions were similar between spironolactone and eplerenone, while eplerenone doses were approximately twice as high as spironolactone, consistent with their relative MR antagonist potency.

### Prenatally diagnosed unilateral hydronephrosis: prognostic significance of plasma renin activity [^111iuhMX]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy surrounds the optimal management of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis due to technical limitations in accurately quantifying the degree of obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction. These patients are regularly investigated for ureteropelvic junction obstruction, severe abdominal pain, abdominal lumps, and deterioration in renal function. In this descriptive study, we quantify plasma renin activity as an additional measure to evaluate renal outcomes.

In 90 consecutive children with prenatally diagnosed unilateral hydronephrosis, an association was sought between changes in plasma renin activity, split renal function, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine. Patients with split renal function less than 35% at presentation were excluded from the study. The mean follow-up was 50.1 ± 15.9 months (range 24 to 87). Pyeloplasty was performed if patients became symptomatic or if split renal function decreased more than 10% during follow-up.

An increase in plasma renin activity and a decrease in split renal function and glomerular filtration rate were noted in patients being followed non-operatively (40 patients) and in those requiring pyeloplasty (50). However, these parameters were more pronounced in the operated group. In the latter group, plasma renin activity increased by 64.7% between initial (15.9 ng) and preoperative (26.2 ng) values, and it became normal postoperatively. In non-operatively followed patients, plasma renin activity continued to increase until the last follow-up.

Plasma renin activity progressively increased.

### Diagnostic approach to low-renin hypertension [^112hDuHt]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in maintaining water and electrolyte homeostasis, and its deregulation contributes to the development of arterial hypertension. Since the historical description of the "classical" RAAS, there has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of both essential and secondary hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients affected by arterial hypertension display low-renin levels, a definition largely arbitrary and dependent on the investigated population and the specific characteristics of the assay. Most often, low-renin levels express a physiological response to sodium-volume overload, but a significant number of secondary hereditary or acquired conditions also fall within this category.

In the context of suppressed renin status, the concomitant examination of plasma aldosterone levels — whether inappropriately elevated, within the normal range, or suppressed — and plasma potassium are essential to formulate a differential diagnosis. To distinguish between the different forms of low-renin hypertension is fundamentally important to address the patient with the proper clinical management, as each subtype requires specific and targeted therapy. This review discusses the differential diagnosis of the most common medical conditions manifesting with a clinical phenotype of low-renin hypertension, highlighting the novelties in the genetics of familial forms.

### Novel approach to establishing an aldosterone: renin ratio cutoff for primary aldosteronism [^111hrmSu]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Direct renin concentration is replacing plasma renin activity in many laboratories for the investigation of primary aldosteronism, which may have a significant impact on the resulting aldosterone: renin ratios. We sought to develop a population-based approach to establishing an aldosterone: renin ratio cutoff when transitioning between assays. A population-based study was performed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, involving 4301 individuals who received testing from January 2012 to November 2015. In 2014, direct renin concentration replaced plasma renin activity in routine testing. We described the prevalence of primary aldosteronism in our population before the change and, using the assumption of disease prevalence stability, determined the corresponding ratio cutoffs after the introduction of the new assay.

During the initial portion of the study (using plasma renin activity), 4.9% of those screened were classified as highly probable cases, whereas 10.4% were considered probable and 28.9% possible using locally validated cutoffs. Aldosterone: renin ratio cutoffs were then determined for the direct renin concentration assay.

- **Highly probable cases**: Corresponded to a cutoff of > 100 pmol L⁻¹ mIU⁻¹ L⁻¹ with hypokalemia.
- **Probable cases**: Corresponded to a cutoff of > 100 pmol L⁻¹ mIU⁻¹ L⁻¹.
- **Possible cases**: Corresponded to a cutoff of > 35 pmol L⁻¹ mIU⁻¹ L⁻¹.

In contrast, cutoffs derived using a conversion factor resulted in significantly higher cutoffs and the potential for missed cases. In conclusion, using large population data, historically consistent aldosterone: renin ratio cutoffs can be established.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: Early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^116tHnR5]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Renin-dependent aldosteronism and primary aldosteronism

Several cardiorenal diseases, such as heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), enhance aldosterone through renin-dependent aldosteronism (Figure 1). These diseases were classically managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), which suppress aldosterone over the short term. However, aldosterone often rebounds over the long term (greater than 6 months), a phenomenon known as aldosterone breakthrough.

In addition, the hyperaldosterone state in cardiorenal diseases is not solely related to excess aldosterone levels. It is mainly driven by increased aldosterone ligand-dependent activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). The MRs are activated and overexpressed, independent of aldosterone levels in cardiorenal diseases. Also, cortisol is another natural MR ligand, which may activate the MRs in pathological states (Figure 1). Therefore, even for individuals with renin-dependent aldosteronism, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy is essential. It mitigates the insufficient and short-lived control of aldosterone excess by ACEi/ARBs, blocks the over-activated receptor, shields it from both aldosterone and cortisol effects, and improves prognosis, as proved by pivotal clinical trials.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: Current understanding and future direction [^115Ewkok]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is common and affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to management of these individuals is unclear.

This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectrum of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. Crucially, it is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1114bPr4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically in relation to confirmatory testing, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend not requiring aldosterone suppression testing before initiating PA-specific therapy in certain situations:

- **Resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia**: Do not obtain aldosterone suppression testing in patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production. This is defined as plasma renin activity ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration ≤ 2 mU/L, and plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 15 ng/dL (≥ 416 pmol/L) via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay or ≥ 20 ng/dL (≥ 554 pmol/L) via immunoassay, due to the risk of false-negative results, which may exceed the risk of false-positive screening results.
- **Treatment without adrenal venous sampling and adrenalectomy**: Consider empirically treating patients unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling and adrenalectomy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists based on screening results, without aldosterone suppression testing. Recognize that aldosterone suppression testing may still provide value in some cases for further documenting the diagnosis.
- **Familial hyperaldosteronism**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing in patients from families with germline mutations associated with familial hyperaldosteronism. Obtain genetic screening for all first-degree relatives of patients with familial hyperaldosteronism and for patients with young-onset PA (< 20 years) to enable early diagnosis and treatment.
- **Lateralizing PA likelihood**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing if the likelihood of lateralizing PA is high.

### Biomarkers to guide medical therapy in primary aldosteronism [^116PE1Kd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an endocrinopathy characterized by dysregulated aldosterone production that occurs despite suppression of renin and angiotensin II and is non-suppressible by volume and sodium loading. The effectiveness of surgical adrenalectomy for patients with lateralizing PA is shown by the attenuation of excess aldosterone production, leading to blood pressure reduction, correction of hypokalemia, and increases in renin-biomarkers that collectively indicate a reversal of PA pathophysiology and restoration of normal physiology.

Even though the vast majority of patients with PA will ultimately be treated medically rather than surgically, there is a lack of guidance on how to optimize medical therapy and on key metrics of success. Herein, we review the evidence justifying approaches to medical management of PA and biomarkers that reflect endocrine principles of restoring normal physiology. We examine the arsenal of medical therapies, including dietary sodium restriction, steroidal and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors.

It is crucial that clinicians recognize that multimodal medical treatment for PA can be highly effective at reducing the risk for adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes when titrated with intention. The key biomarkers reflective of optimized medical therapy are unsurprisingly similar to the physiologic expectations following surgical adrenalectomy: control of blood pressure with the fewest number of antihypertensive agents.

### Mitigating risk of aldosterone in diabetic kidney disease [^115khecU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Until recent data from studies on sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists were presented, the standard of care in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) for almost 20 years has been the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) alongside glucose management. Although this approach improves renal and cardiovascular outcomes (such as the development of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and hospitalization for heart failure), up to 50% of individuals have been reported to reach the primary endpoint after four years in the treated group. However, these data come from a study completed almost 20 years ago.

Hyperkalemia was a problem in the RENAAL study with losartan as monotherapy. Indeed, 38% of individuals had elevated potassium levels (> 5.0 mmol/L) after six months compared with 23% in the placebo group. Elevated potassium was associated with an increased risk of adverse renal outcomes.

The insufficient effect on renal and cardiovascular outcomes is explained by incomplete RAS blockade. ACEi can be bypassed by angiotensin II formation from chymases, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade may be incomplete. This led to exploration of dual blockade with a combination of ACEi and ARBs. In DKD, dual blockade was able to reduce proteinuria compared with single-agent intervention but did not provide long-term renal benefits in the VA NEPHRON-D study, which was stopped for futility and side effects, including hyperkalemia. Addition of renin inhibition was also not effective long-term, as reported in the ALTITUDE study.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: Novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^11599yQN]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite recent and substantial advances in the treatment of hypertension, the majority of patients remain not optimally controlled. Hence, there is a need for innovative strategies to lower blood pressure (BP). The BP target values are fairly aggressive, often requiring the addition of a fourth or fifth agent. This situation can challenge even the most skilled physicians and reduce drug compliance in a large proportion of patients.

Any innovation in antihypertensive therapy is generally judged on: (i) the capability to improve BP control; (ii) effectiveness in treatment-resistant hypertension; and (iii) the potential for further risk reduction beyond BP control, by impacting associated functional, metabolic, and structural alterations. While this issue is highly debated, most perspectives emphasize tight BP control rather than a specific treatment.

Novel approaches to hypertension treatment include:

- **Drug-based strategies**: Targeting traditional neurohumoral pathways, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), or less-studied pathways like endothelin or renalase.
- **Unique approaches involving gene and vaccine therapies**.
- **Device-based therapies**: Such as baroreceptor sensitization or renal nerve ablation.

We provide an overview of various therapies in development and outline prospects for how and which of them might impact clinical care.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^1121C5kQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Reninoma causes secondary hyperaldosteronism in response to supraphysiologic renin levels and hyperactivation of the RAAS, with or without hypokalemia (see Fig. 2).

Correct sample handling is fundamental to the behavior of renin and assay measurement. Cooling of samples results in cryoactivation and in vitro conversion of prorenin to renin, which can result in significant false elevation of the renin levels as measured by both plasma renin activity (PRA) and PRC. It is therefore recommended that renin samples be collected at room temperature and processed as soon as possible. Where the result is discrepant from the clinical picture, the collection should be repeated.

Measurement of PRA may provide superior estimation of functional effect over PRC, but it is labor-intensive and technically demanding. The automated PRC immunoassay measures total renin and, while it correlates acceptably well with PRA in hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism, differences should be acknowledged.

### Maintenance of blood pressure by reactive increases in plasma renin activity during salt depletion and renin-angiotensin system inhibition [^112xwcys]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The commentary also draws attention to the relevance of data that support our hypotheses that a PRA level below 0.65 ng/ml/h does not lead to a vasoconstrictor effect and that the vasoconstrictor effect of a PRA level above 4.5 ng/ml/h is incompletely blocked by clinical doses of RAS inhibitors. Clinical trials are needed to address both issues. Nonetheless, these hypotheses can account for the observation that RAS inhibitors are less effective antihypertensive agents in patients with low PRA levels, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is higher in patients with preexisting CVD who develop high PRA levels during treatment with a RAS inhibitor.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning RAAS inhibitors such as ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD who have normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1). This is recommended for specific indications, such as the treatment of hypertension or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113KdWnS]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly in the management of diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have severely increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine) and/or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The guideline suggests using these medications at maximally tolerated doses to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^1154Adyo]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) reduces blood pressure and represents a key element in approaches to cardiovascular risk reduction. The classical simplified image of the RAAS has recently evolved into a complex network. The cascade begins with the renal release of renin, which cleaves liver-produced angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Renin can also bind to its (pro)renin receptor (P)RR, enhancing its cleavage activity and activating its inactive precursor, prorenin.

However, binding to (P)RR can elicit angiotensin-independent effects, such as the activation of promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF), protein-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and eventually mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This results in enhanced proteosynthesis, proliferation, and decreased apoptosis.

### Plasma renin and outcome in the community: Data from PREVEND [^116CA9U8]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease, but the prognostic effect of plasma renin in the community remains unclear.
- **Methods and results**: The relationship between plasma renin concentration and CV events was studied in 6,228 subjects enrolled in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease (PREVEND) study who were not using antihypertensive medication. Plasma renin concentration was measured using a direct automated immunochemiluminescent assay. The mean (± SD) age was 47 (± 12) years, with 49% of participants being male. The mean follow-up was 10.5 years. The median (Q1-Q3) plasma renin level was 17.6 (10.9–27.2) µIU/mL, and plasma aldosterone was 119 (93–153) ng/L. The primary outcome was a composite of fatal (n = 27) and non-fatal (n = 408) CV events. Adjusted for age and sex, each doubling of plasma renin was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04–1.43; P = 0.015). In a multivariable model, plasma renin showed a positive correlation with heart rate and male sex, and a negative correlation with blood pressure, urinary sodium, glucose, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) (adjusted R²: 0.167, P < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates associated with plasma renin, the HR for reaching the primary outcome was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.09–1.49, P = 0.002). Plasma renin was associated with CV events regardless of blood pressure, but in subjects using antihypertensive medication, this association was absent.
- **Conclusion**: Plasma renin concentration is associated with cardiovascular events in the community.

### Analysis of screening and confirmatory tests in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: Need for a standardized protocol [^116cir4h]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The upright serum aldosterone/upright plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) has been recommended as a screening tool for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.
- **Objective**: We reviewed the data collected from hypertensive patients in order to define retrospectively the cut-off values and evaluate the reliability of the ARR and of the saline infusion test in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.
- **Patients**: In 157 patients referred to our unit with a suspicion of primary aldosteronism, 61 of whom had confirmed primary aldosteronism (26 with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and 35 with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism), the supine and upright ARR, and the ARR after the administration of captopril and losartan were calculated, and the results of the saline infusion test were analysed.
- **Results**: Choosing 40 as the cut-off value, the upright ARR had 100% sensitivity and 84.4% specificity. The post-captopril and post-losartan ARR were slightly more specific but at the cost of a lower sensitivity. A cut-off value of 7 ng/dl for serum aldosterone at the end of the saline infusion in patients with an upright ARR of 40 gave 100% specificity and a positive predictive value. Furthermore, APA patients showed increased mean levels of the aldosterone/cortisol ratio after the saline infusion test.
- **Conclusion**: Our data reinforce the superiority of a standardized upright ARR as a screening test in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, identifying 40 as an ideal cut-off value. Saline infusion represents a useful test to confirm such a diagnosis, with a serum aldosterone level of 7 ng/dl as a satisfactory parameter.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1143zvR8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), the ES 2025 guidelines recommend repeating the test on a different day if the patient's initial screen is negative and the pretest probability of PA is moderate to high. This includes cases of hypokalemia and/or resistant hypertension, or if renin is suppressed with aldosterone levels of 5–10 ng/dL (138–277 pmol/L) by immunoassay.

### An individualized approach to the evaluation and management of primary aldosteronism [^117UrvkC]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

With the increased emphasis on personalized and individualized medicine, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Adrenal Scientific Committee has developed a series of articles to update members on personalized medicine as it applies to adrenal diseases.
- **Methods**: We synthesized literature reviews, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience.
- **Results**: Since Conn described primary aldosteronism (PA) over 60 years ago, debate has raged about the prevalence of PA in the hypertensive population, the wisdom of broadly screening for PA, and prudent approaches to evaluate and manage these patients. Accumulated data from multiple centers around the globe have begun to crystallize the clinical characteristics about these patients, which allows for an individualized approach before the diagnosis of PA is even established. Evidence-based criteria for screening, improved and widely available clinical assays, and validated algorithms for evaluation empower all endocrinologists to address this complex disease in an effective manner.
- **Conclusion**: Breakthroughs in the pathogenesis and evolution of PA illustrate why our thinking about this disease must remain flexible: PA is not a rare and uniform condition, but rather a common syndrome with protean manifestations.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116tMtLT]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically in the evaluation for primary hyperaldosteronism, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining renin and aldosterone measurements. These measurements should be used to screen for primary aldosteronism in all adult patients with confirmed hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg).

### The clinical impact of sample storage at -20 °C on renin reference intervals and aldosterone-renin ratio calculations [^111zompz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To ensure reliable and clinically relevant renin levels and aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) for screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA), it is recommended that studies on renin and ARR measurements provide detailed information regarding sample collection and storage conditions, such as temperature and duration. By taking appropriate precautions to prevent cryoactivation through correct sample handling and storage, it is expected that intraindividual and interindividual variations in renin measurements will be reduced, leading to enhanced reliability and clinical utility of the ARR in PA diagnosis.

Moreover, even when samples for renin measurements are stored at −80 °C, the reference intervals (RI) used by laboratories may be determined based on experiments with inappropriate preanalytical storage conditions. To investigate how RI studies have been executed since 2016, we conducted a search in PubMed for studies defining renin RIs, focusing on those studies' sample collection, transport, and storage conditions. We identified nine studies defining RIs in different age groups for renin concentration or activity.

- **Study conditions**: Most of the studies utilized room temperature during sample handling and centrifugation. Only four studies mentioned the temperature at which the samples were stored before analyses, and none of the studies provided information regarding the conditions of sample transport.

- **Lack of information**: Three studies did not give any information about sample preparation, transport, and storage conditions.

- **Storage specifics**: Only two of the nine studies stored plasma samples in −80 °C freezers; in one study, the samples were handled for eight hours under unspecified conditions.

### Interpretation of steroid biomarkers in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and their use in disease management [^113LybTU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Historically, prior to neonatal screening, patients with classic 21OHD were categorized as having either "salt-wasting" or "simple virilizing" disease, alluding to the residual aldosterone production. Clinically, this distinction was based on whether spontaneous salt-wasting crises occurred prior to adequate treatment. However, all children with classic 21OHD waste variable sodium with illness. Aldosterone measurements were historically of little utility because the newborn kidney is very resistant to mineralocorticoid action, circulating aldosterone is generally quite high though variable in healthy neonates, high 17OHP antagonizes aldosterone action, and cross-reactivity with other steroids in aldosterone immunoassays clouded interpretation.

For these reasons, indirect measures of mineralocorticoid action are preferred, including blood pressure and heart rate — recognizing the challenges of accurate blood pressure measurement in small children — as well as serum potassium and PRA (activity or mass). An elevated PRA and decreased serum sodium levels, particularly when tachycardia and salt craving are also present, indicate salt-wasting 21OHD and inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement. Elevated serum potassium and inappropriate natriuresis are also consistent with relative mineralocorticoid deficiency. Adults with classic 21OHD are less prone to salt-wasting crises, particularly crises related to infectious diseases, than infants and small children, given their larger body size and generally high sodium content of the diet.

### Newly developed renin and prorenin assays and the clinical evaluation of renin inhibitors [^113FiJ18]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen the introduction of renin inhibitors and new plasma renin and prorenin assays, which has led to a better understanding of the tissue renin-angiotensin system.
- **Aim of the study**: To clarify the consequences of these developments for the methodology and interpretation of measurements of renin and prorenin.
- **Methods**: The principles and application of the newly developed immunosorbent assays (ISAs) are surveyed and the results are compared with those of enzyme-kinetic assays (EKAs).
- **Results and conclusions**: Angiotensin (Ang) II in cardiac, renal, and adrenal tissue is known to originate mainly from locally produced Ang I. Experimental evidence and theoretical considerations show that a simple relation between Ang II receptor occupancy in tissue micromilieu and the circulating levels of Ang II or renin may not exist. This supports the clinicians' view that the plasma level of renin tells more about the mechanisms regulating its release into the circulation than about the Ang II-dependency of hypertension. ISAs are a welcome addition to clinical studies of renin inhibitors. By comparing the results of ISAs with those of EKAs, the inhibitor-bound forms of renin and prorenin can be distinguished from the unbound forms. ISAs also provide important information on the molecular basis of prorenin activation. We propose a single kinetic model to incorporate the conformational changes of prorenin induced by cryo-activation and acid-activation, and by binding to renin inhibitors. It explains why renin ISAs can overestimate the rise of renin in response.

### Case detection in primary aldosteronism: High-diagnostic value of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio when performed under standardized conditions [^112DDjUQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The aldosterone-to-renin ratio is widely used and recommended as a screening modality for primary aldosteronism by the Endocrine Society Guideline. However, studies on its diagnostic accuracy have shown inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological limitations. We aimed to evaluate this diagnostic value by using a highly standardized study protocol that aligns with the Endocrine Society Guideline recommendations regarding indications for screening, testing conditions, and reference standards in daily clinical practice.

In this prospective study, 233 consecutive patients with difficult-to-control hypertension were enrolled at the University Medical Center Utrecht. In addition to aldosterone-to-renin ratio measurements, all patients underwent a saline infusion test as a reference standard. A plasma aldosterone concentration greater than 280 pmol/l after saline infusion was considered diagnostic for aldosteronism; plasma renin activity was assessed to exclude patients with secondary aldosteronism from a final primary aldosteronism diagnosis.

Correlation of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (cut-off > 5) with primary aldosteronism diagnosis showed 16 true positives, 29 false positives, 188 true negatives, and 0 false negatives. This resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (CI 75.9–100), specificity of 86.7% (CI 81.2–90.7), positive predictive value of 35.6% (CI 22.3–51.3), and negative predictive value of 100% (CI 97.5–100.0). The corresponding area under the curve was 0.933 (CI 0.900–0.966).

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^1149UBa9]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **Traditional approach**: The diagnosis and management of patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) begin with an initial diagnosis determined by a positive aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) screen accompanied by at least one positive confirmatory test. Subtype diagnosis, specifically lateralization, is pursued through adrenal imaging or adrenal vein sampling (AVS). Unilateral disease is typically treated with adrenalectomy of the affected adrenal gland, while bilateral disease often necessitates the use of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists.
- **Current roadblocks**: There are notable challenges in PA care, with suggested approaches to address these issues. These include:
	1. Enhanced screening and diagnosis of PA through the application of metabolomics and machine learning.
	2. Utilization of advanced lateralization techniques, such as molecular (functional) imaging, to allow precise tumor localization.
	3. Implementation of adrenal-sparing interventions, such as adrenal-sparing surgery or thermal ablation, where appropriate.
	4. Development of more selective pharmacological agents.

Overall, screening rates for PA remain low. Despite guidelines from the Endocrine Society and the American Heart Association, a population-based retrospective cohort study in Canada reported screening rates of only 3.9% among all patients with hypokalemia (K+ < 3.0 mEq/L) and hypertension, and 1% among patients taking four or more antihypertensive medications.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^114BJP1M]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are often empirically used for patients with low-renin hypertension (LRH) or probable primary aldosteronism (PA) who decline surgery. However, the optimal approach to MRA therapy is unknown. Studies have shown that a rise in renin is an effective biomarker for the prevention of cardiovascular complications of PA. This study aimed to determine whether empiric MRA therapy in patients with LRH or probable PA targeting unsuppressed renin is associated with a decrease in blood pressure and/or proteinuria.
- **Methods**: Retrospective single-center cohort study from 2005 to 2021 included adults with LRH or probable PA (renin activity 10 ng/dl) or low (< 10 ng/dl) aldosterone levels. The majority (24/39; 61.5%) of patients had at least one baseline antihypertensive medication stopped. Among the six patients who had detectable proteinuria and albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) measurements post-treatment, the mean ACR decreased from 179.0 to 36.1 mg/g (P = 0.03). None of the patients studied had to completely stop treatment due to adverse reactions.

### Renin as a prognostic marker in intensive care and perioperative settings: A scoping review [^115EFtZW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). High credibility.

Serum renin increases in response to sympathetic nerve activation and hypotension. Recent studies have reported the association of serum renin levels with adverse clinical outcomes in acute care settings. This scoping review aimed to systematically review the available literature on renin as a prognostic marker in intensive care and perioperative patients. We searched for studies published since inception until March 31, 2023, which assessed the association between serum renin levels and clinical outcomes or the effect of synthetic angiotensin II administration on serum renin levels in critically ill and perioperative patients in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up. The secondary outcomes were:

- **Adverse renal outcomes**: Acute kidney injury, the need for renal replacement therapy, and major adverse kidney events.
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Outcomes to angiotensin II administration, and prognostic performance for mortality when compared with lactate.

Among the 2081 studies identified, we included 16 studies with 1573 patients (7 studies on shock, 5 on nonspecific critical illness, 2 on cardiac surgery, 1 on noncardiac surgery, and 1 on coronavirus disease 2019). A significant association between serum renin levels and poor outcomes was identified in 14 studies, with 10 studies demonstrating an association with mortality. One post hoc analysis found that angiotensin II administration reduced mortality in patients with markedly elevated renin values. Two studies showed that renin was superior to lactate as a prognostic marker for mortality.

### Pharmacotherapy: Optimal blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^116j8i2J]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013).

Inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is a successful therapy for hypertension, heart failure, and renal insufficiency. Overdosing on RAAS inhibitors is occasionally observed when several agents are used together and can cause adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and renal failure. We advocate for optimal, rather than complete, RAAS blockade.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^114ASVYX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

The present study has several strengths, including an unselected patient population treated with a uniform protocol. It offers a pragmatic approach that utilizes widely available tests in primary care settings and off-patent medications. Notably, the study found effects that were so considerably pronounced that they remained highly statistically significant even in a relatively small population.

However, the findings should be interpreted considering its limitations. In the absence of a control group, the study cannot make causal claims. The sample size was relatively small, yet the effects of MRA therapy were nearly uniform, resulting in robust findings. Since data were collected from a single center within the practice of a single physician in eastern Massachusetts, the results may not be generalizable to other settings. Formal testing for primary aldosteronism (PA) was not conducted, as patients opted for pragmatic medical therapy. Other factors that could have affected renin levels, such as dietary sodium content or genotype, were not evaluated. The sample size was too small to examine potential effects of concomitant beta-blocker use. Most patients were unable to discontinue all non-MRA anti-hypertensive drugs, sometimes due to indications unrelated to hypertension. This could affect the explanatory component on blood pressure and renin measures from MRA therapy. Furthermore, information on the laboratory methodological data of the assays used to measure aldosterone is unavailable.

### A case of atypical reninoma with mild hypertension and normal plasma renin activity but elevated plasma renin concentration [^111Gbmvn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

- **Proposed diagnostic flowchart for reninoma diagnosis**: Features indicative of secondary hypertension include young age at onset (less than 30 years), sudden onset of hypertension, uncontrolled refractory hypertension, malignant hypertension, and hypokalaemia. Features of renal lesions indicative of reninoma include tumors occurring in adolescence or early adulthood, predominantly in females, characterized by a small (2–3 cm) solitary subcapsular mass that appears hypo- to isodense to the renal parenchyma, hypovascular in the arterial phase, with delayed enhancement on CT scan, or T1 hypointense, T2 hypointense, and hypovascular after contrast administration on MRI. If plasma renin activity is normal, verify by measuring direct renin concentration. Abbreviations: PRC, plasma renin concentration; PRA, plasma renin activity; SRVS, selective renal vein sampling.

Reninoma arises from the modified smooth muscle cells in the wall of the glomerular afferent arterioles that are part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In this case, besides positive immunostaining for CD34 and vimentin, positive immunostaining for synaptophysin (Syn) was also found, consistent with previous reports. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells exhibited characteristics of multidirectional differentiation and expressed epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuroendocrine markers. Although some cases have reported positive Syn immunostaining in tumor cells, consistent with our case, at the time of writing, there are no reports suggesting that reninoma could express somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and chromogranin A (CgA).

This study has several limitations. First, the level of angiotensin II (ATII) was not measured. Therefore, t

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^115JVAvN]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Of the 41 patients with suppressed renin treated with an MRA protocol to target unsuppressed renin, 39 patients had available information on baseline characteristics and outcomes and were included in the analysis. The median age of study patients was 67 years; all had hypertension, and the majority had diabetes. Most (30 out of 39; 76.9%) study patients were taking at least three anti-hypertensive medications prior to starting MRA therapy.

MRA therapy was titrated over a median of 59 (IQR 0–322) days, involving a mean of 3.6 (SD 3.9) titrations to the median dose of 50 (IQR 25–150) mg of spironolactone equivalent. Twelve (30.8%) patients were titrated to a spironolactone equivalent of more than 100 mg daily. Patients who achieved unsuppressed renin were titrated over a median of 54 (IQR 6.5–344) days, involving a median of 2.5 (IQR 1–4) titrations to the median dose of 50 (IQR 25–131.3) mg of spironolactone equivalent. The MRA dose required to achieve unsuppressed renin correlated with the baseline aldosterone levels. On average, the final MRA dose (in mg of spironolactone equivalents) needed to achieve unsuppressed renin was approximately 25 + 5×x, where x is the baseline aldosterone level (in ng/dl).
