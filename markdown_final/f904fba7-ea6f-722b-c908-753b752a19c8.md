## Question

Aki algorithm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about an AKI algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical framework and why we need a standardized algorithm. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and staging per KDIGO and reconcile any nuances. Next, I will examine risk stratification and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to check the etiologic workup and when to involve nephrology. Then, I will review management principles, including fluids, nephrotoxins, and drug dosing. I should also consider biomarkers and their practical role. Finally, I will integrate RRT decision-making, special populations, and quality metrics, and close with a concise algorithmic summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework and rationale for a standardized AKI algorithm. AKI is common, consequential, and often preventable, yet under-recognized; a uniform definition and staging system enables early detection, comparability, and quality improvement, though I should acknowledge that some expert groups caution against rigid stage-based management in the absence of stronger evidence for outcome benefit, which means the algorithm must remain clinically contextualized rather than purely protocolized [^60bef641] [^notfound] [^8a94b1f7].

> I need to verify the diagnostic criteria and staging next. KDIGO defines AKI as any of the following: an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours; staging is then applied from Stage 1 to Stage 3 based on larger creatinine multiples and more severe oliguria thresholds, with Stage 3 also including initiation of RRT or, in pediatrics, eGFR less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m², and patients are staged by the worst criterion met during the episode [^348bebdf] [^4d498821] [^7bb30059].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about baseline creatinine. I should confirm how to handle missing baselines and the timing windows. When baseline is unknown, using the admission creatinine is reasonable, and the diagnostic windows are 48 hours for the 0.3 mg/dL rise and 7 days for the 1.5× baseline rise; importantly, a 50% rise over 2 weeks does not meet AKI criteria unless there is a qualifying 48-hour jump, which helps avoid misclassification of subacute changes as AKI [^d355b433] [^47b316c4].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and monitoring cadence. Patients should be stratified by susceptibilities and exposures, with more frequent creatinine and urine output monitoring in those at higher risk; I need to ensure I individualize the frequency and duration of monitoring based on risk and clinical trajectory, and I should remember that urine output criteria require clinical judgment given confounders like diuretics, fluid status, and obesity, which can distort interpretation [^22ca0e36] [^c98f65d4] [^807beabc].

> I will now examine the etiologic workup, because identifying the cause guides therapy and prognosis. Prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes should be systematically considered, with attention to hypovolemia, low cardiac output, nephrotoxins, obstruction, and specific glomerular diseases; urinalysis with sediment, imaging for obstruction when indicated, and a medication reconciliation are essential, and nephrology consultation is appropriate when the cause is unclear or specialty input is needed [^6d745593] [^c5dc9efc] [^b9237b79] [^884a4eb1].

> Let me think about management principles next. Core measures include optimizing hemodynamics and volume status, avoiding or stopping nephrotoxins, and adjusting drug dosing to altered kinetics; I should confirm that these are prioritized across stages, with closer surveillance as severity increases, and I need to ensure that stage-based actions are framed as prompts rather than rigid mandates given the limited direct evidence for stage-driven interventions improving outcomes [^f5025f85] [^764ed978] [^8a94b1f7].

> But wait, what if we could detect injury earlier with biomarkers. I should double-check the current consensus. ADQI recommends considering a combination of damage and functional biomarkers alongside clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and management planning, yet routine staging refinement with biomarkers is not supported due to insufficient evidence; thus, biomarkers should augment, not replace, creatinine and urine output, and their best use is often in high-risk settings or when the clinical picture is equivocal [^2c7a36a3] [^6d56107f] [^1d692945] [^310961d2].

> I need to ensure the RRT decision framework is clear and evidence-aligned. Initiate emergently for life-threatening indications such as severe acidosis, hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema from volume overload, or uremic complications; outside emergencies, an expectant approach deferring RRT up to 72 hours is reasonable unless metabolic or fluid demands exceed kidney capacity, and decisions should integrate patient-specific factors, trajectory, and preferences; while biomarkers have been explored, they are not yet validated to dictate RRT timing, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^c62d9923] [^56465c62].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, the same KDIGO framework applies with the addition of eGFR less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m² as a Stage 3 criterion; in chronic kidney disease, relative creatinine rises still trigger AKI, but absolute thresholds may be less specific; in the ICU, continuous monitoring and dynamic risk assessment are crucial; in the community, under-recognition is common, so education and EHR prompts can mitigate missed cases [^4d498821] [^4300abcc] [^5736639c].

> Next, I should review quality metrics and system-level tools. Electronic alerts embedded in EHRs can improve process measures and, in some studies, outcomes, but results are heterogeneous and depend on implementation and clinician response; nonetheless, they remain a pragmatic way to operationalize KDIGO criteria and cue timely evaluation and mitigation steps [^92a302dd] [^65eafaf5].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between AKI and AKD so I don't mislabel subacute disease. AKD captures persistent decreases in kidney function or markers of damage lasting less than 3 months and not meeting AKI criteria, and it bridges AKI to CKD; recognizing AKD matters because it carries adverse outcomes and warrants follow-up and risk modification even when AKI criteria are not met [^534bfd3c] [^8e5fd912].

> Let me synthesize a concise, stepwise algorithm that aligns with this reasoning. First, screen for AKI using KDIGO criteria with creatinine and urine output and stage severity; second, risk-stratify by susceptibilities and exposures and set monitoring frequency; third, perform a focused etiologic workup and correct reversible causes; fourth, implement core management including hemodynamic optimization, nephrotoxin avoidance, and medication dosing adjustments; fifth, escalate care and consider nephrology consultation for severe or unclear cases; sixth, evaluate for RRT when indicated by life-threatening indications or persistent organ dysfunction despite conservative therapy; seventh, plan for recovery and follow-up given elevated long-term risks after AKI, including CKD surveillance and cardiovascular risk reduction [^348bebdf] [^22ca0e36] [^6d745593] [^f5025f85] [^c62d9923] [^b53e98ff].

---

The AKI algorithm is a **stepwise clinical pathway** for early detection, staging, and management of acute kidney injury using KDIGO criteria [^348bebdf] and clinical judgment. It flags AKI when serum creatinine rises ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, increases ≥ 1.5× baseline within 7 days, or urine output drops to ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours [^afcc1436], then stages severity to guide interventions. The algorithm emphasizes **prompt etiologic workup** [^6d745593], hemodynamic optimization, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and medication dosing adjustments [^764ed978]; it also integrates biomarkers and electronic alerts to enable earlier detection and improve outcomes [^2c7a36a3] [^92a302dd].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and staging

The algorithm uses **KDIGO criteria** to diagnose and stage AKI:

| **Stage** | **Serum creatinine criteria** | **Urine output criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or 1.5–1.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6–12 hours |
| Stage 2 | Increase 2.0–2.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥ 12 hours |
| Stage 3 | Increase ≥ 3.0× baseline within 7 days or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with ≥ 0.5 mg/dL rise, or initiation of RRT | ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria ≥ 12 hours |

---

Patients are staged by the **highest stage achieved** during the episode [^7bb30059].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

The algorithm includes a **structured assessment**:

- **Baseline renal function**: Establish pre-AKI eGFR/SCr to distinguish AKI from CKD [^534bfd3c].
- **Risk factors**: Identify susceptibilities (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, liver disease) and exposures (sepsis, nephrotoxins, surgery) [^22ca0e36].
- **Volume status**: Assess for hypovolemia or overload, as this guides therapy [^ea993caa].
- **Comorbidities**: Consider hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic workup

A **focused workup** is recommended to determine etiology:

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, bicarbonate, BUN, SCr, eGFR, urinalysis, urine sodium, and osmolality [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound to assess obstruction or chronicity [^notfound].
- **Specialized tests**: Consider ANCA, anti-GBM, complement, and drug levels as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stage-based and individualized**:

- **Stage 1**: Optimize hemodynamics, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust medications, and monitor closely [^notfound].
- **Stage 2**: Add nephrology consultation, consider biomarkers, and intensify monitoring [^notfound].
- **Stage 3**: Prepare for RRT, ICU transfer if indicated, and address life-threatening complications [^44084511].

---

## Integration of biomarkers and electronic alerts

Emerging biomarkers (e.g. NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) can detect AKI earlier than SCr/UOP and improve risk stratification [^2c7a36a3]; however, evidence is still evolving, so they should complement — not replace — standard criteria [^1d692945]. Electronic alerts embedded in EHRs improve **early detection** and care processes, though their impact on hard outcomes varies [^92a302dd] [^65eafaf5].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Creatinine lag**: SCr rises 24–48 hours after injury, delaying diagnosis [^044cf8a0].
- **Urine output variability**: Diuretics, obesity, and fluid status can confound UOP criteria [^807beabc].
- **Biomarker adoption**: Limited validation and cost hinder routine use [^6985a7d0].
- **Stage-based management**: Critics argue it may oversimplify care and lacks strong evidence [^8a94b1f7].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

- **Machine learning**: Models show promise for early AKI prediction but need external validation [^33ba35fd] [^239cd350].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarker-guided therapy may tailor interventions to injury phenotype [^2c7a36a3].
- **Consensus updates**: Ongoing work aims to refine definitions and integrate new evidence [^c0d7c3c2].

---

The AKI algorithm standardizes detection and staging while guiding timely, evidence-based management; ongoing refinement with biomarkers and digital tools is expected to **improve early recognition and outcomes** [^c0d7c3c2].

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^2b2b6f24]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^4300abcc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^907bb576]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^d248a3c8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Key messages

- AKI is a complex disorder, and we have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI on the basis of existing systems (that is, RIFLE). These proposals will require validation.

- Our recommendations have been endorsed by participating societies that represent the majority of critical care and nephrology societies worldwide.

- These recommendations provide a stepping stone to standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment strategies.

- Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require the development of collaborative networks. The AKIN was formed to provide an effective mechanism for facilitating such efforts.

### A framework and key research questions in AKI diagnosis and staging in different environments [^08df356e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common worldwide, and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. The RIFLE system of staging AKI correlates with survival in AKI in several settings. A similar AKI definition and staging system that also incorporates lesser degrees of serum creatinine elevation was proposed at the inaugural Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) meeting in 2005. At the Second AKIN meeting in Vancouver, Canada in September 2006, our group developed a research agenda that would test the utility of these diagnostic and staging criteria to predict patient outcomes in a variety of clinical settings and patient groups.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Three-day, international, consensus conference. A multidisciplinary stakeholder committee was divided into work groups. Recommendations for clinical practice and for future research were developed by the committee as an iterative process. This procedure consisted of a literature review phase and focus group interactions with presentations to the entire committee.

Results

We first proposed a conceptual framework of disease that describes a series of AKI stages, antecedents and outcomes, and allows a description of research recommendations based on transition between AKI stages. We further proposed methods for testing of the definition and development of research questions to establish the utility of new biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of AKI and associated illnesses.

Conclusions

Retrospective studies should be conducted to initiate the process of validating the AKIN definition of AKI, followed by comprehensive prospective studies that incorporate sampling for emerging AKI biomarkers.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^2c7a36a3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^133bced5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The need to introduce novel independent biomarkers of AKI into the clinical setting is crucial for earlier diagnosis and improved risk assessment. A parallel problem is the poor understanding of pathophysiology of AKI, which would be improved by the comprehensive characterization of the molecular pathways involved in the propagation of kidney injury.

Some etiological areas may benefit from further work or confirmatory trials in specific populations. However, the development of individual criteria and decision-making frameworks for the etiological variants of AKI is necessary to encompass the variety of factors that can influence clinical decisions. This exercise demands the consensus of experts regarding a proposed protocol for the inclusion of NGAL within evolved RIFLE criteria. At the same time, routine clinical utilization of injury biomarkers will probably be the solution for real advancement in this area.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^0b9ba918]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Subclinical AKI – an emerging syndrome with important consequences [^e845f92a]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

According to guidelines published by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) should be managed according to their susceptibilities and exposures. Clinical evaluation of a patient's risk of acute loss of renal function is of undisputed importance. However, such evaluations can be hindered by the complex presentations of critically ill patients and the lack of methods to detect early kidney damage. In this regard, a tool for diagnosis and stratification of patients at risk of AKI would complement clinical assessments and enable improved therapeutic decision-making. Emerging evidence suggests that 15–20% of patients who do not fulfil current serum-creatinine-based consensus criteria for AKI are nevertheless likely to have acute tubular damage, which is associated with adverse outcomes. This evidence supports reassessment of the concept and evolution of the definition of AKI to incorporate biomarkers of tubular damage.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^534bfd3c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

GFR/SCr algorithm — classification steps for no known kidney disease (NKD), acute kidney disorder/disease (AKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) proceed through three questions: first, "Is GFR decreased or is serum creatinine increased ?" with timing qualifiers "No Yes < 3 mo or unknown Yes > 3 mo" to sort into NKD, AKD, or CKD; second, "Is Scr increasing or GFR decreasing ?" including the branch "Yes-D, change in SCr meets AKD criteria but not AKI criteria"; and third, "Does the decrease in GFR or increase in Scr resolve within 3 months?" The text specifies that "The answer to Question 1 requires ascertainment of an index GFR/SCr as well during the prior 3 months" and that "Question 2 requires repeat ascertainment of kidney function after the index measure", with abbreviations defined on the figure legend.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^21a2af83]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 screening algorithm for diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults — identify adults at risk for CKD and test for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ± other markers of kidney damage. If GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and/or other markers of kidney damage are present, then after 3 months or earlier if evidence of chronicity measure eGFRcr-cys if not performed and available, stage according to GFR and ACR, establish underlying cause, estimate risk of progression, and initiate treatment. If testing has not been performed, test for GFR or ACR and exclude acute kidney injury (AKI)/acute kidney disease (AKD); if AKI/AKD present, follow AKI/AKD guidance. If GFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and ACR < 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and no other markers of kidney damage are present, CKD not present and timing of retesting is based on individual characteristics such as risk of progression; ACR and GFR are still required to determine stage and estimate risk of progression.

---

### Validated risk prediction models for outcomes of acute kidney injury: a systematic review [^f623fe3b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In recent years, few validated clinical models have been developed that can predict the outcomes of acute kidney injury in critically ill or hospitalized patients. The existence and use of such models, in addition to highlighting increased renal insufficiency, morbidity, and mortality following AKI, have significant implications for the future care needs of survivors. Future studies using machine learning prediction algorithms may improve the model design that can be better used in the clinical setting.

Screening algorithm for diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults — testing begins by identifying adults at risk for CKD and proceeding to "Test for GFR* and ACR ± other markers of kidney damage†". If initial testing finds "GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and/or other markers of kidney damage present", then "Test for GFR or ACR if not performed and exclude AKI/AKD", and if "AKI/AKD present: follow AKI/AKD guidance". Persistent abnormality "after 3 months or earlier if evidence of chronicity" leads to CKD confirmation; next steps include "Measure eGFRcr-cys if not performed and available" and then "Stage according to GFR and ACR, establish underlying cause, estimate risk of progression, initiate treatment". If instead "GFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and ACR < 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and no other markers of kidney damage present", then "CKD not present; timing of retesting based on individual characteristics such as risk of progression".

### Design, validation and implementation of an automated e-alert for acute kidney injury: 6-month pilot study shows increased awareness [^92a302dd]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden drop in kidney function that can develop within a few hours to days. AKI incidence has increased over the past years and affects more than 20% of hospitalized patient; it, is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, longer hospital stay and mortality. Despite the increased morbidity and mortality, AKI is often under-recognized and under-documented. Therefore, the ability to detect AKI episodes can improve outcomes and management of these patients, since there is no treatment available apart from reducing the causes (e.g. heart failure or infection) and triggers (e.g. administration of nephrotoxic medication).

To facilitate (early) diagnosis, multiple guidelines, such as the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), have been proposed to provide diagnostic criteria that evaluate changes in plasma creatinine (PCr). However, the KDIGO criteria are not routinely applied by physicians, hence AKI is often unrecognized. Without awareness and subsequent intervention(s), AKI can progress into chronic kidney disease (CKD) and require renal replacement therapy, thereby negatively influencing patients' outcomes, costs and quality of live.

To improve AKI awareness, the KDIGO criteria have been implemented before as a rule-based algorithm in electronic health record systems (EHR) as an electronic alert (e-alert) for automated AKI diagnosis. Most algorithms use changes in PCr to alert the treating physician via various communication systems (e.g. text message, email, message in the EHR system or phone). Several randomized controlled trials (RCT), and before-after studies have been conducted to study the clinical value of these e-alerts, though with varying results. Haase et al. (2017) reviewed 15 studies, both non-RCT and RCTs, and found improvements in care processes (e.g. stop of adjustment in nephrotoxic medication) and lower mortality in some studies. The heterogenous study designs as well as the various settings, may be the reason for these conflicting results.

### Characterization of risk prediction models for acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^33ba35fd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of AKI prediction models highlighted important limitations and challenges in this field, which profoundly limit the clinical utility of this literature in preventing AKI or defining high-risk populations in which preventative treatments can be tested. While no specific factors were found to drive the between-study heterogeneity, the high variability in the study populations, reported outcomes, and predictive variables are limiting the ability of studies to improve the outcomes of patients with AKI. More standardized approaches to the development and validation of prediction models are urgently needed and should cover aspects including study population selection, predictive variables selection, data analysis, performance assessment, and reporting paradigm.

AKI staging application and clarifications — Patients are "staged according to the highest (worst) stage", and because "SCr is measured and GFR can only be estimated, creatinine criteria should be used along with urine output for the diagnosis (and staging) of AKI". The text notes that "The changes in GFR that were published with the original RIFLE criteria do not correspond precisely to changes in SCr". For those reaching Stage 3 by creatinine, "For patients reaching Stage 3 by SCr > 4.0 mg/dl (> 354 μmol/l)… we instead require that the patient first achieve the creatinine based change specified in the definition (either > 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) within a 48-hour time window or an increase of ≥ 1.5 times baseline)", which "brings the definition and staging criteria to greater parity and simplifies the criteria".

### Role of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease: applications to chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury [^1ade18dc]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are global public health problems associated with a significant burden of morbidity, healthcare resource use, and all-cause mortality. This review explores recently published studies that take a machine learning approach to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication in patients with AKI or CKD.

Recent Findings

The release of novel therapeutics for CKD has highlighted the importance of accurately identifying patients at the highest risk of progression. Many models have been constructed with reasonable predictive accuracy but have not been extensively externally validated and peer reviewed. Similarly, machine learning models have been developed for prediction of AKI and have found sufficient accuracy. There are issues to implementing these models, however, with conflicting results with respect to the relationship between prediction of an AKI outcome and improvements in the occurrence of other adverse events, and in some circumstances potential harm.

Summary

Artificial intelligence models can help guide management of CKD and AKI, but it is important to ensure that they are broadly applicable and generalizable to various settings and associated with improved clinical decision-making and outcomes.

### Initiative: recommendations for awareness, recognition, and management of AKI [^5736639c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Nephrology has established a new initiative, AKI!Now, with the goal of promoting excellence in the prevention and treatment of AKI by building a foundational program that transforms education and delivery of AKI care, aiming to reduce morbidity and associated mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we describe our current efforts to improve early recognition and management involving inclusive interdisciplinary collaboration between providers, patients, and their families; discuss the ongoing need to change some of our current AKI paradigms and diagnostic methods; and provide specific recommendations to improve AKI recognition and care. In the hospital and the community, AKI is a common and increasingly frequent condition that generates risks of adverse events and high costs. Unfortunately, patients with AKI may frequently have received less than optimal quality of care. New classifications have facilitated understanding of AKI incidence and its impact on outcomes, but they are not always well aligned with AKI pathophysiology. Despite ongoing research efforts, treatments to promote or hasten kidney recovery remain ineffective. To avoid progression, the current approach to AKI emphasizes the promotion of early recognition and timely response. However, a lack of awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment among health care team members and the heterogeneity of approaches within the health care teams assessing the patient remains a major challenge. Early identification is further complicated by differences in settings where AKI occurs (the community or the hospital), and by differences in patient populations and cultures between the intensive care unit and ward environments. To address these obstacles, we discuss the need to improve education at all levels of care and to generate specific guidance on AKI evaluation and management, including the development of a widely applicable education and an AKI management toolkit, engaging hospital administrators to incorporate AKI as a quality initiative, and raising awareness of AKI as a complication of other disease processes.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^30721da6]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — research recommendations state that the role of biomarkers other than SCr in the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of AKI patients should be explored, including early detection where the gold standard is AKI by clinical diagnosis after the fact and the biomarker is compared to existing markers (SCr and urine output) at the time of presentation; prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict risk for AKI or risk for progression of AKI; and prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict recovery after AKI vs. death or need for long-term RRT. The influence of urinary output criteria on AKI staging needs to be further investigated, and influence of fluid balance, percent volume overload, diuretic use, and differing weights (actual, ideal body weight, lean body mass) should be considered; also, it is currently not known how urine volume criteria should be applied. The influence of whether SCr or eGFR criteria are used should be tested through simulation, and whether relative and absolute SCr increments or eGFR decrements at different time points and with differently ascertained baseline values requires further exploration and validation in various populations.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^2165497a]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

KDIGO AKI clinical applications — example cases illustrate diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) using serum creatinine (SCr)-based criteria. Cases A–F have baseline SCr and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that exceeds 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 so none has pre-existing CKD, and AKI can be diagnosed by applying the first two criteria: at least 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours or a 50% increase from presumed baseline; these are labeled in the table as Criterion 1 50% from baseline and Criterion 2 ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 μmol/l) rise in ≤ 48 hours, and meeting either criterion 1 or 2 (or 3, urine output) qualifies. Illustratively, for Case A the serum creatinine mg/dl (μmol/l) values are baseline 1.0 (88), day 1 1.3 (115), day 2 1.5 (133), day 3 2.0 (177), and day 7 1.0 (88), with Yes for both criteria. Cases F–H do not have a baseline measurement of SCr available. Early diagnosis may improve outcome so it is advantageous to diagnose patients as rapidly as possible, and frequent measurement of SCr in high-risk patients, or in patients in which AKI is suspected, will significantly improve diagnostic time and accuracy.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management.

### Potential use of biomarkers in acute kidney injury: report and summary of recommendations from the 10th acute dialysis quality initiative consensus conference [^e5f1df20]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in the discovery and development of biomarkers of kidney disease, and several have now been evaluated in different clinical settings. Although there is a growing literature on the performance of various biomarkers in clinical studies, there is limited information on how these biomarkers would be utilized by clinicians to manage patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Recognizing this gap in knowledge, we convened the 10th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting to review the literature on biomarkers in AKI and their application in clinical practice. We asked an international group of experts to assess four broad areas for biomarker utilization for AKI: risk assessment, diagnosis, and staging; differential diagnosis; prognosis and management; and novel physiological techniques including imaging. This article provides a summary of the key findings and recommendations of the group, to equip clinicians to effectively use biomarkers in AKI.

### Timing of initiation and discontinuation of renal replacement therapy in AKI: unanswered key questions [^22328a24]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) often require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently, there is wide variation worldwide on the indications for and timing of initiation and discontinuation of RRT for AKI. Various parameters for metabolic, solute, and fluid control are generally used to guide the initiation and discontinuation of therapy; however, there are currently no standards in this field. Members of the recently established Acute Kidney Injury Network, representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI, participated in a 3-d conference in Vancouver in September 2006 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. Key questions included the following: what are the indications for RRT, when should acute RRT support be initiated, and when should RRT be stopped? This report summarizes the available evidence and describes in detail the key questions, and some of the methods of answering them that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with AKI and improving outcomes.

Limitations of current AKI definitions — criteria remain limited by inconsistent application, underuse of urine output, exclusion of patients with elevated baseline SCr, and probable community-acquired cases; preliminary data from a 20 000-patient database suggest roughly a third of AKI may be community-acquired, and biomarkers of renal cell injury may identify additional patients and detect AKI earlier.

Rationale for a guideline on AKI — AKI is a global problem with immediate and long-term adverse outcomes, more prevalent in and a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), with individuals with CKD especially susceptible; the burden may be greatest in developing countries, and early detection to prevent progression to kidney failure requiring dialysis is of paramount importance, yet preventable risk factors are not widely known and variably practiced.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^ea993caa]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of acute kidney injury [^aa15ded5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

AKI is an increasingly common disorder that is strongly linked to short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite a growing heterogeneity in its causes, providing a timely and certain diagnosis of AKI remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the evolution of AKI biomarker studies over the past few years, focusing on two major areas of investigation: the early detection and prognosis of AKI. We highlight some of the lessons learned in conducting AKI biomarker studies, including ongoing attempts to address the limitations of creatinine as a reference standard and the recent shift toward evaluating the prognostic potential of these markers. Lastly, we suggest current gaps in knowledge and barriers that may be hindering their incorporation into care and a full ascertainment of their value.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^1dc2ca40]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classification for acute kidney injury is a diagnostic and severity grading system used in patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This calculator is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients.

The AKIN classification system is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.

The AKIN classification system is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool helps identify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) by evaluating changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. The user starts by selecting one diagnostic criterion from a list of options, each reflecting different clinical measures.

These criteria include:

- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.
- Serum creatinine increase to or beyond 4 mg/dL (354 mcmol/L), with a rapid increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L), or over 3 times the baseline value. This is associated with urine output below 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or complete lack of urine for 12 hours.

Using these criteria, the tool assigns an AKI stage:

- Stage 1 corresponds to the selection where serum creatinine increases are at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–2 times above baseline paired with specified urine output reduction over 6 hours.
- Stage 2 signifies a creatinine increase of more than 2–3 times from baseline with decreased urine output extending past 12 hours.
- Stage 3 is indicated by the most severe changes in creatinine and urine output metrics, the latter showing significant reduction or lack of production over longer durations.

Each stage reflects increasing AKI severity, impacting clinical evaluation and management decisions. Recognizing the stage is critical for patient outcomes, steering appropriate interventions and monitoring.

Conclusions

While the development of biomarkers has shown potential to enhance early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and risk stratification of AKI, their widespread clinical application is still evolving. These biomarkers may eventually contribute to personalized care and precise clinical decision-making and may inform the development of future therapies. However, their limitations in specificity, predictive accuracy, and clinical applicability remain. Future research should focus on identifying more sensitive and specific biomarkers and validating their clinical value through large-scale trials.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^d30aa2ad]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria were introduced in 2004, defining the clinical stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome measures based on serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and urine output. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that these markers are insufficient in drawing an accurate illustration of kidney injury. Indeed, mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that accuracy and speed of patient evaluation are lacking. A great deal of evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a sensitive and specific early marker of various etiological classes of AKI and would be highly valuable in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction (kidney attack). Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring will benefit clinical decision-making in the individualized bundling of therapies and ongoing patient management. In particular, kidney protection and AKI prevention may become feasible if an earlier and more accurate diagnosis is made for AKI. Here, we discuss the opportunity to consider whether NGAL is ready for routine clinical use in a number of etiologies of AKI.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^c62d9923]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Biomarker strategies to predict need for renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^9e5b5317]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The early detection and diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the standardization of novel kidney-injury-specific biomarkers is one of the highest research priorities in nephrology. Accordingly, the majority of studies of novel AKI biomarkers have focused on the early diagnosis of AKI using serum creatinine-based definitions as the gold standard. However, another potential application of kidney-injury-specific biomarkers is for guiding decisions on when to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT). The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings concerning some of the more promising AKI biomarkers on their capacity, either alone or integrated with traditional surrogate measures of kidney injury, for early prediction of whether patients will develop severe AKI requiring RRT. Some studies that have examined neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin-C, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, kidney injury molecule-1, and α(1)-microglobulin, among others, have suggested that these novel biomarkers have the potential to distinguish patients in whom RRT will be needed. This would imply that these biomarkers may be integrated into clinical decision algorithms and could synergistically improve our current ability to predict worsening AKI and need for RRT. However, published studies have many recognized limitations, which preclude our ability to adapt their findings into clinical practice today. While currently available data are not sufficient to conclude that biomarkers should be used routinely for clinical decision making for RRT initiation, additional data may in the future significantly modify the clinical variability for initiation of RRT, and potentially translate into improved outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Finally, we propose a potential approach to future biomarker strategies for RRT initiation, integrating these biomarkers with "traditional" clinical factors.

### Reading between the (guide) lines – the KDIGO practice guideline on acute kidney injury in the individual patient [^bd7b6cfc]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^e74e7c72]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Acute kidney injury: from clinical to molecular diagnosis [^396a751f]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The RIFLE classification was introduced in 2004 to describe the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and to define its clinical stage, based upon the serum creatinine level and urine output. The same criteria, although slightly modified, are used in the other scoring systems AKIN and KDIGO. Mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that current diagnostic methods are suboptimal, poorly accurate, and often timely inadequate in detecting the presence of early kidney injury. Conversely, a growing body of evidence indicates that new AKI biomarkers can be used to both rule out AKI and to assess high-risk conditions or the presence of subclinical forms. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or cell cycle arrest biomarkers seem to be sensitive and specific enough to be used in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction. Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring may improve prevention and protection from organ damage and help to identify patients at risk, allowing individualized therapy. In this view, we may say that AKI diagnosis has finally moved from clinical to molecular level with potential benefits for the patients because similar progress has been shown in other disciplines.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^d190984b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^3e2eb30c]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "RIFLE diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The RIFLE criteria is a clinical calculator used to classify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI). The acronym RIFLE stands for Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease. This scoring system applies to patients who are at risk of developing AKI, particularly those in critical care settings such as the intensive care unit.

The RIFLE criteria is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategy and predict patient outcomes.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the RIFLE criteria. However, it may not be applicable or accurate in patients with chronic kidney disease or other conditions that affect baseline creatinine levels or urine output. It's also important to note that the RIFLE criteria does not identify the cause of AKI, so further diagnostic evaluation may be necessary.

The RIFLE criteria for diagnosing acute kidney injury involve assessing the severity based on changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine output. Based on user input, the criteria determine a classification level: Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, or End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

Here's how the computation works:

- **Risk, RIFLE-R**: Identified when the serum creatinine level is 1.5 to 2 times above baseline, or the GFR shows more than a 25% decrease below baseline. Urine output is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

- **Injury, RIFLE-I**: Occurs if the serum creatinine level is more than 2 to 3 times above baseline, or there is more than a 50% decrease in GFR below baseline. This stage includes urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours.

- **Failure, RIFLE-F**: Determined when serum creatinine exceeds 3 times above baseline or reaches 4 mg/dL (350 mcmol/L) or an acute rise of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L). It also indicates a GFR decrease of over 75% below baseline. Urine output is critically low, at less than 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or anuria (complete absence of urine) for 12 hours.

- **Loss, RIFLE-L**: Describes persistent acute kidney injury lasting over 4 weeks.

- **ESRD, RIFLE-E**: Represents end-stage renal disease extending for more than 3 months.

The user's input concerning these criteria leads to a categorical diagnosis aligning with the RIFLE classification system, providing a structured perspective on the severity and progression of acute kidney injury.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^d710114e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary on KDIGO AKI definition — The Work Group states they have significant reservations regarding the applicability of this definition and staging system to clinical practice, while supporting its use for research and comparisons. They question whether these criteria are currently appropriate to guide clinical management of adult patients and emphasize that the successive stages of a serum creatinine–based AKI definition reflect a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity; at low stages, sensitivity is high but specificity is low. They add that particularly in the United States the KDIGO definition may result in a dramatic increase in nephrology consultations. Pediatric notes include that the KDIGO definition considers a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 35 mL/min/ 1.73 m² to be stage 3 AKI in pediatric patients and that an absolute change in creatinine level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL would capture most pediatric AKI.

Acute Kidney Injury Predictor Validation Study ClinicalTrials. gov ID
- AUROC comparison
- Comparison of the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves between the predictions made by the AKIpredictor and the ones made by ICU physicians, to predict AKI 2–3. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of AKIpredictor, a computer-based algorithm that predicts the development of AKI in the 7 days following ICU admission, by comparing it with similar predictions made by attending physicians.

Primary objective: To compare the performances of AKIpredictor and physicians in predicting AKI stage 2 or 3 in the 7 days following ICU admission Secondary objective: To investigate the influence of the level of seniority of the physician on the accuracy of the predictions; feasibility of making predictions within a 3 hour window for physicians Trial Design: Monocentric, prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional Endpoints: Primary: comparing the area under the ROC curves of the AKIpredictor and physicians. Computer predictions: Elements from laboratory reports, clinical history and physiological monitoring will be used both by clinicians and by the computer algorithm to estimate the risk of AKI. Such measurements are part of the routine standard care in the ICU: no additional exam will be required for this study. These values are regularly stored in the electronic health care system.

They will be retrieved in read-only mode when needed for formulating the predictions. The retrieval will take place regularly on a weekly basis in order to limit the amount of time that patients' identification data will be stored for the study. Interviews to multiple physicians about the same patient in the same time frame will be encouraged, as long as they are not influenced by one another. A ROC curve will be plotted both for the computer-based AKIpredictor and the continuous estimate of AKI risk assessed by the clinicians at each of the three time-points. The area under the curve of each plot will be calculated. The AUCs will then be compared in pairs by bootstrapping, and a significance value of the comparison will be derived. Subgroup analysis will be performed with the same approach.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^b3eac921]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^56465c62]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been much debated. Over the past five years several studies have provided new guidance for evidence-based decision-making. High-quality evidence now supports an approach of expectant management in critically ill patients with AKI, where RRT may be deferred up to 72 h unless a life-threatening indication develops. Nevertheless, physicians' judgment still plays a central role in identifying appropriate patients for expectant management.

### A proposed algorithm for initiation of renal replacement therapy in adult critically ill patients [^dfdd6cfd]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients whose course is complicated by acute kidney injury often receive renal replacement therapy (RRT). For these patients, initiation of RRT results in a considerable escalation in both the complexity and associated cost of care. While RRT is extensively used in clinical practice, there remains uncertainty about the ideal circumstances of when to initiate RRT and for what indications. The process of deciding when to initiate RRT in critically ill patients is complex and is influenced by numerous factors, including patient-specific and clinician-specific factors and those related to local organizational/logistical issues. Studies have shown marked variation between clinicians, and across institutions and countries. As a consequence, analysis of ideal circumstances under which to initiate RRT is challenging. Recognizing this limitation, we review the available data and propose a clinical algorithm to aid in the decision for RRT initiation in critically ill adult patients. The algorithm incorporates several patient-specific factors, based on evidence when available, that may decisively influence when to initiate RRT. The objective of this algorithm is to provide a starting point to guide clinicians on when to initiate RRT in critically ill adult patients. In addition, the proposed algorithm is intended to provide a foundation for prospective evaluation and the development of a broad consensus on when to initiate RRT in critically ill patients.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^c0d7c3c2]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice. Large epidemiology studies and risk profiles for AKI have become available in adults and children, such as the AKI–Epidemiologic Prospective Investigation (AKI-EPI) study, the 0by25 Initiative, the Southeast Asia–AKI (SEA-AKI) study, and the Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina, and Epidemiology (AWARE)and Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology in Neonates (AWAKEN)studies. The effectiveness of the KDIGO recommendations in preventing AKI has been confirmed in small single-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs), such as the Prevention of AKI (PrevAKI)and the Biomarker Guided Intervention for Prevention of AKI (BigpAK)studies. In addition, results of RCTs have provided new data relevant to several facets of preventing and managing AKI, including early resuscitation, fluid therapy, prevention of contrast-associated AKI, and timing of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT). – Finally, there is now evidence from large studies in different countries that the use of KDIGO criteria for AKI, as part of computer decision-support systems, can improve clinical outcomes. However, there has also been important progress in the development of new tools to diagnose and manage AKI, including biomarkers, decision support programs, and electronic alerts, that go beyond the current KDIGO definition/staging criteria, and these warrant consideration for inclusion in AKI guidelines. –

These advances are not without controversy. Adoption of new biomarkers has been heterogenous, and there are calls to revise KDIGO AKI staging based on creatinine and urine output, and even calls to discard the KDIGO staging completely. Thus, in April 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury, in Rome, Italy. Participants examined and summarized evidence published since 2012 as it relates to the risk assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients with AKI and provided commentary on areas of controversy and agreement. The ultimate goals were to provide the clinical and research communities with a snapshot of the current state of the art for diagnosis and management of AKI and to prepare for future revision of the 2012 guideline.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^9c44e943]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

We discuss the performance of novel biomarkers in acute kidney injury (AKI). Comparison of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of several biomarkers with some clinical and/or routine biochemical outcome parameters reveals that none of the biomarkers has demonstrated a clear additional value beyond the traditional approach in clinical decision making in patients with AKI. Unscrutinized use of these biomarkers may distract from adequate clinical evaluation and carries the risk of worse instead of better patient outcome.

It is recognized that it is frequently not possible to determine the cause, and often the exact cause does not dictate a specific therapy; however, the syndrome of AKI includes some patients with specific kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis) for which a specific treatment is available. As such, it is always necessary to search for the underlying cause of AKI.

Diagnosis of acute kidney disease

AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days and CKD starts when kidney disease has persisted for more than 90 days. Based on epidemiological studies and histological case series, it is clear that some patients have a slow but persistent (creeping) rise in serum creatinine over days or weeks but do not strictly fulfil the consensus criteria for AKI. To classify this phase between the early stage of AKI (first 7 days) and the onset of CKD (beyond 3 months), the KDIGO expert group proposed the term "acute kidney disease" (AKD) and suggested the following criteria: a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for < 3 months, a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35%, and an increase in serum creatinine by > 50% for < 3 months or evidence of structural kidney damage for < 3 months. These criteria are currently under revision (personal communication with the ADQI group).

### The pressing need for real-time risk assessment of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [^78db7a18]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is associated with short- and long-term outcomes that reflect the severity of the injury. Recent studies have suggested that 'early' initiation of renal replacement therapy may alter the course of AKI and improve short-term outcomes like inpatient mortality. The current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition of AKI has been criticized for misclassification bias, lack of sensitivity and the static manner in which AKI stages are defined. This editorial reviews various approaches to improving the specificity and sensitivity of the KDIGO AKI criteria, and also concludes that a staging system based on creatinine trajectories would be better suited for developing a prognostic index for real-time, dynamic risk assessment that the current KDIGO staging criteria.

### Failing kidneys: renal replacement therapies in the ICU [^2de08174]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of AKI

There have been varying definitions to diagnosis and classify AKI. Three of the most used systems include Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of Kidney Function, and End-stage Kidney Disease (RIFLE), Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). They all incorporate some combination of timing of renal dysfunction onset, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and urine output (UOP) into their assessment strategy. The RIFLE classification system was first introduced in 2004 by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group. This system defined AKI as a rise in serum creatinine by greater than 50% over 7 days and focused on levels of decreased GFR and UOP along with rising creatinine to define the stages of AKI — Risk, Injury and Failure. The AKIN modified RIFLE in 2007. Key elements included shortening the initial time of symptoms to 48 hours, decreasing the initial rise in serum creatinine to 0.3, and excluding GFR. More recently, there has been a push towards adoption of the KDIGO Acute Kidney Injury Group classification system, which aims to blend the RIFLE and AKIN criteria into a single unified definition of AKI. Table 1 highlights the commonalities and differences between these systems. Comparison studies in critically ill patients have noted that application of KDIGO leads to an increased diagnosis of AKI and is more predictive of in-hospital mortality.

### Classification and staging of acute kidney injury: beyond the RIFLE and AKIN criteria [^044cf8a0]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often overlooked in hospitalized patients, despite the fact that even mild forms are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular failure and infections. Research endorsed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative led to the publication of a consensus definition for AKI — the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease) — which was designed to standardize and classify renal dysfunction. These criteria, along with revised versions developed by the AKI Network (AKIN), can detect AKI with high sensitivity and high specificity and describe different severity levels that aim to predict the prognosis of affected patients. The RIFLE and AKIN criteria are easy to use in a variety of clinical and research settings, but have several limitations: both utilize an increase in serum creatinine level from a hypothetical baseline value and a decrease in urine output, but these surrogate markers of renal impairment manifest relatively late after injury has occurred and do not consider the nature or site of the kidney injury. New biomarkers for AKI have shown promise for early diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of AKI. As more data become available, they could, in the future, be incorporated into improved definitions or criteria for AKI.

Methods

Data sources and searches

Two independent evaluators searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library using combined free texts and MeSH terms relating to the perioperative period, acute kidney injury, and AI (prior to October 2021). The abstracts of all identified studies were reviewed to exclude irrelevant articles. Full-text reviews were conducted to determine whether the inclusion criteria were satisfied in all the studies. We also manually checked the reference lists of relevant publications including reviews and commentaries to include eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved by a discussion between two evaluators. Additional file 1 shows the detailed search strategy.

Selection criteria

Studies were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) AKI was defined using consensus criteria such as RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO, or studies with clear AKI definitions; (2) the main outcome was the onset of AKI during the immediate pre-operative period until the time of discharge; (3) application of the AI algorithm for the prediction of perioperative acute kidney injury; (4) inclusion of diagnostic performance indices of the AI algorithm, including specificity, sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), or the figure of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which enables the construction of a 2 × 2 diagnostic table; and (5) human adult subjects.

The exclusion criteria were the studies that were not original studies such as letters, comments, editorials, protocols or reviews.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^3908e2fb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### The definition of acute kidney injury and its use in practice [^2f664db8]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome that is independently associated with increased mortality. A standardized definition is important to facilitate clinical care and research. The definition of AKI has evolved rapidly since 2004, with the introduction of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE), AKI Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. RIFLE was modified for pediatric use (pRIFLE). They were developed using both evidence and consensus. Small rises in serum creatinine are independently associated with increased mortality, and hence are incorporated into the current definition of AKI. The recent definition from the international KDIGO guideline merged RIFLE and AKIN. Systematic review has found that these definitions do not differ significantly in their performance. Health-care staff caring for children or adults should use standard criteria for AKI, such as the pRIFLE or KDIGO definitions, respectively. These efforts to standardize AKI definition are a substantial advance, although areas of uncertainty remain. The new definitions have enabled the use of electronic alerts to warn clinicians of possible AKI. Novel biomarkers may further refine the definition of AKI, but their use will need to produce tangible improvements in outcomes and cost effectiveness. Further developments in AKI definitions should be informed by research into their practical application across health-care providers. This review will discuss the definition of AKI and its use in practice for clinicians and laboratory scientists.

### Automated acute kidney injury alerts [^65eafaf5]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common and probably one of the more consequential complications of critical illnesses. Recent information indicates that it is at least partially preventable; however, progress in its prevention, management, and treatment has been hindered by the scarcity of knowledge for effective interventions, inconsistencies in clinical practices, late identification of patients at risk for or with AKI, and limitations of access to best practices for prevention and management of AKI. Growing use of electronic health records has provided a platform for computer science to engage in data mining and processing, not only for early detection of AKI but also for the development of risk-stratification strategies and computer clinical decision-support (CDS) systems. Despite promising perspectives, the literature regarding the impact of AKI electronic alerts and CDS systems has been conflicting. Some studies have reported improvement in care processes and patient outcomes, whereas others have shown no effect on clinical outcomes and yet demonstrated an increase in the use of resources. These discrepancies are thought to be due to multiple factors that may be related to technology, human factors, modes of delivery of information to clinical providers, and level of expectations regarding the impact on patient outcomes. This review appraises the current body of knowledge and provides some outlines regarding research into and clinical aspects of CDS systems for AKI.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".
