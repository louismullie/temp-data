## Question

When to x ray for back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain an X-ray for low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline principle that routine imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated low back pain. Then, I should verify the red flags that warrant immediate imaging. Next, I will consider the time-based thresholds after which imaging becomes reasonable if symptoms persist. After that, I need to check special populations and anatomic regions where the threshold differs. Finally, I should review the evidence on harms and costs of unnecessary imaging and synthesize a practical decision framework with clear indications for when to order an X-ray versus when to avoid it.

> Let me first confirm the baseline principle. For acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain without red flags, routine imaging — including plain radiography — is not recommended, and this is consistently endorsed by major guidelines and Choosing Wisely campaigns because imaging does not improve pain, function, or quality of life and may cause harm through incidental findings and downstream interventions [^112sULD9] [^113BXcmc] [^112TNJNZ].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that should trigger immediate imaging. I need to ensure I capture the high-risk features: suspected fracture (significant trauma, osteoporosis, chronic glucocorticoid use), suspected infection (fever, immunosuppression, IV drug use), suspected malignancy (history of cancer, unintentional weight loss, age over 50 with new pain), and severe or progressive neurologic deficits including cauda equina syndrome. In these scenarios, imaging is indicated because results are likely to change management and delay risks harm [^114UwfEa] [^1152weWt] [^114oCWXB].

> Hold on, I should verify the time-based thresholds. For non-specific low back pain without red flags, guidelines advise no imaging in the first 4 to 6 weeks; after about 6 weeks of persistent symptoms despite appropriate conservative care, imaging can be considered, though the evidence for routine X-ray at this point is limited and mixed, and some guidelines remain inconclusive about cost-effectiveness or clinical utility of plain films in this window [^116xcjhc] [^115p24MX] [^114krsGZ] [^113Xf2PH].

> I will now examine special populations and anatomic regions. In older adults, I initially thought early imaging might be justified broadly, but wait, let me reconsider; a large prospective cohort of adults 65 and older found early imaging did not improve 1-year outcomes, so age alone is not an indication for early imaging, though osteoporosis and low-velocity trauma still raise fracture risk and may lower the threshold to image when clinically suspected [^111uP7Su] [^114oCWXB]. For thoracic back pain, routine imaging is not advised without myelopathy, radiculopathy, or red flags; consider thoracic X-ray in subacute or chronic pain or when fracture risk is present, and escalate to MRI if serious pathology is suspected [^114Lq71v] [^111xBR72]. For pediatric nontraumatic back pain, imaging is reserved for persistent symptoms beyond about 4 weeks or the presence of red flags such as night pain, constant pain, fever, weight loss, or neurologic deficits [^113nJW8F] [^111ikCPa].

> Next, I should review the evidence on harms and costs of unnecessary imaging. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show no improvement in pain or function with immediate imaging versus usual care, while observational data link early imaging to increased surgery, opioid prescribing, and costs without better outcomes. Incidental findings like disc degeneration are common in asymptomatic people and can provoke anxiety and overtreatment, reinforcing a selective imaging approach [^112TNJNZ] [^114iscmr] [^113cvKB1].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Do not obtain an X-ray for uncomplicated low back pain without red flags, especially in the first 4 to 6 weeks. Obtain imaging urgently when red flags are present or neurologic deficits are severe or progressive. After 6 weeks of persistent symptoms despite conservative therapy, consider imaging if the result is likely to change management, recognizing that plain radiography has limited yield and MRI is preferred when serious pathology is suspected or intervention is planned. In children, use a lower threshold for persistent symptoms or systemic signs and start with radiographs if imaging is needed [^111AMUxe] [^113BXcmc] [^1152weWt] [^113nJW8F].

> But wait, what if the patient is requesting an X-ray for reassurance? I should double-check how to counsel here. Patient education that explains the lack of benefit and potential harms of routine imaging, combined with a clear self-management plan and follow-up, addresses common drivers of imaging requests and aligns with high-value care; shared decision-making can be used if the patient strongly prefers imaging after counseling, documenting the discussion and rationale [^111AMUxe] [^111NvZk3].

> Final answer: Obtain a lumbar spine X-ray when there are red flags suggesting fracture, infection, malignancy, or severe/progressive neurologic deficits. Otherwise, avoid routine imaging in the first 4 to 6 weeks of non-specific low back pain, and after that window consider imaging only if symptoms persist despite appropriate conservative care and the imaging result is likely to change management, keeping in mind that MRI is generally preferred when serious pathology is suspected or intervention is contemplated [^111AMUxe] [^113BXcmc] [^1152weWt].

Routine imaging is **not recommended** for acute low back pain without red flags [^113BXcmc] [^111AMUxe]. Obtain an X-ray when **red flags** are present — trauma, osteoporosis, prolonged steroid use, age > 65, fever, weight loss, history of cancer, or neurologic deficits — or if pain persists beyond 6 weeks despite conservative care [^116xcjhc] [^115p24MX]. X-ray is also indicated for suspected infection, malignancy, or fracture [^115p24MX]. Routine imaging does not improve outcomes and may cause harm through radiation, incidental findings, and unnecessary procedures [^112TNJNZ] [^113cvKB1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative organizations provide clear guidance on when to obtain X-rays for back pain:

- **American College of Physicians (ACP)**: Do not obtain routine imaging for patients with nonspecific low back pain [^115J3ogT] [^114hvKiN].

- **American College of Radiology (ACR)**: Do not obtain routine imaging for acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain without red flags or prior management [^113BXcmc].

- **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)**: Do not obtain diagnostic imaging within the first 6 weeks unless red flags are present [^1163LDmg].

- **North American Spine Society (NASS)**: Insufficient evidence to recommend routine imaging in the absence of red flags [^111xCq7q].

---

## Red flag indications for imaging

Imaging is indicated when **red flags** suggest serious underlying conditions:

| **Red flag category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Trauma | - Recent significant trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Prolonged steroid use <br/> - Age > 65 years [^114oCWXB] |
| Infection | - Fever <br/> - Immunosuppression <br/> - Intravenous drug use [^114UwfEa] |
| Malignancy | - History of cancer <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Age > 50 years with new-onset pain [^115fawnV] |
| Neurologic deficits | - Severe or progressive neurologic deficits <br/> - Cauda equina syndrome [^1152weWt] |

---

## Duration of symptoms and persistence

Imaging is generally not recommended for acute low back pain (< 6 weeks) without red flags [^1163LDmg]. Consider imaging if pain persists beyond 6 weeks despite conservative management, especially if it **significantly impacts daily activities** or if the patient is a candidate for intervention [^1152weWt].

---

## Potential harms of unnecessary imaging

Unnecessary imaging can cause **significant harms**:

- **Radiation exposure**: Increased cancer risk, particularly with repeated exposures [^116scxd3].

- **Incidental findings**: Lead to unnecessary anxiety, further testing, and interventions [^113cvKB1].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Higher direct and indirect costs without improved outcomes [^113cvKB1].

- **Overtreatment**: Higher rates of surgery, injections, and opioid prescriptions without benefit [^114iscmr].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

Before imaging, use **clinical evaluation and diagnostic triage** to classify back pain as nonspecific or specific. Most cases are nonspecific and improve with conservative care, including education, reassurance, exercise, and analgesics [^115NutWU]. Reserve advanced imaging (**MRI**) for suspected serious pathology or when results will change management [^112sULD9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Routine imaging is **not recommended** for acute low back pain without red flags [^113BXcmc]. Obtain an X-ray when red flags are present or pain persists beyond 6 weeks despite conservative care. Weigh potential harms of unnecessary imaging against limited benefits [^114hvKiN].

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain [^115fawnV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Question

What are the best red flags to indicate the possibility of fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain in primary, secondary, or tertiary care?

Summary Answer

Older age, prolonged corticosteroid use, severe trauma, and presence of a contusion or abrasion increase the likelihood of spinal fracture (likelihood was higher with multiple red flags); a history of malignancy increases the likelihood of spinal malignancy.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

### Treatment patterns in patients with diagnostic imaging for low back pain: a retrospective observational study [^115pnm7z]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain Medication Therapies

Throughout the whole observation period, 51,900 patients (85.3%) received at least one pain medication and 5678 (9.3%) patients received pain medication in all periods. The proportion of patients with pain medication therapy was higher in patients with a combination of imaging studies (X-ray/MRI or X-ray/CT) compared to patients with one imaging only (P < 0.001 for all comparisons): any prescription (90.8% vs 84.6%), NSAID (82.7% vs 74.7%), paracetamol (64.6% vs 59.7%), and opioids (45.7% vs 32.8%). Patients with combinations of diagnostic imaging methods had the highest odds of pain medication prescriptions (OR: 1.81. 95% CI: 1.66, 1.96, P < 0.001). In patients with a pain medication prescription, NSAIDs, paracetamol, or opioids were prescribed in 88.6%, 70.7%, and 40.3%, respectively. Moreover, 61.9% of patients with NSAID therapy had proton pump inhibitor (PPI) co-medication. Considering only patients with an opioid prescription, 17% of patients in this group were prescribed a strong opioid. Moreover, strong opioids accounted for 30.7% of all opioid prescriptions. The odds of receiving a specific class of pain medication was dependent on the imaging method used and on the timing of prescription (Figure 2).

Randomized and observational evidence on x-ray referral in LBP without red flags — one Level II study shows that in the absence of red flags, x-rays do not provide additional benefit at initial consultation. Across 94 general practices, over the course of 26 months, patients with LBP aged 16–64 years were allocated to a RCT (n = 153) or an observational arm (n = 506); the RCT randomized to immediate x-ray referral (n = 73) or no immediate x-ray referral (control) (n = 80). Outcomes were assessed at enrollment, 6 weeks and one year, with response rate at one year 67%. In the RCT there were no differences in physical functioning, pain, or disability compared to control, but the immediate radiography group scored higher on psychological wellbeing at 6 weeks and one year. In the observational arm, after adjusting for length of back pain episode at presentation, there were no differences in physical outcomes, and those referred for x-ray had lower depression scores at six weeks and one year. The work group downgraded this potential Level I study due to poor follow-up, significant crossover and potential bias, and this study provides Level II evidence that, in the absence of red flags, x-ray does not provide additional benefit at initial consultation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Low back pain [^1179CjUZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Abdominal X-ray… [^112wMJJv]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

An abdominal x-ray is an x-ray of the abdomen. It is sometimes abbreviated to AXR, or KUB. Indications In adults, abdominal X-rays have a very low specificity and cannot rule out suspected obstruction, injury or disease reliably. CT scan provides an overall better diagnosis, allows surgical strategy planning, and possibly fewer unnecessary laparotomies. Abdominal x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults with acute abdominal pain presenting in the emergency department. In children, abdominal x-ray is indicated in the acute setting:

- Suspected bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal perforation; Abdominal x-ray will demonstrate most cases of bowel obstruction, by showing dilated bowel loops.
- Foreign body in the alimentary tract; can be identified if it is radiodense.
- Suspected abdominal mass
- In suspected intussusception, an abdominal x-ray does not exclude intussusception but is useful in the differential diagnosis to exclude perforation or obstruction. In trauma, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury. Projections The standard abdominal X-ray protocol is usually a single anteroposterior projection in supine position. Special projections include a PA prone, lateral decubitus, upright AP, and lateral cross-table. A minimal acute obstructive series includes two views: typically, a supine view and an upright view, although a lateral decubitus could be substituted for the upright. Coverage on the x-ray should include from the top of the Liver to the pubic symphysis.

The abdominal organs included on the xray are the liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, and bladder. KUB KUB stands for Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder. The KUB projection does not necessarily include the diaphragm. The projection includes the entire urinary system, from the pubic symphysis to the superior aspects of the kidneys. The anteroposterior abdomen projection, in contrast, includes both halves of the diaphragm. If the patient is large, more than one film loaded in the Bucky in a "landscape" direction may be used for each projection. This is done to ensure that the majority of bowel can be reviewed. A KUB is a plain frontal supine radiograph of the abdomen. It is often supplemented by an upright PA view of the chest and a standing view of the abdomen.

Despite its name, a KUB is not typically used to investigate pathology of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder, since these structures are difficult to assess In order to assess these structures radiographically, a technique called an intravenous pyelogram was historically utilized, and today at many institutions CT urography is the technique of choice. KUB is typically used to investigate gastrointestinal conditions such as a bowel obstruction and gallstones, and can detect the presence of kidney stones. The KUB is often used to diagnose constipation as stool can be seen readily. The KUB is also used to assess positioning of indwelling devices such as ureteric stents and nasogastric tubes. KUB is also done as a scout film for other procedures such as barium enemas.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^112sULD9]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The clinical problem

The past two decades have seen a paradigm shift in the way we use imaging when managing low back pain (LBP). Imaging was once a routine part of the diagnostic workup for most cases of LBP. Evidence now indicates that imaging is useful only in the small subgroup of patients for whom there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fracture, and severe neurological deficits — which together account for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases (called non-specific or uncomplicated LBP), imaging will not guide management and can cause more harm than benefit. International guidelinesand "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now encourage a diagnostic triage approach to identify those patients who require imaging (box 1). Given these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should be decreasing, but recent systematic reviews show the opposite, reporting that imaging has increased over the past 20 yearsand that at least a third of all images are unnessary.

Box 1
"Choosing Wisely" statements from different countries related to avoiding the use of routine imaging for low back pain

"Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particular evidenced-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada
"Do not undertake imaging for low back pain in patients without indications of a serious underlying condition". — Australian Rheumatology Association, Choosing Wisely Australia
"Do not routinely offer imaging in a non-specialist setting for people with low back pain with or without sciatica. Consider imaging in specialist settings of care (for example, a musculoskeletal interface clinic or hospital) for people with low back pain with or without sciatica only if the result is likely to change management". — Royal College of Physicians, Choosing Wisely UK

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115tEBou]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

LBP is a common condition in the USA — approximately 80% of adults have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffer from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the USA, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for LBP receive lumbar spine radiography, CT or MRI. However, for most patients with acute non-specific LBP, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without improved patient outcomes.

National quality guidelines, such as The National Committee of Quality Assurance's Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), established the quality measure for use of image studies for LBP in efforts to improve rates of appropriate imaging in the healthcare setting. Despite these evidence-based guidelines, significant variability in clinical practice exists, with imaging studies often used to diagnose aetiology of acute non-specific LBP.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on low back pain [^114Sn7hb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without radiculopathy is one of the most common health problems in the United States, with high annual costs of evaluation and treatment, not including lost productivity. Multiple reports show that uncomplicated acute low back pain or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Guidelines for recognition of patients with more complicated status can be used to identify those who require further evaluation for suspicion of more serious problems and contribute to appropriate imaging utilization.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: systematic review [^111YZq4y]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policymakers

Unnecessary imaging is a concern in many settings, with adverse consequences for the patient and society. Our review shows that the advice, provided in some guidelines, to refer all patients with a single positive red flag for imaging is unwise. Given that 80% of patients in primary care might have at least one positive red flag, such a course would mean that most patients with low back pain would receive diagnostic imaging. In contrast, our review is consistent with the approach in the guidelines of the American College of Physicians guideline and othersto first of all consider the probability of serious disease (given the specific red flags present) when making decisions about the need for and timing of imaging. Our results suggest that many guidelines will need revision so that they provide advice for practice that is more firmly grounded in the relevant diagnostic research.

Unanswered questions and future research

Our review has highlighted the need for more high quality diagnostic research on the topic. Much of the existing research has evaluated single clinical features and our results suggest it might be more useful to evaluate combinations of clinical features, as is done with decision rules such as the Ottawa ankle ruleand Canadian C-Spine Rule. While some decision rules are available, all are at the derivation stage and await external validation. There is a need for systematic reviews of red flags to screen for other conditions such as infection and ankylosing spondylitis. Finally, consideration of the optimal way to provide this information so that it is available to the clinician at the point of care, in a readily understood format, is an important topic for future research.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114iscmr]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Early imaging for low back pain — evidence of harms: In a very large retrospective matched cohort (n = 405,965) of patients with non-specific lumbar pain, lumbar MRI performed within six weeks of symptom onset was associated with a higher probability of surgery, greater prescription opioid use, increased costs of care, and higher pain scores; the early MRI group was 13 times more likely to undergo lumbar surgery (1.48% versus 0.12%), and associated acute care costs were 1.4 times greater ($8,082 versus $5,560). In patients with low back pain without red flags, routine imaging led to increased costs, healthcare utilization, and absence from work, and imaging did not provide health benefits; the systematic review included "six RCTs and eight observational studies", and overall quality of evidence was "moderate with harms and burdens outweighing benefits".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^113YVuoR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for low back pain, more specifically with respect to patients with upper back pain, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain thoracic spine X-ray or MRI or CT of the thoracic spine in adult patients with thoracic back pain with low-velocity trauma, osteoporosis, advanced age, and/or chronic corticosteroid use.
Consider obtaining contrast-enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine, whole body bone scan, or bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as initial imaging in patients aged > 65 years and in patients with osteoporosis, prior benign non-traumatic compression fracture, or chronic corticosteroid use.

### Imaging strategies for low-back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TNJNZ]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Some clinicians do lumbar imaging routinely or in the absence of historical or clinical features suggestive of serious low-back problems. We investigated the effects of routine, immediate lumbar imaging versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging on clinical outcomes in patients with low-back pain and no indication of serious underlying conditions.

Methods

We analysed randomised controlled trials that compared immediate lumbar imaging (radiography, MRI, or CT) versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging for low-back pain. These trials reported pain or function (primary outcomes), quality of life, mental health, overall patient-reported improvement (based on various scales), and patient satisfaction in care received. Six trials (n = 1804) met inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers with criteria adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Meta-analyses were done with a random effects model.

Findings

We did not record significant differences between immediate lumbar imaging and usual care without immediate imaging for primary outcomes at either short-term (up to 3 months, standardised mean difference 0.19, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.39 for pain and 0.11, -0.29 to 0.50 for function, negative values favour routine imaging) or long-term (6–12 months, -0.04, -0.15 to 0.07 for pain and 0.01, -0.17 to 0.19 for function) follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Trial quality, use of different imaging methods, and duration of low-back pain did not affect the results, but analyses were limited by small numbers of trials. Results are most applicable to acute or subacute low-back pain assessed in primary-care settings.

Interpretation

Lumbar imaging for low-back pain without indications of serious underlying conditions does not improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should refrain from routine, immediate lumbar imaging in patients with acute or subacute low-back pain and without features suggesting a serious underlying condition.

### Effectiveness of interventions to decrease image ordering for low back pain presentations in the emergency department: a systematic review [^114BEr5t]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is an extremely frequent reason for patients to present to an emergency department (ED). Despite evidence against the utility of imaging, simple and advanced imaging (i.e., computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging) for patients with LBP has become increasingly frequent in the ED. The objective of this review was to identify and examine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing image ordering in the ED for LBP patients.

Methods

A protocol was developed a priori, following the PRISMA guidelines, and registered with PROSPERO. Six bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Dissertation Abstracts) and the gray literature were searched. Comparative studies assessing interventions that targeted image ordering in the ED for adult patients with LBP were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened study eligibility and completed data extraction. Study quality was completed independently by two reviewers using the before-after quality assessment checklist, with a third-party mediator resolving any differences. Due to a limited number of studies and significant heterogeneity, only a descriptive analysis was performed.

Results

The search yielded 603 unique citations of which a total of five before-after studies were included. Quality assessment identified potential biases relating to comparability between the pre- and postintervention groups, reliable assessment of outcomes, and an overall lack of information on the intervention (i.e., time point, description, intervention data collection). The type of interventions utilized included clinical decision support tools, clinical practice guidelines, a knowledge translation initiative, and multidisciplinary protocols. Overall, four studies reported a decrease in the relative percentage change in imaging in a specific image modality (22.7%-47.4%) following implementation of the interventions; however, one study reported a 35% increase in patient referrals to radiography, while another study reported a subsequent 15.4% increase in referrals to CT and myelography after implementing an intervention which reduced referrals for simple radiography.

Discussion

While imaging of LBP has been identified as a key area of imaging overuse (e.g. Choosing Wisely recommendation), evidence on interventions to reduce image ordering for ED patients with LBP is sparse. There is some evidence to suggest that interventions can reduce the use of simple imaging in LBP in the ED; however, a shift in imaging modality has also been demonstrated. Additional studies employing higher-quality methods and measuring intervention fidelity are strongly recommended to further explore the potential of ED-based interventions to reduce image ordering for this patient population.

### What is usual care for low back pain? A systematic review of health care provided to patients with low back pain in family practice and emergency departments [^111eLDxU]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines for low back pain (LBP) contain consistent recommendations including universal provision of information and advice to remain active, discouraging routine referral for imaging, and limited prescription of opioids. This systematic review describes usual care provided by first-contact physicians to patients with LBP. Studies that reported the assessments and care provided to people with LBP in family practice and emergency departments (EDs) from January 2000 to May 2019 were identified by searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Study quality was assessed with reference to representativeness of samples, potential misclassification of patients, potential misclassification of outcomes, inconsistent data and precision of the estimate, and the findings of high-quality studies were prioritized in the data synthesis. We included 26 studies that reported data from almost 195,000 patients: 18 from family practice, and 8 from EDs. Less than 20% of patients with LBP received evidence-based information and advice from their family practitioner. Around 1 in 4 patients with LBP received referral for imaging in family practice and 1 in 3 in EDs. Up to 30% of patients with LBP were prescribed opioids in family practice and up to 60% in EDs. Large numbers of patients who saw a physician for LBP received care that is inconsistent with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Usual care included overuse of imaging and opioid prescription and underuse of advice and information. Suboptimal care may contribute to the massive burden of the condition worldwide.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115KfSf5]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

In response, we sought to build awareness and enhance engagement and buy-in by conducting educational sessions with key ordering provider groups in internal medicine (eg, attending physicians, hospitalists and residents) to review clinical practice variabilities and share information from the Choosing Wisely campaign about avoiding imaging studies for acute non-specific LBP without specific indications.

During this first phase, all LBP imaging orders were examined to see if they met appropriate HEDIS criteria and to isolate where and why HEDIS quality measures may be lower than desired for acute non-specific LBP imaging orders. During clinic rounding, HEDIS criteria were communicated with providers to improve adherence and documentation.

For our next phase of the study, we implemented changes to the EMR. Prior to implementation, guidance was not provided for image ordering for non-specific LBP. Working with information technology, we developed CDS order sets and built practice alerts and reminders in the EMR to marry the clinical guidelines with our institution's order entry system that established a standardised workflow for non-specific LBP. A new order panel (see figure 1) was developed that required patients to meet specific criteria to minimise inappropriate imaging and improve guideline-adherent practice. After the history and physical examination of the patient, providers were required to answer a series of questions during the order entry process. Provider responses placed patients presenting with LBP into categories (eg, non-specific LBP; LBP associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis; LBP associated with other specific spinal causes) that included discrete indications for X-ray, MRI and CT scans based on evidence-based recommendations for appropriate imaging. As such, diagnostic imaging studies were to be performed only in those patients who have severe or progressive neurologic deficits or were suspected of having a serious or specific underlying condition (eg, cancer, trauma). Access to imaging was denied when providers did not document compliance with institutionally approved indications though providers were allowed to proceed with an override by entering an active acknowledgement for opposing recommendations.

### Imaging versus no imaging for low back pain: a systematic review, measuring costs, healthcare utilization and absence from work [^111Q1Zwo]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Imaging (X-ray, CT and MRI) provides no health benefits for low back pain (LBP) patients and is not recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Whether imaging leads to increased costs, healthcare utilization or absence from work is unclear. Therefore, this study systematically reviews if imaging in patients with LBP leads to an increase in these outcomes.

Methods

We searched PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science until October 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OSs), comparing imaging versus no imaging on targeted outcomes. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. The quality of the body of evidence was determined using GRADE methodology.

Results

Moderate-quality evidence (1 RCT; n = 421) supports that direct costs increase for patients undergoing X-ray. Low-quality evidence (3 OSs; n = 9535) supports that early MRI may lead to an increase in costs. There is moderate-quality evidence (1 RCT, 2 OSs; n = 3897) that performing MRI or imaging (MRI or CT) is associated with an increase in healthcare utilization (e.g., future injections, surgery, medication, etc.). There is low-quality evidence (5 OSs; n = 15,493) that performing X-ray or MRI is associated with an increase in healthcare utilization. Moderate-quality evidence (2 RCTs; n = 667) showed no significant differences between X-ray or MRI groups compared with non-imaging groups on absence from work. However, low-quality evidence (2 Oss; n = 7765) did show significantly greater mean absence from work in the MRI groups in comparison with the non-imaging groups.

Conclusions

Imaging in LBP may be associated with higher medical costs, increased healthcare utilization and more absence from work. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Ottawa ankle rules… [^117GSBag]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

In medicine, the Ottawa ankle rules are a set of guidelines for clinicians to help decide if a patient with foot or ankle pain should be offered X-rays to diagnose a possible bone fracture. Before the introduction of the rules most patients with ankle injuries would have been imaged. However the vast majority of patients with unclear ankle injuries do not have bone fractures. As a result, many unnecessary X-rays were taken, which was costly, time-consuming and a slight health risk due to radiation exposure. The Ottawa ankle rules Ankle X-ray Ankle X-ray is only required if:

- There is any pain in the malleolar zone; and,
- **Any one of the following**:

- Bone tenderness along the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the tibia or tip of the medial malleolus, OR
- Bone tenderness along the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the fibula or tip of the lateral malleolus, OR
- An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps.

Foot X-ray series Additionally, the Ottawa ankle rules indicate whether a foot X-ray series is required. It states that it is indicated if:

- There is any pain in the midfoot zone; and,
- **Any one of the following**:

- Bone tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal, OR
- Bone tenderness at the navicular bone, OR
- An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps. Certain groups are excluded, in particular pregnant women, and those with diminished ability to follow the test. Several studies strongly support the use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules in children over 6; however, their usefulness in younger children has not yet been thoroughly examined. Usefulness The rules have been found to have a very high sensitivity, moderate specificity, and therefore a very low rate of false negatives.

Evidence supports the rules as an accurate instrument for excluding fractures of the ankle and mid-foot, reducing the number of unnecessary investigations and length of stay in emergency departments. The original study reported that the test was 100% sensitive and reduced the number of ankle X-rays by 36%. A second trial with a larger number of patients replicated these findings. Subsequently, a multi-centre study explored the feasibility of implementing the rules on a wider scale. Teaching the rules to patients does not appear to help reduce presentation to hospital. History This list of rules was published in 1992 by a team of doctors in the emergency department of the Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa, Canada. Since the rules were formulated in Ottawa they were dubbed the Ottawa ankle rules by their creators a few years after their development, a title that has stuck.

In this respect, the naming of the rules is similar to that of the Bristol stool scale or the Glasgow Coma Scale, which also take their names from the cities in which they were formulated. Related rules The original rules were developed for ankle and foot injuries only, but similar guidelines have been developed for other injuries such as the Ottawa knee rules.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBack pain-child [^113nJW8F]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

It is now generally accepted that nontraumatic back pain in the pediatric population is common. The presence of isolated back pain in a child has previously been an indication for imaging; however, recently a more conservative approach has been suggested using clinical criteria. The presence of constant pain, night pain, and radicular pain, alone or in combination, lasting for 4 weeks or more, constitute clinical red flags that should prompt further imaging. Without these clinical red flags, imaging is likely not indicated. Exceptions include an abnormal neurologic examination or clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology, and when present should prompt immediate imaging. Initial imaging should consist of spine radiographs limited to area of interest, with spine MRI without contrast to evaluate further if needed. CT of the spine, limited to area of interest, and Tc-99m bone scan whole body with single-photon emission computed tomography may be useful in some patients. The addition of intravenous contrast is also recommended for evaluation of a potential neoplastic or infectious process. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Association of early imaging for back pain with clinical outcomes in older adults [^111uP7Su]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In contrast to the recommendations for younger adults, many guidelines allow for older adults with back pain to undergo imaging without waiting 4 to 6 weeks. However, early imaging may precipitate interventions that do not improve outcomes.

Objective

To compare function and pain at the 12-month follow-up visit among older adults who received early imaging with those who did not receive early imaging after a new primary care visit for back pain without radiculopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort of 5239 patients 65 years or older with a new primary care visit for back pain (2011–2013) in 3 US health care systems. We matched controls 1:1 using propensity score matching of demographic and clinical characteristics, including diagnosis, pain severity, pain duration, functional status, and prior resource use.

Exposures

Diagnostic imaging (plain films, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of the lumbar or thoracic spine within 6 weeks of the index visit.

Primary Outcome

back or leg pain-related disability measured by the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (score range, 0–24; higher scores indicate greater disability) 12 months after enrollment.

Results

Among the 5239 patients, 1174 had early radiographs and 349 had early MRI/CT. At 12 months, neither the early radiograph group nor the early MRI/CT group differed significantly from controls on the disability questionnaire. The mean score for patients who underwent early radiography was 8.54 vs 8.74 among the control group (difference, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.71 to 0.50]; mixed model, P = 0.36). The mean score for the early MRI/CT group was 9.81 vs 10.50 for the control group (difference,-0.51 [-1.62 to 0.60]; mixed model, P = 0.18).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among older adults with a new primary care visit for back pain, early imaging was not associated with better 1-year outcomes. The value of early diagnostic imaging in older adults for back pain without radiculopathy is uncertain.

### X-ray… [^1137aGRd]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

An X-ray is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays. Roughly, X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 10 nanometers to 10 picometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range of 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz and photon energies in the range of 100 eV to 100 keV, respectively. X-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, so X-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics and materials science. However X-rays are ionizing radiation and exposure can be hazardous to health, causing DNA damage, cancer and, at higher intensities, burns and radiation sickness. Their generation and use is strictly controlled by public health authorities. In 1901, U. S.

President William McKinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt while attending the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found. A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but was not used. While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later. Hazards discovered With the widespread experimentation with X‑rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dudley was X-rayed. In August 1896, H. D.

Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an X-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with X-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all. On 3 August 1905, in San Francisco, California, Elizabeth Fleischman, an American X-ray pioneer, died from complications as a result of her work with X-rays.

Hall-Edwards developed a cancer sufficiently advanced by 1904 to cause him to write papers and give public addresses on the dangers of X-rays. His left arm had to be amputated at the elbow in 1908, and four fingers on his right arm soon thereafter, leaving only a thumb. His amputated left hand was placed at Birmingham University as a specimen. He died of cancer in 1926. To detect the hardness of the tube, the spark gap was initially opened to the widest setting. While the coil was operating, the operator reduced the gap until sparks began to appear. A tube in which the spark gap began to spark at around 6. 4 centimeters was considered soft and suitable for thin body parts such as hands and arms. A 13-centimeter spark indicated the tube was suitable for shoulders and knees. An 18-to-23-centimeter spark would indicate a higher vacuum suitable for imaging the abdomen of larger individuals.

What you need to know

Less than 5–10% of all low back pain is due to a specific underlying spinal pathology
The remaining 90–95% has no indication of a serious cause and should be managed with conservative treatments such as advice and reassurance, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive-behavioural therapy, or pain management
Diagnostic triage based on clinical history and examination can help distinguish between non-specific or more serious low back pain
Imaging may do more harm than good when serious conditions are not suspected and is likely to prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain
Patients' primary concerns of whether their pain is caused by something serious and what they should do to aid recovery can be addressed by sound education and reassurance, without the need for imaging

Communication style — Findings from a recent qualitative study suggests four key behaviours from clinicians that can help patients feel reassured.

Show that you "know the whole story" by summarising the patient's medical history and conducting a thorough assessment
Demonstrate empathy and communicate that you are qualified and experienced, helping the patient to feel that they are "seeing the right person"
Reduce the use of generic statements such as "nothing to worry about" and recognise the patient's distress
Explain the likely cause(s) of LBP and provide a clear self management plan to help the patient understand and manage their LBP.

Monitoring — Regularly monitor image ordering practices and LBP outcomes relative to peers. This will reassure clinicians that the changes to practice that they implement are effective and do not result in patient harm.

Search methods

We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library to identify published systematic reviews on (i) the use of LBP imaging, (ii) the concordance of imaging with guidelines, (iii) physician reported barriers to guideline adherence, (iv) patient expectations around LBP imaging, and (v) interventions that have been used to change LBP imaging practice. Additionally, we consulted experts in LBP and primary care on relevant published evidence and the most up to date LBP guidelines internationally.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^113cvKB1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The evidence for change

Evidence from randomised controlled trials has established that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, and several observational studies have linked liberal imaging with greater work absence and unnecessary use of health services. Unnecessary LBP imaging has the potential for harm. Perhaps the most obvious of these harms is exposure to radiation from x rays and computed tomography. Harm is also possible if a clinician acts on incidental findings from any imaging method, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or if these findings are not appropriately explained to patients. For example, disc abnormalities such as bulging disc or degenerative disc disease are commonly seen on images but may not be the source of pain, as they are also seen on images in up to 97% of asymptomatic patients (table 1). Incidental findings may lead to further investigations, specialist referral, and more intensive treatment such as surgery, which limits access to those services for the patients who are in genuine need of such care. Incidental findings may also provoke worry or concern in patients from a labelling effect (possibly delaying recovery) if they fail to understand that these anomalies are common and benign.

Table 1
Age-specific prevalence estimates of degenerative spine imaging findings in asymptomatic people

Imaging and follow-up based on incidental findings affects the health system in terms of direct costs (such as cost of equipment, staff time to conduct the imaging, and time to interpret the image findings) and downstream costs (subsequent tests, referrals, and interventions, many of which are expensive and are of limited benefit for most patients with back pain). The downstream costs of imaging also affect patients and society due to indirect costs relating to out of pocket expenses for unnecessary interventions, as well as expenses related to lost work or household productivity. Two systematic reviews of six randomised controlled trials (1804 participants) both concluded that patients who received imaging without a clear clinical indication did not have improvements to pain, function, or quality of life compared with those who did not have imaging. Additionally, observational studies have found that those who received imaging when not indicated had greater use of health services such as injections and surgery and greater work absence than their counterparts who did not receive imaging. For example, a 2020 study of 405 965 US primary care patients found that those who had early MRI were more likely to undergo back surgery (1.48% v 0.12%) and take prescription opioids (35.1% v 28.6%), yet had higher pain score at 1-year follow-up (3.99 v 3.87) than those who did not get early MRI.

### Treatment patterns in patients with diagnostic imaging for low back pain: a retrospective observational study [^116GeQWv]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The majority of patients who had undergone diagnostic imaging for LBP received non-opioid and short-term pain medication therapies, in accordance with international guidelines. Nevertheless, the rate of opioid use was high, particularly for strong opioids. Given the scant evidence of their effectiveness in acute LBP and the potential adverse outcomes and addiction associated with the use of opioids in non-cancer patients, the findings of our study emphasized the importance of the prudent use of opioids in patients with LBP.

### Low back pain… [^1142X7ch]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

In most episodes of low back pain a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by "red flags" such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful or recommended for low back pain that lasts less than 6 weeks and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. Signs and symptoms In the common presentation of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending.

The symptoms may start soon after the movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point, to diffuse pain. It may or may not worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first. Pain sensation Pain erupts in response to a stimulus that either damages or can potentially damage the body's tissues. There are four main stages: transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation.

The nerve cells that detect pain have cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia and fibers that transmit these signals to the spinal cord. The process of pain sensation starts when the pain-causing event triggers the endings of appropriate sensory nerve cells. This type of cell converts the event into an electrical signal by transduction. Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the transducing cell to the posterior horn of spinal cord, from there to the brain stem, and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the thalamus and the limbic system. In the brain, the pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain perception. Through modulation, the brain can modify the sending of further nerve impulses by decreasing or increasing the release of neurotransmitters.

Parts of the pain sensation and processing system may not function properly; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much pain from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain. Diagnosis As the structure of the low back is complex, the reporting of pain is subjective, and is affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others. The ICD 10 code for low back pain is M54.
5. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

Results

Basic Characteristics

A total of 60,822 patients (mean age: 53.5 y, 56.1% female) were included in the study (Figure 1, Table 1). MRI (44.5%) and X-ray (34%) were the most commonly performed single diagnostic imaging methods. In patients with a combination of diagnostic imaging studies (X-ray/MRI and X-ray/CT) the proportion of patients with the X-ray before, after, or on the same day as an MRI/CT was 66.4%, 15.9%, and 17.7%; and 56.1%, 18.6%, and 25.3%, respectively. In the year of imaging, 19.4% of the patients had one comorbidity and 5.6% two or more comorbidities. Patients with a CT of the spine (CT alone or in combination with an X-ray) were older on average and had more comorbidities compared to patients with an X-ray or MRI (mean age 59.32 vs 52.83 y; mean number of comorbidities 0.42 vs 0.3, P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^117Lcm3T]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern supported by this survey is how EBM is perceived across geographical regions. As noted in the Results, spinal surgeons from Asia and Africa answered less accurately on EBM's correct definition and use than those of North America and Europe. Since EBM can be successfully applied in spine surgery, future training and education must incorporate the teaching of proper EBM understanding and implementation. The incorporation of EBM in education and training is supported by current literature. Furthermore, it may be worth it for spinal surgeons to use social media, conferences, or training online to integrate EBM education opportunities to more easily reach underdeveloped regions of the world and provide opportunities for those who were unable to acquire this education during their medical schooling.

Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for applying to a spinal surgeon. However, the order of obtaining further diagnostic imaging modalities in the absence of red flags remains a debate. Most of the participants opted to obtain an MRI. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against obtaining imaging in the absence of red flags and the type of imaging. A striking difference was observed in the imaging modality amongst geographical locations. While most participants from North America and Europe opted for an MRI, most respondents from Asia and Africa stated they'd prefer an X-ray/CT before an MRI. This may be due to a higher availability of X-ray/CT compared to MRI in regions from responders who were less likely to order an MRI; alternatively, the recommendation for X-ray/CT instead of MRI could be if a patient does not present with any red flags with lower back pain that warrants an MRI. Thus, X-ray/CT is chosen first. Another clinical scenario evaluated was an extruded disc with no leg pain. These patients sometimes undergo unnecessary surgery due to radiological findings; however, most of the respondents opted for physical and medical therapy. The notion of "treat the patient, not the image" has been well settled in the spine surgery society. However, the debate of "what to treat with physical and medical therapy if no leg pain is present" arises at this point.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^11581kLH]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Patient perspectives

Clinicians often report that they order imaging when patients specifically request it. Systematic reviews of surveys and interviews suggest that about half of patients expect imaging from their health provider because they believe it can help rule out a sinister cause for the pain. Some patients also believe that imaging can identify the cause better than the clinician's physical exam and facilitate a more tailored approach to treatment. There is still considerable uncertainty as to what alternatives to imaging would convey the diagnosis of non-specific LBP satisfactorily from the patient's perspective. Future research should focus on this area to develop strategies for explaining LBP to patients.

### Treatment patterns in patients with diagnostic imaging for low back pain: a retrospective observational study [^115PG4hC]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed treatment patterns in 60,822 patients who had undergone diagnostic imaging of the spine because of LBP. We observed that only a minority of patients with pain medication therapy received different pain medications and the mean amount of prescribed pain medications corresponded to short-term therapies. We found a substantial use of opioids and within opioid prescriptions a high proportion (31%) were for strong opioids. Finally, the usage of NPT was associated with higher amounts of prescribed pain medications.

Spine Imaging and Associated Treatment Patterns

Although often inappropriate, radiological imaging of the spine is common in patients with acute LBP. In our study, MRI was the most common imaging method, surpassing X-ray. The relative distribution of the type of imaging used varied widely between different studies and settings and may be influenced by different national guidelines, but X-ray examinations are in general the most commonly reported modalities. However, although MRI or CT are superior to X-ray in many diagnostic issues, and one could observe an increasing use of MRI/CT, the common use of X-rays in our study sample may have been owing to easier and more timely access to X-ray equipment. In accordance with international guidelinesand similar to observational data from the USA or Italy, our study showed a high percentage of pain medication prescriptions (85%). Patients with combinations of diagnostic imaging methods, in particular X-ray/CT, had the highest odds of pain medication prescriptions. Indeed, combinations of diagnostic imaging methods, especially CT imaging, could represent a surrogate of more severe diseases and the severity of LBP is a known factor affecting imaging rates and prescribed medication patterns. In fact, patients with a CT were older on average and had more comorbidities compared to the remaining patients.

### Low back pain in the emergency department-are the ACR appropriateness criteria being followed? [^113zT5Av]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the prevalence of appropriate imaging among emergency department (ED) patients with low back pain.

Methods

Our level-1 ED records were retrospectively searched for patients with a chief compliant of "low back pain" from January to April 2013. Of 624 patients, 100 were randomly selected and analyzed for their demographics, presentation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes. The study indication for imaging was compared with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and the indication was deemed appropriate if it received a rating of ≥ 5.

Results

The mean age of the study population was 48 years (50% women, 50% men). The majority presented with acute or acute on chronic low back pain (94 patients), and half had a precipitating event (50 patients). A total of 28 (28%) patients underwent imaging in the ED; 24 (24%) had outpatient imaging; 54 (54%) had neither ED nor outpatient imaging. In all, 96% (27 of 28) of patients imaged in the ED, and 96% (23 of 24) imaged as outpatients, were appropriately imaged. Of patients who did not undergo imaging, 96% (52 of 54) were appropriately not imaged. A total of 76 patients (76%) had follow-up after discharge: of these, 42 (55%) had resolution or return of pain to baseline with conservative management; 18 (24%) had improvement with intervention (epidural steroid injection or kyphoplasty); 8 (10%) improved with surgery; and 8 had persistent pain (11%).

Conclusions

The majority of patients presenting to the ED with low back pain did not undergo imaging. The vast majority of those who underwent imaging were appropriately imaged, based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute back pain in the emergency department [^117BAync]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. The key to proper evaluation is a history and physical examination focused on determining if any red flags for serious disease are present. If no red flags are present, the patient most likely has nonspecific back pain and their symptoms will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. No diagnostic testing is required. For patients with red flags, a focused history and examination in conjunction with diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging determine whether the patient has an emergent condition such as herniated disc, epidural compression, or spinal infection.

### Non-specific low back pain [^115NutWU]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain that are caused by medically serious pathology, and so require diagnostic work-up or specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable, thus many patients require little if any formal medical care. Two treatment strategies are currently used, a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that is progressed if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Appropriate use of diagnostic imaging in low back pain: a reminder that unnecessary imaging may do as much harm as good [^112kSXKv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The rate of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging in the United States is growing at an alarming rate, despite evidence that it is not accompanied by improved patient outcomes. Overutilization of lumbar imaging in individuals with low back pain correlates with, and likely contributes to, a 2- to 3-fold increase in surgical rates over the last 10 years. Furthermore, a patient's knowledge of imaging abnormalities can actually decrease self-perception of health and may lead to fear-avoidance and catastrophizing behaviors that may predispose people to chronicity. The purpose of this clinical commentary is as follows: (1) to describe an outline of the appropriate use, as defined in recent guidelines, of diagnostic imaging in patients with low back pain; (2) to describe how inappropriate use of lumbar spine imaging can increase the risk of patient harm and contributes to the recent large increases in healthcare costs; (3) to provide physical therapists with clear guidelines to educate patients on both appropriate imaging and information to dampen the potential negative effects of imaging on patients' perceptions and health; and (4) to present an example of a successful clinical pathway that has reduced imaging and improved outcomes.

For research, it states that intuitively diagnostic imaging would not be expected to provide a positive cost-utility for influencing physical treatment, pain reduction, or functional improvement in patients with low back pain, and "the work group recommends prospective studies evaluating implementation of patient education programs regarding the utility of imaging in order to align patient expectations with imaging utility, improve patient satisfaction and reduce cost".

Acute low back pain, defined as less than 6 weeks in duration, does not require imaging in the absence of "red flags" that may indicate a cause, such as fracture, infection, or malignancy. When imaging is indicated, it is important to rule out a host of abnormalities that may be responsible for the pain and any associated symptoms. A common mnemonic VINDICATE can help ensure a thorough consideration of the possible causes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® back pain-child: 2024 update [^111ikCPa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic back pain is a common chief complaint encountered in the pediatric population. Although there are many etiologies for pediatric back pain, most cases are attributable to benign mechanical causes. Serious conditions causing back pain such as inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies are much less common but these pathologies can lead to long-term morbidity. Recent paradigm shift to judicious use of diagnostic imaging resources has come to the forefront. Although imaging is unlikely to be beneficial in transient back pain without neurologic deficit and normal physical examination, prompt imaging evaluation is required when there are clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology. For this document, various clinical scenarios are discussed by which a child may present with back pain. Imaging studies that might be most appropriate (based on the best available evidence or expert consensus) in these clinical scenarios are detailed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### X-ray… [^116scxd3]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

An X-ray is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays. Roughly, X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 10 nanometers to 10 picometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range of 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz and photon energies in the range of 100 eV to 100 keV, respectively. X-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, so X-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics and materials science. However X-rays are ionizing radiation and exposure can be hazardous to health, causing DNA damage, cancer and, at higher intensities, burns and radiation sickness.

Their generation and use is strictly controlled by public health authorities. In 1901, U. S. President William McKinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt while attending the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found. A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but was not used. While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later. Hazards discovered With the widespread experimentation with X‑rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time.

In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dudley was X-rayed. In August 1896, H. D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an X-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with X-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all. On 3 August 1905, in San Francisco, California, Elizabeth Fleischman, an American X-ray pioneer, died from complications as a result of her work with X-rays.

Hall-Edwards developed a cancer sufficiently advanced by 1904 to cause him to write papers and give public addresses on the dangers of X-rays. His left arm had to be amputated at the elbow in 1908, and four fingers on his right arm soon thereafter, leaving only a thumb. He died of cancer in 1926. His left hand is kept at Birmingham University. A typical early 20th-century medical X-ray system consisted of a Ruhmkorff coil connected to a cold cathode Crookes X-ray tube. A spark gap was typically connected to the high voltage side in parallel to the tube and used for diagnostic purposes. The spark gap allowed detecting the polarity of the sparks, measuring voltage by the length of the sparks thus determining the "hardness" of the vacuum of the tube, and it provided a load in the event the X-ray tube was disconnected. To detect the hardness of the tube, the spark gap was initially opened to the widest setting.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^1172qyrP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Imaging of back pain in children [^111kjrNw]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

While back pain presents less frequently in children than in adults, it still poses a significant clinical challenge with respect to making a firm diagnosis and developing an effective treatment plan. When children have back pain and medical attention is sought, an underlying pathology is usually suspected. Pediatric patients are evaluated, first, with a complete clinical history and examination and, second, by an imaging work-up that is based on initial findings, including the child's age and size, signs and symptoms, and suspected etiology. This article describes 1) the epidemiology of back pain in children, 2) the imaging work-up used, and 3) the correlation of imaging findings with disease entities that may cause back pain in the pediatric patient. The list of diseases giving rise to back pain is not meant to be exhaustive but rather reflective of the most commonly identified pathologies and disorders among young children and adolescents, from athletic injuries to lethal cancers.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Rapid magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing cancer-related low back pain [^1178yFVu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study compared the relative efficiency of lumbar x-ray and rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnosing cancer-related low back pain (LBP) in primary care patients.

Design

We developed a decision model with Markov state transitions to calculate the cost per case detected and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of rapid MR imaging. Model parameters were estimated from the medical literature. The costs of x-ray and rapid MR were calculated in an activity-based costing study.

Setting and Patients

A hypothetical cohort of primary care patients with LBP referred for imaging to exclude cancer as the cause of their pain.

Main Results

The rapid MR strategy was more expensive due to higher initial imaging costs and larger numbers of patients requiring conventional MR and biopsy. The overall sensitivity of the rapid MR strategy was higher than that of the x-ray strategy (62% vs 55%). However, because of low pre-imaging prevalence of cancer-related LBP, this generates < 1 extra case per 1,000 patients imaged. Therefore, the incremental cost per case detected using rapid MR was high ($213,927). The rapid MR strategy resulted in a small increase in quality-adjusted survival (0.00043 QALYs). The estimated incremental cost per QALY for the rapid MR strategy was $296,176.

Conclusions

There is currently not enough evidence to support the routine use of rapid MR to detect cancer as a cause of LBP in primary care patients.

### The Lancet series call to action to reduce low value care for low back pain: an update [^115rbaV9]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

4. Much of the money spent on low back pain is wasted, and better system level and policy solutions are needed

Not enough is yet being done on a global scale to address the rising burden of low back pain. The impact and burden of noncommunicable diseases now far outweigh that of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional in most countries. Yet, when describing integrated strategies for prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases, only half of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states mention musculoskeletal health and low back pain, despite those being the most burdensome noncommunicable diseases.

The Lancet Series identified promising solutions that included focused implementation of best practice, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health and occupational care, changes to payment systems and legislation, and public health and prevention strategies. Yet, we also indicated that most were not yet ready for widespread implementation as the evidence underpinning them was inadequate.

Targeted efforts to reduce overuse of imaging for low back pain, a major source of healthcare waste and even iatrogenesis, have not met with much success to date. Lowering imaging rates is challenging, and strategies must be targeted towards the population/patients, clinicians, and health care administrators. Patients request imaging expecting to obtain a diagnosis for their pain; clinicians order imaging because of entrenched beliefs and habits, perceived pressure from patients, fear of litigation and financial incentives; and health systems continue to offer liberal access to imaging probably because of public demand and pressure from clinicians.

Global initiatives to decrease health care waste and iatrogenesis such as Choosing Wisely are therefore specifically targeting imaging for low back pain; however, large-scale impact of these initiatives have not yet been well documented. A 2019 times-series analysis of a national strategy designed to reduce general practitioner requests for X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans that was implemented by the Australian National Prescribing Service in 2013 reported a 11% relative reduction in lumbar spine CT scans over that year, equating to a cost reduction to the government of AUD$11,600,898. Based upon an estimated cost of the program which was delivered to almost 20,000 general practitioners (60% of all registered general practitioners in Australia), the program cost $AUD2.82 per CT scan averted. No effects on X-ray requests were observed, and it is not known whether or not there was any substitution of CT scans by medical specialist referral for magnetic resonance imaging.

### Red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in people presenting with low back pain [^114oCWXB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common presentation across different healthcare settings. Clinicians need to confidently be able to screen and identify people presenting with low back pain with a high suspicion of serious or specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture). Patients identified with an increased likelihood of having a serious pathology will likely require additional investigations and specific treatment. Guidelines recommend a thorough history and clinical assessment to screen for serious pathology as a cause of low back pain. However, the diagnostic accuracy of recommended red flags (e.g. older age, trauma, corticosteroid use) remains unclear, particularly those used to screen for vertebral fracture.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of red flags used to screen for vertebral fracture in people presenting with low back pain. Where possible, we reported results of red flags separately for different types of vertebral fracture (i.e. acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, vertebral traumatic fracture, vertebral stress fracture, unspecified vertebral fracture).

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 July 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered primary diagnostic studies if they compared results of history taking or physical examination (or both) findings (index test) with a reference standard test (e.g. X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT)) for the identification of vertebral fracture in people presenting with low back pain. We included index tests that were presented individually or as part of a combination of tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data for diagnostic two-by-two tables from the publications or reconstructed them using information from relevant parameters to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We extracted aspects of study design, characteristics of the population, index test, reference standard, and type of vertebral fracture. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of studies and index tests, therefore the analysis was descriptive. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for each test and used these as an indication of clinical usefulness. Two review authors independently conducted risk of bias and applicability assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool.

Main Results

This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review of red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in people with low back pain. We included 14 studies in this review, six based in primary care, five in secondary care, and three in tertiary care. Four studies reported on 'osteoporotic vertebral fractures', two studies reported on 'vertebral compression fracture', one study reported on 'osteoporotic and traumatic vertebral fracture', two studies reported on 'vertebral stress fracture', and five studies reported on 'unspecified vertebral fracture'. Risk of bias was only rated as low in one study for the domains reference standard and flow and timing. The domain patient selection had three studies and the domain index test had six studies rated at low risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data. Results from single studies suggest only a small number of the red flags investigated may be informative. In the primary healthcare setting, results from single studies suggest 'trauma' demonstrated informative +LRs (range: 1.93 to 12.85) for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' and 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture' (+LR: 6.42, 95% CI 2.94 to 14.02). Results from single studies suggest 'older age' demonstrated informative +LRs for studies in primary care for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' (older age greater than 70 years: 11.19, 95% CI 5.33 to 23.51). Results from single studies suggest 'corticosteroid use' may be an informative red flag in primary care for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' (+LR range: 3.97, 95% CI 0.20 to 79.15 to 48.50, 95% CI 11.48 to 204.98) and 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture' (+LR: 2.46, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.34); however, diagnostic values varied and CIs were imprecise. Results from a single study suggest red flags as part of a combination of index tests such as 'older age and female gender' in primary care demonstrated informative +LRs for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' (16.17, 95% CI 4.47 to 58.43). In the secondary healthcare setting, results from a single study suggest 'trauma' demonstrated informative +LRs for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' (+LR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.54) and 'older age' demonstrated informative +LRs for 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture' (older age greater than 75 years: 2.51, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.27). Results from a single study suggest red flags as part of a combination of index tests such as 'older age and trauma' in secondary care demonstrated informative +LRs for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' (+LR: 4.35, 95% CI 2.92 to 6.48). Results from a single study suggest when '4 of 5 tests' were positive in secondary care, they demonstrated informative +LRs for 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture' (+LR: 9.62, 95% CI 5.88 to 15.73). In the tertiary care setting, results from a single study suggest 'presence of contusion/abrasion' was informative for 'vertebral compression fracture' (+LR: 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that only a few red flags are potentially useful in guiding clinical decisions to further investigate people suspected to have a vertebral fracture. Most red flags were not useful as screening tools to identify vertebral fracture in people with low back pain. In primary care, 'older age' was informative for 'unspecified vertebral fracture', and 'trauma' and 'corticosteroid use' were both informative for 'unspecified vertebral fracture' and 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture'. In secondary care, 'older age' was informative for 'osteoporotic vertebral fracture' and 'trauma' was informative for 'unspecified vertebral fracture'. In tertiary care, 'presence of contusion/abrasion' was informative for 'vertebral compression fracture'. Combinations of red flags were also informative and may be more useful than individual tests alone. Unfortunately, the challenge to provide clear guidance on which red flags should be used routinely in clinical practice remains. Further research with primary studies is needed to improve and consolidate our current recommendations for screening for vertebral fractures to guide clinical care.

Discussion

Each recommendation is discussed separately below.
Patients with PSPS-T1 should undergo a wide range of imaging and physical assessments in a timely manner to guide treatment decisions. Imaging options include a combination of MRI and full spine X-ray, which can be used to determine the suitability of treatment (eg, spine surgery or SCS) (Figure 3).

A thorough history of the disease and a physical examination should be performed to assess symptoms and signs of underlying serious and dangerous conditions. Additionally, patients should undergo a comprehensive behavioral assessment and be evaluated for the presence of psychological risk factors. This evaluation can guide future treatment decisions, as psychiatric disorders are considered absolute contraindications for SCS.

Imaging is a crucial aspect of the diagnostic process, as it may help identify the cause of pain and guide treatment decisions and approaches. Several imaging modalities are available to support the diagnosis of CLBP.

X-rays evaluate the local or global spinal alignment, osteophytes, and surgical hardware placement, with parameters like pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis playing a critical role in identifying alignment issues (S19, 81%). MRI provides visualization of soft tissues, such as discs and nerve roots, and helps identify causes like stenosis. Recently, a high-resolution 3D quantitative synthetic CT (sCT) method has become commercially available (BoneMRI v1.8, MRIguidance BV, NL) after FDA and CE approval, converting MRI into sCT images mimicking CT images.

Although a number of additional diagnostic modalities, such as CT-scan (when BoneMRI is not available), including SPECT-CT and CT myelography, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and epidurography, are commonly used in clinical practice, our results indicate agreement that combining imaging modalities, such as (full-spine) X-ray and MRI, can further enhance diagnostic precision.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department that leads to a great deal of resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is long and most cases are caused by benign pathology that will resolve on its own. Imaging is over-used and rarely helps. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination that will help physicians better identify the small of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, will result in significant neurological damage.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® inflammatory back pain: known or suspected axial spondyloarthritis: 2021 update [^115H7RBV]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory back pain is a hallmark feature of axial spondyloarthritis, a heterogeneous group of inflammatory disorders which affects the sacroiliac joints and spine. Imaging plays a key role in diagnosis of this disease and in facilitating appropriate treatment. This document provides evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate use of imaging studies during multiple stages of the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected or known axial spondyloarthritis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Imaging the back pain patient [^113KmxVZ]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc. Imaging findings of the structural changes of osteoarthritis do not correlate with pain production. Physiologic imaging, either with single-photon emission CT bone scan, heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences (short-tau inversion recovery), or gadolinium enhancement, can detect inflammation and are more predictive of an axial pain generator.

### Treatment patterns in patients with diagnostic imaging for low back pain: a retrospective observational study [^116Pt6Th]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common complaints of the general populationand a frequent reason for medical consultations. Most international guidelines recommend pain medication therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, only if necessary, opioids. However, a large evidence-performance gap can be observed in clinical practice regarding guideline-compliance. Of particular interest is treatment with opioids. Their generous use can easily lead to addiction and thus become a major public health problem, as can currently be observed in the USA. The monitoring of treatment quality and treatment patterns is imperative to all stakeholders involved in the maintenance and promotion of high quality of care. Studies determining treatment patterns specific to patients with diagnostic imaging of the spine are lacking. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine and characterize treatment patterns, including pain medication therapies and non-pharmacologic therapies (NPT), in patients who had undergone diagnostic imaging for LBP. First, we sought the proportion of patients receiving specific classes of pain medication depending on the time of diagnostic imaging. We then examined associations between prescriptions and diagnostic imaging methods. In addition, we investigated the effect of the most commonly used NPT on pain medication treatment.

ASIPP continued therapy after biologic interventions — repeat injections may be required, depending on the patient's response, which may depend on factors including pathology, biologic type/quality, baseline health status, and injection technique. Frequent repeat imaging is not recommended unless there has been a change in patient symptoms or pathology; however, obtaining an x-ray to determine improvement in a joint space or obtaining an MRI scan to identify changes in soft tissue structures including articular cartilage may be considered necessary.

Barriers to change

Lack of awareness of current back pain guidelines and knowledge about how to apply them in practice are likely contributors to the over-reliance on imaging in primary care. This is often exacerbated if institutional policies and practices around imaging are not aligned to the latest evidence. Recent systematic reviews suggest that the clinical environment itself may encourage physicians to over-order imaging due to (a) accommodating patient requests, (b) believing that imaging will reassure the patient, and (c) not having time to explain and justify a non-imaging approach. Reported less consistently in the literature, additional factors include worry about missing a specific pathology, not being aware of conservative interventions besides medication, and a lack of access to conservative management such as exercise therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive behavioural therapy, and pain management programmes.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^111MDypC]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition in the USA, with approximately 80% of adults who will have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffering from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the USA, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for non-specific LBP receive X-rays and other imaging studies. However, for most acute LBP patients, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without contributing to patient outcomes. The specific aim of the quality improvement (QI) project was to determine the effect of a multicomponent intervention to enhance the appropriate imaging utilisation for acute LBP to ≥ 90%. During the first 6 months of the QI project, 191 patients with LBP were seen. Of those patients, 156 (81.7%) received appropriate imaging over the 6-month intervention period, missing our targeted goal. Furthermore, this rate declined to baseline values after termination of the intervention, suggesting the need for additional prompts to sustain the initial intervention effect. Following a health system-wide deployment of practice-based alerts and quality score cards, the appropriate utilisation rate increased again and quickly to the target rate of 90%. To reduce variability in our clinical practice and to sustain an appropriate utilisation rate will require continued work. Health systems must find efficient methods to reduce LBP imaging and increase appropriate management of non-specific LBP in primary care. Increasing concordance with imaging guidelines can lessen harm associated with unnecessary radiation exposure and result in significant cost savings.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^114PauU8]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Problem

Low back pain (LBP) is a common reason for physician visits in the ambulatory care setting. In the initial release of the Choosing Wisely campaign, routine imaging for acute LBP was among the most prominent low-value services cited to avoid because of its relatively high out-of-pocket expense and large volume of physician visits nationally. Although routine use of imaging for non-specific LBP is not recommended by a number of clinical specialty societies, many physicians continue to order imaging without a clear clinical indication.

At our academic institution, we found that our current rate of appropriate utilisation was not optimal. In response, the primary objective of our mixed-method quality improvement (QI) project was to assess the impact of a multicomponent, clinical decision support (CDS)-enabled intervention designed to increase appropriate utilisation in clinical care and to identify patient expectations and educational needs.

### How common is imaging for low back pain in primary and emergency care? Systematic review and meta-analysis of over 4 million imaging requests across 21 years [^111o9SBv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To (1) estimate the proportion of patients seeking care for low back pain (LBP) who are imaged and (2) explore trends in the proportion of patients who received diagnostic imaging over time. We also examined the effect of study-level factors on estimates of imaging proportion.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases from January 1995 to December 2017.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Observational designs and controlled trials that reported imaging for patients presenting to primary care or emergency care for LBP. We assessed study quality and calculated pooled proportions by care setting and imaging type, with strength of evidence assessed using the GRADE system.

Results

45 studies were included. They represented 19 451 749 consultations for LBP that had resulted in 4 343 919 imaging requests/events over 21 years. Primary care: moderate quality evidence that simple imaging proportion was 16.3% (95% CI 12.6% to 21.1%) and complex imaging was 9.2% (95% CI 6.2% to 13.5%). For any imaging, the pooled proportion was 24.8% (95% CI 19.3%to 31.1%). Emergency care: moderate quality evidence that simple imaging proportion was 26.1% (95% CI 18.2% to 35.8%) and high-quality evidence that complex imaging proportion was 8.2% (95% CI 4.4% to 15.6%). For any imaging, the pooled proportion was 35.6% (95%CI 29.8% to 41.8%). Complex imaging increased from 7.4% (95% CI 5.7% to 9.6%) for imaging requested in 1995 to 11.4% (95% CI 9.6% to 13.5%) in 2015 (relative increase of 53.5%). Between-study variability in imaging proportions was only partially explained by study-level characteristics; there were insufficient data to comment on some prespecified study-level factors.

Summary/Conclusion

One in four patients who presented to primary care with LBP received imaging as did one in three who presented to the emergency department. The rate of complex imaging appears to have increased over 21 years despite guideline advice and education campaigns.
