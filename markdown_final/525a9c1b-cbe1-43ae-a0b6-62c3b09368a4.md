## Question

What would cause predominantly a diastolic hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes predominantly diastolic hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and thresholds across guidelines. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic determinants of diastolic blood pressure and how they differ from systolic drivers. Next, I will examine age- and sex-specific mechanisms, followed by secondary causes that preferentially raise diastolic pressure. After that, I should review lifestyle and environmental contributors, and finally synthesize a coherent causal model and consider clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I double-check areas of controversy along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on the wrong construct. Predominantly isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) is typically defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mmHg by 2018 ESC/ESH criteria, whereas the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline lowers the DBP threshold to ≥ 80 mmHg with SBP < 130 mmHg, which expands the IDH phenotype substantially; I should keep both frameworks in mind because they influence prevalence and risk attribution [^113x4Vh2] [^115mtmxK].

> Now, I need to check the hemodynamic basis. Diastolic pressure is largely a function of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the elastic recoil of arteries during diastole, whereas systolic pressure is more sensitive to stroke volume, cardiac output, and large artery stiffness; therefore, a predominant rise in DBP generally signals increased SVR or heightened sympathetic tone with vasoconstriction, often with relatively preserved arterial compliance early in the disease process [^113huW2q] [^1139yAqv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single mechanism fitting all. I will now examine age-related patterns: in younger adults, IDH is relatively more common and often reflects a hyperdynamic state with higher heart rate and cardiac index but lower stroke volume, whereas in older adults arterial stiffening predominates, pushing SBP upward and DBP downward; importantly, midlife diastolic hypertension tracks with future arterial stiffness, suggesting that persistent elevation of DBP accelerates vascular remodeling over time [^111hTgzK] [^1139yAqv] [^111TmSQX].

> Wait, let me verify sex-related differences so I don't overgeneralize. Young females more often exhibit a vascular phenotype with increased peripheral resistance and higher prevalence of systolic-diastolic or isolated diastolic hypertension, whereas young males more often show a cardiac-output–driven isolated systolic pattern; these mechanistic distinctions may influence how we interpret and treat IDH in different populations [^111hTgzK] [^1144z1EM].

> Next, I should review secondary causes that can selectively elevate DBP. Hyperadrenergic states, obstructive sleep apnea, and primary aldosteronism can all raise SVR and DBP; notably, recent hemodynamic work suggests that predominantly diastolic hypertension can feature hyperdynamic circulation with higher heart rate and cardiac index, so I need to ensure I screen for sympathetic overactivity and endocrine drivers when the phenotype is discordant with simple "increased resistance" models [^1139yAqv] [^116anV9b].

> I need to ensure I consider lifestyle and environmental contributors that modulate SVR and autonomic tone. Excess sodium intake, physical inactivity, overweight/obesity, and psychosocial stress increase sympathetic activity and peripheral resistance, thereby favoring higher DBP; smoking and alcohol also acutely raise SVR and catecholamines, which can manifest as diastolic hypertension in susceptible individuals [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a causal model, but I should double-check that it aligns with observed phenotypes. In younger or metabolically active individuals, sympathetic activation and increased SVR predominate, producing IDH; over time, sustained DBP elevation promotes medial hypertrophy and fibrosis, increasing arterial stiffness and shifting the phenotype toward combined or isolated systolic hypertension in later life, which explains the age-related decline in IDH prevalence and the rise of ISH with aging [^111TmSQX] [^113Vn6Gy] [^115xga8Q].

> But wait, what about clinical significance and detection pitfalls. IDH is frequently underrecognized in practice, and its risk appears heterogeneous: some large cohorts show no independent risk using ACC/AHA thresholds and ambulatory criteria, whereas others demonstrate modestly increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in younger individuals; this heterogeneity argues for careful phenotyping with out-of-office measurements and attention to global risk rather than treating DBP in isolation [^111oXnv6] [^113Qarhe] [^115mtmxK].

> I should confirm guideline-directed evaluation so I don't miss modifiable drivers. For patients with IDH, obtain periodic out-of-office BP (home or ambulatory) to confirm persistence, implement lifestyle interventions universally, and screen for secondary causes when indicated by age of onset, severity, hypokalemia, or refractory hypertension; if drug therapy is pursued, follow general BP-lowering strategies rather than a DBP-specific algorithm, recognizing that evidence for IDH-specific pharmacologic benefit remains limited compared with systolic-driven phenotypes [^111zC6Wn] [^114PU99X] [^113wmc8Y].

> In summary, predominantly diastolic hypertension reflects increased systemic vascular resistance and sympathetic tone, with contributions from hyperdynamic circulation in some younger patients, and it often represents an earlier vascular phenotype that may evolve with aging into systolic-predominant hypertension; careful identification, risk stratification, and targeted lifestyle and secondary-cause evaluation are essential, while acknowledging that the strength of outcome data and treatment evidence for IDH is less consistent than for isolated systolic hypertension [^113huW2q] [^1139yAqv] [^111TmSQX].

Predominantly diastolic hypertension is driven by **increased peripheral vascular resistance** [^113huW2q] and **heightened sympathetic activity** [^1139yAqv], especially in younger or middle-aged adults [^111hTgzK]. Key contributors include obesity, insulin resistance, high sodium intake, physical inactivity, and stress [^notfound]; secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, and obstructive sleep apnea also raise diastolic pressure [^113wmc8Y]. Unlike isolated systolic hypertension, it is **not primarily due to arterial stiffness** [^111hTgzK] [^1139yAqv]. Management focuses on lifestyle change, weight loss, sodium reduction, and agents that lower peripheral resistance (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics) [^notfound].

---

## Hemodynamic mechanisms

- **Increased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR)**: The primary driver of elevated diastolic pressure, reflecting heightened vascular tone and reduced arterial compliance [^111hTgzK] [^1139yAqv].

- **Sympathetic nervous system activation**: Elevated sympathetic tone increases vascular resistance and diastolic pressure, particularly in younger adults [^notfound].

- **Hyperdynamic circulation**: Higher cardiac output and heart rate with lower stroke volume characterize predominantly diastolic hypertension, distinguishing it from systolic hypertension [^1158y8Ve] [^116anV9b].

---

## Lifestyle and environmental factors

- **Obesity and insulin resistance**: Strongly associated with increased PVR and diastolic hypertension, particularly in younger populations [^111hTgzK].

- **High sodium intake**: Excess sodium exacerbates vascular resistance and diastolic pressure [^notfound].

- **Physical inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyle contributes to increased vascular resistance and diastolic hypertension [^notfound].

- **Stress and anxiety**: Chronic stress elevates sympathetic activity, increasing diastolic pressure [^notfound].

---

## Secondary causes

- **Primary aldosteronism**: Excess aldosterone increases sodium retention and vascular resistance, raising diastolic pressure [^notfound].

- **Pheochromocytoma**: Catecholamine excess causes profound vasoconstriction and elevated diastolic pressure [^notfound].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic surges increase vascular resistance and diastolic pressure [^notfound].

---

## Age and sex differences

Younger adults more often exhibit **isolated diastolic hypertension** due to increased PVR and sympathetic activity [^111hTgzK] [^1139yAqv], whereas older adults more commonly develop isolated systolic hypertension from arterial stiffness [^111hTgzK] [^115xga8Q]. Men have a higher prevalence of diastolic hypertension than women, particularly at younger ages [^115aPZkt].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, sodium restriction, increased physical activity, and stress management are foundational [^notfound].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics effectively reduce PVR and diastolic pressure [^notfound].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regular blood pressure monitoring and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors are essential [^111zC6Wn].

---

Predominantly diastolic hypertension reflects increased peripheral resistance and sympathetic tone, shaped by lifestyle and secondary causes; **targeted therapy and risk-factor modification** are key to management [^111hTgzK] [^114adVXr].

### What is the most important component of blood pressure: systolic, diastolic or pulse pressure? [^115YhabH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diastolic blood pressure has traditionally been considered the most important component of blood pressure and the primary target of antihypertensive therapy. However, over 30 years ago important epidemiological studies pointed out the importance of systolic blood pressure, and research during the 1990s has strengthened this view. Unlike diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure increases progressively with age, and in the ageing societies elevated systolic pressure is the most common form of hypertension. The characteristic changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age lead to increases in pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which has emerged as a new, potentially independent risk factor. In this review we compare the relative importance of various blood pressure components.

Recent Findings

Generally, in studies in which readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been compared, systolic blood pressure has been a better predictor of risk. Moreover, isolated systolic hypertension predicts risk better than isolated diastolic hypertension, and the treatment of both isolated systolic hypertension and combined hypertension has reduced cardiovascular events. There are no treatment studies of isolated diastolic hypertension. Pulse pressure reflects stiffening of large arteries and is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Pulse pressure also predicts events in epidemiologic studies, but elucidation of an independent role is hampered by the close correlation between pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.

Summary

Epidemiological and treatment studies suggest that systolic blood pressure should be the primary target of antihypertensive therapy, although consideration of systolic and diastolic pressure together improves risk prediction. The greatest practical concern at the moment is the undertreatment of hypertension, especially systolic, and total cardiovascular risk.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease: controversies in hypertension-pro side of the argument [^112nQ9cC]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), defined as diastolic blood pressure in the hypertensive range but systolic blood pressure not in the hypertensive range, is not uncommon (< 20%) among adults with hypertension. IDH often manifests in concurrence with other cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with IDH tend to have lower awareness of their hypertension compared with those with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. IDH appears to be a largely underrated risk factor for cardiovascular disease events, which may be explained by inconsistent association of IDH with cardiovascular disease events. The inconsistency suggests that IDH is heterogeneous. One size does not seem to fit all in the clinical management of individuals with IDH. Rather than treating IDH as a monolithic low-risk condition, detailed phenotyping in the context of individual comprehensive cardiovascular risk would seem to be most useful to assess an individual's expected net benefit from therapy. In this review, we highlight that the clinical relevance of IDH differs by individual clinical characteristics, and elucidate groups of individuals with IDH that should be wary of cardiovascular disease risks.

### Hyperdynamic circulation distinguishes predominantly diastolic hypertension from predominantly systolic hypertension [^1139yAqv]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disorder worldwide, while cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. The pathophysiology of primary hypertension is multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Together, these factors influence cardiovascular regulatory systems, leading to chronically elevated blood pressure (BP) and an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity.

The primary hemodynamic determinants of BP are cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Additionally, large arterial stiffness plays a key role in determining systolic BP and pulse pressure. Traditionally, hypertension is classified into systolic-diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, and isolated diastolic hypertension. The hemodynamic profiles underlying these phenotypes are often simplified as follows: isolated systolic hypertension is associated with increased large arterial stiffness and elevated cardiac output, whereas isolated diastolic hypertension is linked to high systemic vascular resistance. However, recent findings from a large cohort study of 33,414 participants suggest that these phenotypes exhibit heterogeneous hemodynamic profiles. Overall, various combinations of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance can contribute to elevated BP across all hypertensive categories.

We have previously used the orthostatic challenge to assess the functional hemodynamics of hypertension. Postural changes alter autonomic nervous tone, systemic vascular resistance, and overall hemodynamics. Although BP is conventionally measured in the seated or supine position, daily human activities primarily occur in the upright position. Additionally, BP hyperreactivity to standing has been reported to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.

Assessing the hemodynamic patterns underlying hypertension phenotypes may have future clinical implications, such as aiding in the personalization of treatment strategies. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic patterns of predominantly systolic hypertension (PSH) and predominantly diastolic hypertension (PDH) by evaluating hemodynamic variables during passive head-up tilt (HUT).

### Association of isolated diastolic hypertension based on the cutoff value in the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines with subsequent cardiovascular events in the general population [^113yTiMa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 1, 2, 3 and is diagnosed based on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for hypertension lowered the threshold of blood pressure (BP) from 140/90 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. 4 However, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension retained the cutoff value of BP for hypertension at 140/90 mm Hg. 5 Although several studies confirmed the validity of the updated ACC/AHA classification of BP, 6, 7 lowering the threshold of diastolic BP to 80 mm Hg was based on expert opinion. 8 Further, there have been conflicting data regarding the influence of DBP on subsequent cardiovascular events. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Particularly, McEvoy et al 9 recently indicated that isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) according to the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines suggested was not significantly associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Therefore, the cutoff value of DBP in the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines is still under debate, and further investigation is warranted to verify the validity of these guidelines. In this study, we sought to explore the association of IDH based on the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines indicated with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events among the general population without a prevalent history of CVD using a nationwide epidemiological database.

### Underdiagnosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension [^111oXnv6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systolic and diastolic hypertension independently predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains unclear how systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and other patient characteristics influence the initial diagnosis of hypertension. Here, we use a cohort of 146,816 adults in a large healthcare system to examine how elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements influence initial diagnosis of hypertension and how other patient characteristics influence the diagnosis. Thirty-four percent of the cohort were diagnosed with hypertension within 1 year. In multivariable logistic regression of the diagnosis of hypertension, controlling for covariates, isolated systolic hypertensive measures (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.41 to 0.43]) and isolated diastolic hypertensive measures (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.33]) were less likely to lead to hypertension diagnosis when compared with combined hypertensive measures. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure had a greater impact on hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.75 to 1.79] per Z-score) than did higher levels of diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.32 to 1.36] per Z-score). Older age, non-white race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities all predicted the establishment of a diagnosis of hypertension. Isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension are underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and several patient-centered factors also strongly influence whether a diagnosis is made. In conclusion, our findings uncover a care gap that can be closed with increased attention to the independent influence of systolic and diastolic hypertension and the various patient-centered factors that may impact hypertension diagnosis.

### Choice of antihypertensive agent in isolated systolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension: a secondary analysis of the ALLHAT trial [^112sGE33]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite broad treatment recommendations, there are limited published reports comparing the efficacy of different antihypertensive agents in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension. This study was a secondary analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial. We compared the use of chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril on the primary outcome of combined coronary heart disease, stroke, or all-cause mortality in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension.

### Epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical significance of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure [^114tJ9nw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Long-term population surveys and studies of untreated hypertensive patients both strongly suggest that over the age of about 45, the height of the systolic blood pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than the diastolic pressure. Research into echocardiographic left ventricular size, endothelial function and thromborheology also back up this supposition. In clinical practice, the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension has been shown to be very worthwhile. There remains some uncertainty as to the relative significance of diastolic blood pressure when it is frankly high, as in severe systo-diastolic hypertension. However some clinicians and epidemiologists have questioned whether diastolic pressure is still worth measuring, given the overwhelming importance of the height of the systolic blood pressure at predicting outcome.

### Cardiovascular risk of isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension in young adults [^1132b3yc]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding health outcomes associated with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), or systolic and diastolic hypertension (SDH) among young adults with stage 1 hypertension, defined using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure (BP) guideline.

Methods

From a nationwide health screening database, we included 6424090 participants, aged 20 to 39 years, who were not taking antihypertensive medication at the baseline examination in 2003 to 2007. Participants were categorized as having normal BP (untreated systolic BP [SBP] < 120/diastolic BP [DBP] < 80 mmHg; n = 2665310); elevated BP (SBP 120–129/DBP < 80 mmHg; n = 705344); stage 1 IDH (SBP < 130/DBP 80–89 mmHg; n = 1271505); stage 1 ISH (SBP 130–139/DBP < 80 mmHg; n = 255588); stage 1 SDH (SBP 130–139/DBP 80–89 mmHg; n = 711503); and stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 140, DBP ≥ 90 mmHg; n = 814840). The primary outcome was composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and CVD-related death.

Results

The median age of the participants was 30 years and 60.9% were male. Over a median follow-up of 13.2 years, 44070 new CVD events occurred. With normal BP as the reference, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for CVD events were 1.14 (1.09–1.18) for elevated BP, 1.32 (1.28–1.36) for stage 1 IDH, 1.36 (1.29–1.43) for stage 1 ISH, 1.67 (1.61–1.72) for stage 1 SDH, and 2.40 (2.33–2.47) for stage 2 hypertension.

Conclusions

Among young adults, stage 1 ISH, IDH, and SDH were all associated with higher CVD risks than normal BP. The CVD risks of stage 1 ISH and IDH were similar to each other but lower than the risk of stage 1 SDH. Categorizing young adults with stage 1 hypertension further into stage 1 ISH, IDH, and SDH may improve risk stratification for identifying high-risk individuals.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on major vascular events among patients with isolated diastolic hypertension: the perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) trial [^112Rk6si]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite clear evidence that blood pressure (BP) lowering is effective for prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension, there is ongoing uncertainty about its effects in those with isolated diastolic hypertension. The objective of the present analysis is to determine whether BP lowering provides benefits to patients with isolated diastolic hypertension.

Methods

Patients with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension at baseline (n = 4283) were randomly assigned to either active treatment (perindopril in all participants plus indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcome was total major vascular events.

Results

There were 1923 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg), 315 with isolated diastolic hypertension (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and 2045 with systolic-diastolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) at baseline. Active treatment reduced the relative risk of major vascular events by 27% (95% CI, 10% to 41%) among patients with isolated systolic hypertension, by 28% (-29% to 60%) among those with isolated diastolic hypertension, and by 32% (17% to 45%) among those with systolic-diastolic hypertension. There was no evidence of differences in the magnitude of the effects of treatment among different types of hypertension (P homogeneity = 0.89).

Conclusions

BP lowering is likely to provide a similar level of protection against major vascular events for patients with isolated diastolic hypertension as for those with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension. Clinical Trial Registration Information- This trial was not registered because patients were enrolled before July 1, 2005.

Conclusions

IDH based on the cutoff value of DBP in the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guidelines was associated with a higher risk of CVD in the general population without prevalent CVD, suggesting the potential clinical significance of IDH in the development of CVD.

### Treatment and blood pressure control in isolated systolic hypertension vs diastolic hypertension in primary care [^1121U9yB]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional surveys on prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension could not satisfactorily distinguish between diastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension because the definition of hypertension included patients under pharmacological treatment. We assessed the situation in the two types of hypertension in general practice in Belgium, based on current blood pressure (BP) measurements and on BP prior to the initiation of drug therapy. Participating physicians enrolled the first 15 at least 55-year-old men visiting the surgery, measured their BP and recorded data on medical history including pretreatment BP, drug utilization, cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage. Diastolic hypertension was defined as diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, irrespective of systolic BP, and isolated systolic hypertension as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg. Among 3761 evaluable patients, 74% were hypertensive. Among the 1533 hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure was known prior to treatment (n = 965) or who were untreated at the study visit (n = 568), 1164 had diastolic hypertension and 369 isolated systolic hypertension. The prevalence of antihypertensive treatment was, respectively, 75 and 25% (P < 0.001) in these two types of hypertension. The odds of being treated were independently determined by type of hypertension, severity of hypertension and level of risk (P < 0.001). BP was controlled in 25% of all patients with diastolic hypertension and in 13% of all patients with isolated systolic hypertension (P < 0.001). About half of the treated patients with systolic hypertension were on a diuretic and/or a calcium-channel blocker. In conclusion, isolated systolic hypertension is less frequently treated than diastolic hypertension, overall BP control is poor and actual drug therapy diverges from recommendations based on placebo-controlled intervention trials.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Participants With Isolated Diastolic Hypertension Compared With Normotensives and Other Hypertensives

The prevalence of IDH decreased with age, whereas the prevalence of other hypertension subtypes (including ISH, SDH and controlled hypertensives) increased with age (Figure 1). The prevalence of IDH was significantly higher for men (4.5% of overall population and 9.8% of hypertensives) as compared with women (2.2% of overall population and 5.2% of hypertensives; Table 2). The prevalence was also significantly higher among those living in rural areas and Western regions, who were at least college educated, and had a higher income (Table 2). Prevalence of IDH showed a similar distribution across different population subgroups in both treated and untreated hypertensive participants (Table 3 and Table S2).

The 1198 subgroups varied with respect to the prevalence of participants with IDH (median: 2.9%, [IQR: 1.7–4.7]; Figure S2). The prevalence of IDH was substantially higher in subgroups with participants who were younger, men, without prior cardiovascular event, and without DM as compared with participants who were older, women, with prior cardiovascular event, and with DM (Figure 2). Subgroups with at least 500 participants had similar results (Figures S3 and S4).

### Phenotypes of hypertension: impact of age and sex on hemodynamic mechanisms [^111hTgzK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Essential hypertension is often treated as a uniform condition. However, it encompasses distinct patterns of blood pressure elevation such as isolated systolic, systolic diastolic, and isolated diastolic hypertension, which vary in prevalence according to age and sex. We hypothesized that different hemodynamic mechanisms account for the age‐ and sex‐related differences in these hypertensive phenotypes.

Methods

In this cross‐sectional analysis of the ACCT (Anglo‐Cardiff Collaborative Trial), 5371 individuals (2402 male), aged 18 to 92 years, free of cardiovascular disease and medication were included. Blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured. Within each sex, subjects were stratified according to age (< 30, 30–60, and > 60 years), and blood pressure phenotype based on clinic (seated) blood pressure.

Results

Isolated systolic hypertension was the most common hypertensive phenotype in young men and characterized by an elevated cardiac output and stroke volume. In contrast, systolic diastolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension were more common in younger females, with systolic diastolic hypertension associated with elevated PVR and aortic pulse wave velocity, and isolated diastolic hypertension with increased PVR. Systolic diastolic hypertension was the most common phenotype in middle age and accompanied by increased PVR in both sexes. Isolated systolic hypertension was again the most common phenotype in older individuals. However, in contrast to younger adults, isolated systolic hypertension affected both men and women equally (~1:1) and was characterized by elevated aortic pulse wave velocity and PVR.

Conclusions

Different hypertensive phenotypes are characterized by distinct hemodynamic mechanisms in an age‐ and sex‐dependent manner. Targeting therapy toward primary hemodynamic abnormalities could lead to more effective interventions in essential hypertension.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension in the IDACO study: an age-stratified analysis using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements [^115xNKhx]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary Analyses on the Whole Study Population

Median follow-up was 13.8 years (5th–95th percentile interval, 2.5–25.1 years). During 153 140 person-years of follow-up, 2836 participants died (incidence rate of 18.5 per 1000 person-years) and 2049 experienced a composite cardiovascular event (13.4 per 1000 person-years), overall. When applying the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension criteria, crude incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) for death and cardiovascular events were 12.0 and 7.8 among normotensive participants, 9.7 and 8.4 among those with IDH, 34.1 and 26.3 among those with ISH, and 27.2 and 23.5 among participants with combined hypertension. Age and sex-standardized cumulative incidence curves, for both outcomes and among each BP category, are presented in the Figure. Using the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria for IDH, there was no statistically significant crude excess in either mortality or cardiovascular events relative to the normal BP category. However, IDH according to 2018 ESC criteria was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events (but not death). Irrespective of the guideline criteria applied, both ISH and combined systolic-diastolic hypertension were associated with an excess in death and cardiovascular events.

Relative to normotension, isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with increased risk of death or CV events when defined according to 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology criteria. The 24-h systolic/diastolic ambulatory blood pressure (BP) thresholds were 125/75 mm Hg by 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (A and B) and 130/80 mm Hg by 2018 European Society of Cardiology (C and D) definitions. Normotension refers to those with both systolic/diastolic BPs lower than the cutoff values, whereas combined hypertension refers to those with both systolic/diastolic BPs equal to or higher than the cutoff levels. Isolated systolic and diastolic hypertension refers to those with only systolic or diastolic BP elevated. Tabulated data are the number of participants at risk by hypertensive categories at 5-y intervals. P values show significance for comparison with the normotensive group.

Pathophysiology of hypertension in young adults

Although often viewed as a single condition, hypertension encompasses several distinct patterns of BP elevation such as isolated systolic (ISH), systolic diastolic (SDH) and isolated diastolic (IDH) hypertension, each with different underlying haemodynamic mechanisms. ISH is the most common form of hypertension in young adults. It is more common in males and those with a higher BMI. Elevated cardiac output, driven by an increased stroke volume, is the key underlying haemodynamic characteristic. A smaller number of young subjects with ISH have a normal stroke volume but increased aortic pulse wave velocity – a measure of aortic stiffness. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of the haemodynamics of primary hypertension in children and adults concluded that the main haemodynamic alteration in primary hypertension (including obesity-related hypertension), in both children and young to middle-aged adults, is an elevation of cardiac output.

SDH and IDH are the most common hypertensive phenotypes in young females, and are characterised by increased peripheral vascular resistance and, in some cases, elevated aortic stiffness. Cardiac output may also be raised, but because of high heart rate rather than an increased stroke volume.

Overall, these findings are consistent with the view that hypertensive young males display a predominantly 'cardiac' BP phenotype, whereas hypertensive young females have a predominantly 'vascular' BP phenotype. These differences may reflect divergent pathophysiology and may require alternate therapeutic approaches, but this remains to be tested formally in prospective research studies.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^112o8TaD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis of high or markedly low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with normalized on‐treatment systolic blood pressure on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) is uncertain. This study examined whether treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with MACEs in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A total of 7582 patients with on‐treatment systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) were categorized on the basis of average DBP: < 60 mm Hg (n = 1031; treated ILDBP), 60 to 79 mm Hg (n = 5432), ≥ 80 mm Hg (n = 1119; treated IDH). MACE risk was estimated using Cox proportional‐hazards models. Among the SPRINT participants, median age was 67.0 years and 64.9% were men. Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, 512 patients developed a MACE. The incidence of MACEs was 3.9 cases per 100 person‐years for treated ILDBP, 1.9 cases for DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, and 1.8 cases for treated IDH. Comparing with DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32‐fold MACE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.66), whereas treated IDH was not (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]). There was no effect modification by age, sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or cardiovascular disease history (all P values for interaction > 0.05).

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SPRINT, among treated patients with normalized systolic blood pressure, excessively low DBP was associated with an increased MACE risk, while treated IDH was not. Further research is required for treated ILDBP management.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^1118g59p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis of high or markedly low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with normalized on-treatment systolic blood pressure on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) is uncertain. This study examined whether treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with MACEs in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A total of 7582 patients with on-treatment systolic blood pressure < 130mmHg from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) were categorized on the basis of average DBP: < 60mmHg (n = 1031; treated ILDBP), 60 to 79mmHg (n = 5432), ≥ 80mmHg (n = 1119; treated IDH). MACE risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards models. Among the SPRINT participants, median age was 67.0years and 64.9% were men. Over a median follow-up of 3.4years, 512 patients developed a MACE. The incidence of MACEs was 3.9 cases per 100 person-years for treated ILDBP, 1.9 cases for DBP 60 to 79mmHg, and 1.8 cases for treated IDH. Comparing with DBP 60 to 79mmHg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32-fold MACE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.66), whereas treated IDH was not (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]). There was no effect modification by age, sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or cardiovascular disease history (all P values for interaction > 0.05).

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SPRINT, among treated patients with normalized systolic blood pressure, excessively low DBP was associated with an increased MACE risk, while treated IDH was not. Further research is required for treated ILDBP management.

IDH and CVD Events

The number of CVD events is shown in Table 2. The actual rate of primary outcome was overall 0.57 (per 100 patient‐years). Actual rates of primary outcome of each group were 0.52 (per 100 patient‐years) in the normal DBP group, 0.81 (per 100 patient‐years) in the stage 1 IDH group, and 0.96 (per 100 patient‐years) in the stage 2 IDH group. Kaplan–Meier curves and the log‐rank test showed that the incidence of reaching the composite end point of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and stroke increased with higher DBP (Figure 1). Multivariable Cox regression analysis after multiple imputation showed that high DBP was independently associated with reaching the composite end point (Table 3). Multivariable Cox regression analysis after multiple imputation showed that high DBP was independently associated with elevated risk of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and composite end point including myocardial infarction and stroke (Tables S1 through S3). Multivariable Cox regression analysis including population with all available measurements of confounding factors also showed that high DBP was independently associated with higher incidence of composite end point including myocardial infarction, angina pectors, and stroke (Table S4).

### Prevalence of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension subtypes in China [^1176sTuy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), more so than any other hypertension subtype, increases the risk for stroke and coronary heart disease. The prevalence of ISH versus other hypertension subtypes in the general Chinese adult population is not known.

Methods

The prevalence of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) was examined in a representative national sample of 15,540 Chinese adults aged 35 to 74 years. Three seated blood pressure (BP) measurements taken after 5 min of rest were averaged and hypertension subtypes were defined among individuals not receiving antihypertensive therapy as follows: ISH as systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg; IDH as systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg; and combined systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH) as a systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg.

Results

Overall, 7.6% of the Chinese adult population had ISH, 7.4% had SDH, and 4.4% had IDH. The prevalence of ISH increased with age and was more common in older women than in older men. Stage 1 hypertension was much more prevalent than stage 2 hypertension among all hypertension subtypes. The prevalence of SDH, IDH, and ISH (women, only) were higher in northern China than southern. The prevalence of ISH and SDH (women, only) were higher among rural residents versus urban residents.

Conclusions

These data document high rates of ISH in China. Given the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with ISH, our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced hypertension screening and treatment programs in China.

### Association between high blood pressure and long term cardiovascular events in young adults: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CyzVY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The population attributable fraction for cardiovascular events from raised blood pressure in young adults was higher than the corresponding blood pressure levels in older people. This finding suggests that the impact of high blood pressure on cardiovascular events is more detrimental among young people, especially above the level of 140/90 mm Hg. The reason for this effect is probably driven by age. The contributing impacts of other risk factors, including previous cardiovascular disease, impaired lung function, or longer duration of diabetes could make a greater difference at an older age and so the contributing role of hypertension diminishes; however, for young adults, with fewer comorbidities or risk factors, the role of increased blood pressure dominates.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure each independently influenced cardiovascular outcomes in young adults. The pathophysiological basis of high blood pressure in young adults and older people seems to be different. White coat hypertension, a hyperadrenergic state, a higher prevalence of secondary hypertension, and hypertension caused by peripheral blood pressure amplification are more commonly seen in young adults. Conversely, loss of arterial compliance and increased arterial stiffness are often found in older people, concurrent with increasing systolic blood pressure and decreasing diastolic blood pressure. Understanding such pathophysiological links among different age groups could help us to better understand what we found in this study. The Monica, Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monograph project, a large population based cohort, found a gradual age related shift from diastolic blood pressure to both diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure, and eventually to systolic blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular events. This finding is consistent with our results, with systolic and diastolic blood pressure independently and comparatively associated with the risk of cardiovascular events. However, outcome specific association was observed in terms of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure, the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease was identical in pattern and increased from the level of 120 mm Hg, while for all cause mortality the risk apparently rose from the level of 150–160 mm Hg. For diastolic blood pressure, the burden for stroke was more evident than coronary heart disease and all cause mortality. Given that the prevalence of isolated diastolic hypertension is more pronounced in young adults, special attention should be paid to this population.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and target organ damage: findings from the STANISLAS cohort [^113x4Vh2]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines classified hypertension into isolated diastolic (IDH), isolated systolic (ISH), and systolic and diastolic mixed (or combined) hypertension based on the elevation of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. IDH is a less prevalent hypertension definition, and is classified as elevated diastolic BP with a systolic BP within the normal range. Thresholds for hypertension diagnosis are defined as office systolic BP values (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP values (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg according to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Guidelines. In 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines lowered the cut‐off from 140/90 to 130/80 mmHg. This change had major clinical and socioeconomic implications due to the increased number of eligible patients for treatment in a cohort classically defined at low risk for cardiovascular events. A recent longitudinal analysis that included 8703 adults failed to show a significant association between IDH, as defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, and increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes. In line, previous observations demonstrated that IDH is usually not associated with cardiovascular outcomes independently of baseline systolic BP. On the other side, some studies showed a slight but significant association between diastolic hypertension and cardiovascular risk, although the larger part of these reports did not exclusively investigate IDH but diastolic hypertension in the setting of combined hypertension. Given this context, the effective cardiovascular risk linked to IDH is debatable. The Suivi Temporaire Annuel Non‐Invasif de la Santé des Lorrains Assurés Sociaux (STANISLAS) cohort is a longitudinal transgenerational study from the Nancy region of France characterized by a familial structure and a long follow‐up (up to 23 years). In this cohort, individuals underwent to an extensive cardiovascular evaluation and the hypertensive status was evaluated by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), that provides a more accurate diagnosis and a better prediction of cardiovascular risk compared to office BP. Moreover, several papers have suggested that 24‐h average blood pressure (BP) is superior to office BP in relation to hypertension target organ damage. The STANISLAS cohort therefore offers the unique opportunity of studying the early changes induced by cardiovascular risk factors in initially healthy subjects. The aim of the present study is to determine the association between IDH, identified by 24‐h ambulatory BP monitoring, and markers of target organ damage in a populational cohort with detailed cardiovascular phenotyping and long follow‐up.

Methods

Study Design, Data Sources, and Study Participants

We analyzed data from the SPRINT study. Anonymized data and materials have been made publicly available at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center and can be accessed at. The SPRINT protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the participating locations, and all participants gave their informed permission. The procedure for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and informed consent was waived as the data used were deidentified. This study adhered to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for cohort studies (Data S1).

SPRINTwas an open‐label, randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 9361 participants between 2010 and 2013 aged ≥ 50 years with SBP between 130 and 180 mm Hg, who had an increased cardiovascular risk and no history of diabetes or stroke. The participants were randomly assigned to achieve an SBP goal of < 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or < 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). BP measurements and antihypertensive drug adjustments were scheduled monthly for the first 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. The trial intervention was terminated early in 2015 due to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcomes in the intensive treatment group than in the standard treatment group.

Our study used SPRINT data from each participant's initial visit to their final visit. During the intervention and post‐intervention periods, comprehensive participant information was meticulously recorded in the SPRINT data. For instance, demographic information was collected at the outset. During the follow‐up period, clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and every 3 months. At each study visit, BP and antihypertensive drug use were recorded.

We selected participants from the SPRINT trial whose SBP readings during treatment were consistently < 130 mm Hg. We identified eligible participants by including those who had at least 2 consecutive SBP readings < 130 mm Hg. Figure Table S1 provides details on the subject selection process. To establish the starting point for follow‐up, we designated the date of the first SBP reading < 130 mm Hg as the index date.

### Prevalence, predictors, progression, and prognosis of hypertension subtypes in the framingham heart study [^115xga8Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is prevalent in nearly half of US adults and contributes to ≈96 000 deaths annually. Despite the established benefits of blood pressure (BP) lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), rates of hypertension control have been declining recently, underscoring the importance of better management of hypertension to mitigate associated vascular risk.

A recent commentaryemphasized that subphenotyping hypertension may delineate pathophysiological subsets that could be targeted with greater precision, presumably resulting in better BP control. Yet, current guidelines, approach "essential" hypertension as a uniform condition rather than as a constellation of potentially heterogeneous subphenotypes that may vary in their prevalence, temporal course, and prognosis. A potential framework for subphenotyping hypertension leverages the differential elevations of systolic BP (SBP) versus diastolic BP (DBP). SBP rises and DBP falls with aging beyond the sixth decade of life, resulting in isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) when select thresholds of SBP are exceeded but DBP remains in the normal range. The ISH phenotype has been attributed to arterial stiffening and is associated with most hypertension treatment failures in the elderly. Additional hypertension subtypes are characterized by sole elevation of DBP (isolated diastolic hypertension [IDH]) or conjoint elevations of SBP and DBP (systolic‐diastolic hypertension [SDH]).

Information regarding the epidemiology of hypertension subtypes in the current era is limited, with previous reports using BP data gathered several decades ago. Such contemporary data might be important given the rising burden of obesity and diabetes over the past 3 decades, increased awareness of and screening for high BP, and the changes over time in the BP thresholds defining hypertension among serial national guidelines. Accordingly, we characterized the prevalence, predictors, progression, and prognosis of hypertension subtypes in a large, ambulatory, community‐based sample spanning a wide age range, which was followed up over the past 3 decades.

Further Sensitivity Analyses

In sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted the categorical BP exposures (ie, IDH, ISH, and combined hypertension) for either diastolic BP or systolic BP values as baseline continuous covariables (Table S5 and Table S6). With further adjustment for diastolic BP as a continuous baseline covariable, the results from the categorical analyses were consistent with the main results presented in Tables 2 and 3. By contrast, with further adjustment for systolic BP as a continuous baseline covariable, there was no longer an association between IDH by the 2018 ESC definition and cardiovascular events. Second, for each of the individual outcomes that comprised the composite cardiovascular event end point, we repeated all of the analyses described above and found that IDH according to 24-hour ABPM criteria (by either guideline) was also not associated with any of these individual outcomes in isolation (Tables S7 and S8). Finally, third, analyses among the 9844 participants without a baseline history of cardiovascular disease produced consistent results (Tables S9 and S10).

### Overall cardiovascular prognosis of isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension and pulse pressure defined with home measurements: the finn-home study [^114j5SR3]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The overall cardiovascular prognosis of isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension and pulse pressure defined with home blood pressure (BP) measurements remains unclear.

Methods

A prospective nationwide study was initiated in 2000–2001 on 1924 randomly selected participants aged 44–74 years. We determined home and office BP at baseline and classified the individuals into four groups according to their home BP levels: normotension, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension. The primary endpoint was incidence of a composite cardiovascular event.

Results

After a median follow-up of 11.2 years, 236 individuals had suffered a cardiovascular event. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, the relative hazards and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events were significantly higher in participants with isolated diastolic hypertension (relative hazard 1.95; 95% CI, 1.06–3.57; P = 0.03), isolated systolic hypertension (relative hazard 2.08; 95% CI, 1.42–3.05; P < 0.001) and systolic-diastolic hypertension (relative hazard 2.79; 95% CI, 2.02–3.86; P < 0.001) than in participants with normotension. Home (relative hazard 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05–1.40; P = 0.009 per 10 mmHg increase), but not office (relative hazard 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00–1.21, P = 0.06) pulse pressure, adjusted for mean arterial pressure, was an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

Isolated diastolic and systolic hypertension defined with home measurements are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Close follow-up and possible treatment of these patients is therefore warranted. Home-measured pulse pressure is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events while office-measured pulse pressure is not, which fortifies the view that home BP provides more accurate risk prediction than office BP.

### Chronic kidney disease risk of isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension in young adults: a nationwide sample based-cohort study [^116oUWAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension among young adults is common. However, the effect of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), or systolic and diastolic hypertension (SDH) among young adults on chronic kidney disease (CKD) development is unknown.

Methods and Results

From a nationwide health screening database, we included 3 030 884 participants aged 20 to 39 years who were not taking antihypertensives at baseline examination in 2009 to 2010. Participants were categorized as having normal blood pressure (BP), elevated BP, stage 1 IDH, stage 1 ISH, stage 1 SDH, stage 2 IDH, stage 2 ISH, and stage 2 SDH. The primary outcome was incident CKD. A total of 5853 (0.19%) CKD events occurred. With normal BP as the reference, multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) for CKD were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.04–1.26), elevated BP; 1.19 (95% CI, 1.10–1.28), stage 1 IDH; 1.24 (95% CI, 1.08–1.42), stage 1 ISH; 1.39 (95% CI, 1.28–1.51), stage 1 SDH; 1.88 (95% CI, 1.63–2.16), stage 2 IDH; 1.84 (95% CI, 1.54–2.19), stage 2 ISH; 2.70 (95% CI, 2.44–2.98), stage 2 SDH. The HRs for CKD were attenuated in the patients who were antihypertensive and began medication within 1 year of medical checkup than in those without antihypertensives.

Conclusions

Among Korean young adults, those with elevated BP, stage 1 IDH, stage 1 ISH, stage 1 SDH, stage 2 IDH, stage 2 ISH, and stage 2 SDH were associated with a higher CKD risk than those with normal BP. The CKD risk in ISH and IDH groups was similar but lower than that in the SDH group. Antihypertensives attenuated the risk of CKD in young adults with hypertension.

### Systolic hypertension: an increasing clinical challenge in Asia [^112iKCKr]. Hypertension Research (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology of systolic hypertension in Asian populations

Hypertension is generally defined as SBP of ⩾140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) of ⩾90 mm Hg. Systolic hypertension can occur with DBP ⩾90 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic hypertension) or with normal DBP (isolated systolic hypertension), and is the predominant form of hypertension in patients ⩾60 years old.SBP increases after the age of 50–60 years, whereas DBP tends to decrease because of age-related changes in arterial vasculature, leading to a widening of pulse pressure (the difference between SBP and DBP). This suggests that SBP is the more important of the two BP components in the aging population. A meta-analysis of 41 cohort studies conducted by the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration clearly illustrated the progressive increase in SBP with advancing age in Asian patients (Figure 2). This has been corroborated by numerous other studies conducted across the region. Furthermore, a decrease in the prevalence of diastolic hypertension with age (presumably reflecting age-related changes in DBP) has also been reported in clinical studies in Asians (Figure 3).

As would be expected, the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension in Asians, which is reported to be 3.9–12.5%, is age dependent. Several studies in Asian populations have reported that the increase in prevalence is particularly noticeable in subjects aged at least 60–65 years compared with younger individuals.

The increasing proportion of older patients across Asia means that the burden of systolic hypertension is growing. It is also anticipated that this increase will be more pronounced than in the rest of the world, primarily as a result of lifestyle changes such as consuming Western-style diets and undertaking less physical activity. Hence, reducing SBP should be a primary goal for preventing cardiovascular disease in Asia, particularly in older patients with hypertension.

### Isolated diastolic vs. systolic hypertension phenotypes and outcomes: prospective cohort of newly diagnosed individuals with hypertension [^1158GoL4]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether different hypertension phenotypes, namely, isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH) have a differential outcome effect by clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated in 569 never-treated patients with sustained hypertension (age 52.6 ± 11.6 years; men 55%; clinic BP 150 ± 15/95.5 ± 10mmHg, systolic/diastolic; 24-h ambulatory BP 128.9 ± 12.6/80.6 ± 9.7) the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) events within 5 years, after adjustment for confounders, including the rate of BP control and the weighted follow-up BP.

Results

All participants received antihypertensive drug treatment (mean number of drugs 1.9 ± 1.1; follow-up visits 4.6/patient). Average clinic BP achieved during follow-up was 136 ± 12.6/83.9 ± 9.4mmHg, with 39% of participants having clinic BP less than 140/90mmHg in at least 75% of their visits, and 24% in 25–75% of visits. Prevalence of hypertension phenotypes defined using BP differed from that using ambulatory BP, whereas integration of both BP measurements reclassified the initial phenotype to another in 18% of participants. Although, no differential outcome effect was observed between clinic IDH and SDH assessed using clinic or ambulatory BP measurements, clinic BP-based ISH was associated with a higher outcome incidence than the IDH and SDH phenotypes (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.4–17.0, P = 0.015). ISH diagnosed by integration of clinic and ambulatory BP, also increased the outcome (hazard ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0–15.6, P = 0.046).

Conclusion

In hypertensive patients at low/moderate CV risk, IDH and SDH phenotypes defined by clinic BP measurements, equally determined CV events but to a lower extent compared with ISH.

### Ambulatory hypertension subtypes and 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure as distinct outcome predictors in 8341 untreated people recruited from 12 populations [^115PhLp2]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Data on risk associated with 24-hour ambulatory diastolic (DBP24) versus systolic (SBP24) blood pressure are scarce.

Methods and Results

We recorded 24-hour blood pressure and health outcomes in 8341 untreated people (mean age, 50.8 years; 46.6% women) randomly recruited from 12 populations. We computed hazard ratios (HRs) using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression. Over 11.2 years (median), 927 (11.1%) participants died, 356 (4.3%) from cardiovascular causes, and 744 (8.9%) experienced a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event. Isolated diastolic hypertension (DBP24 ≥ 80 mmHg) did not increase the risk of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or stroke (HRs ≤ 1.54; P ≥ 0.18), but was associated with a higher risk of fatal combined with nonfatal cardiovascular, cardiac, or coronary events (HRs ≥ 1.75; P ≤ 0.0054). Isolated systolic hypertension (SBP24 ≥ 130 mmHg) and mixed diastolic plus systolic hypertension were associated with increased risks of all aforementioned end points (P ≤ 0.0012). Below age 50, DBP24 was the main driver of risk, reaching significance for total (HR for 1-SD increase, 2.05; P = 0.0039) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 4.07; P = 0.0032) and for all cardiovascular end points combined (HR, 1.74; P = 0.039) with a nonsignificant contribution of SBP24 (HR ≤ 0.92; P ≥ 0.068); above age 50, SBP24 predicted all end points (HR ≥ 1.19; P ≤ 0.0002) with a nonsignificant contribution of DBP24 (0.96 ≤ HR ≤ 1.14; P ≥ 0.10). The interactions of age with SBP24 and DBP24 were significant for all cardiovascular and coronary events (P ≤ 0.043).

Conclusions

The risks conferred by DBP24 and SBP24 are age dependent. DBP24 and isolated diastolic hypertension drive coronary complications below age 50, whereas above age 50 SBP24 and isolated systolic and mixed hypertension are the predominant risk factors.

Table 1
Cardiovascular Outcomes Associated With Isolated Systolic or Diastolic Hypertension According to 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Blood Pressure Classification in Adult Cancer Survivors in the National Health Insurance Service Database.

In a nationwide study of adult cancer survivors, elevated BP, stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension, IDH, and SDH and stage 2 IDH, stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension, and stage 2 SDH according to the 2017 AHA/ACC BP guideline subcategorization were associated with an increased risk of composite CVD, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. The previous observational study investigating association between 2017 AHA/ACC BP guideline categorization with CVD has been limited by only selecting patients with a history of breast, colorectal, or stomach cancer without the further subcategorization of isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension rather than including long‐term cancer survivors. Our findings extend previous data by providing more precise risk stratification with isolated systolic or diastolic BP subcategorization according to the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline from nearly 170 000 survivors of all cancer sites. Overall, our findings provide additional clinical insights for a more comprehensive understanding of the association between isolated BP and CVD risk in adult cancer survivors, highlighting heterogeneity in excess CVD risk across certain cancer subtypes as well as the need for more personalized BP treatment strategies for CVD risk reduction in this vulnerable population. This study is limited by the absence of data on cancer staging for the primary cancer sites such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary staging. Also, information on specific cardiotoxic treatments, such as anthracyclines, trastuzumab as well as hypertension‐inducing antineoplastic agents like vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab), could not be identified and incorporated into the analyses. Thus, future studies are warranted to investigate the potential interactions of initial cancer stage diagnosis, of specific cardiotoxic treatments, and the observed variations in excess risk across different CVD events by the BP subcategories (eg, stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension versus stage 2 IDH) among adult cancer survivors. Despite this limitation, our findings highlight the need for optimal BP subcategorization and management strategies for CVD prevention in adult cancer survivors.

Discussion

In contrast to the traditional classification of hypertension into isolated systolic, isolated diastolic, and systolic-diastolic hypertension, we investigated the hemodynamic differences between PDH and PSH by recording non-invasive hemodynamics in supine and upright positions. Participants were categorized into the PDH or PSH groups based on the percentage elevation of aortic BP above 85 mmHg diastolic or 125 mmHg systolic, respectively. Aortic BP was chosen for classification because central pressure is thought to be more strongly associated with vascular disease and mortality than brachial pressure. Additionally, a central BP of 125/85 mmHg closely corresponds to a brachial BP of 135/85 mmHg. In ambulatory BP recordings, 135/85 mmHg serves as the hypertension cut-off, while cut-off levels for radial tonometric BP in our laboratory are very similar. The PDH group had the highest proportion of men, while both hypertensive groups were older, had higher BMI, and exhibited slightly lower eGFRcys than normotensive participants. Hemodynamic analyses were adjusted for these differences. Notably, BP measurements conducted by research nurses and physicians yielded consistent results, confirming the reliability of the tonometric BP measurements.

Both hypertensive groups exhibited less favorable metabolic profiles, characterized by higher total and LDL cholesterol, uric acid, and glucose concentrations in fasting plasma samples compared to normotensive controls. Insulin sensitivity, assessed using QUICKI, was also lower in both hypertensive groups — findings that are commonly observed in patients with hypertension. In the PDH group, blood hemoglobin levels were higher, while HDL cholesterol concentrations were lower than in normotensive subjects. This group had the highest proportion of men, who typically have higher hemoglobin and lower HDL cholesterol levels than women. Subsequently, these differences were no longer observed after adjusting for sex. Plasma aldosterone concentrations did not differ among the groups, but plasma renin activity was lowest in the PSH group, resulting in the highest aldosterone-to-renin ratio in this group.

Primary aldosteronism may affect over 10% of hypertensive patients. Screening for primary aldosteronism is recommended if BP exceeds 150/100 mmHg in patients prone to hypokalemia. In the present study, six patients from the PDH group and 23 patients from the PSH group met the screening criteria for primary aldosteronism. We previously found that bioimpedance recordings can detect extracellular fluid excess in patients with primary aldosteronism. Similar extracellular water balance and plasma concentrations of potassium and aldosterone in all study groups suggest that the possible presence of primary aldosteronism had no major effects on the present results.

Sensitivity Analyses

The results of the first sensitivity analysis, with further adjustment for the length of time between the start of the SPRINT follow‐up and the index date, were comparable to those found in the primary analysis (Table 2). The second sensitivity analysis applying other treated IDH cutoffs gave comparable results to the initial analysis (Table S1). The third sensitivity analysis using the residual method revealed an association between treated ILDBP (aHR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.07–1.69]) or treated IDH (aHR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.75–1.56]) and MACEs comparable to the primary analysis. The heat map revealed that along the vertical axis, the 3‐year risk of MACEs was significantly associated with DBP levels (P value = 0.0068; Figure S3).

### Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with midlife diastolic blood pressure and transition to late-life hypertensive phenotypes [^116r8aie]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the principal focus of modern control of hypertension because of the strong short‐ and mid‐term associations with acute vascular events, 1 the proven efficacy of hypertensive treatment for isolated systolic hypertension 2, 3, 4 and the greater population attributable burden of SBP‐associated cardiovascular events, reflecting the high incidence of both cardiovascular events and isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. 5 Specifically, SBP tends to increase and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tends to decrease in late life. 6 Therefore, short‐term associations with SBP in late life may not reflect the long‐term attributable risk of cardiovascular events caused by midlife diastolic hypertension, particularly if the risk associated with midlife DBP is mediated by late‐life SBP.

Arterial stiffness is associated with recurrent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality, independent of age, blood pressure (BP), and cardiovascular risk factors. 7, 8 It is strongly associated with age and a history of hypertension, 9 is often described as a measure of "vascular age", and features in clinical guidelines as a marker of hypertensive end‐organ damage. 10, 11 Studies that have assessed the longitudinal relationships between age, arterial stiffness, and BP have largely reported an association between increased SBP and progression of arterial stiffness, 9, 12, 13 although some have reported no evidence of a direct relationship, 6 or sex‐specific differences in longitudinal progression of arterial stiffness. 14 However, studies have not reported the bidirectional interactions between increased SBP or DBP and progression of arterial stiffness and the modification of longitudinal changes in BP by increasing arterial stiffness in midlife.

In addition to being a marker of hypertensive end‐organ damage, 6 arterial stiffness may directly induce end‐organ injury through reduced damping of the systolic pressure wave, increased pulse wave reflection from the periphery, and impaired Windkessel function of the aorta, 15 resulting in increased systolic pressures, increased pulsatility of aortic BP, and greater transmission of pulsatile flow to the distal circulation. 16 The low‐resistance arterial beds in the kidney and brain are particularly susceptible to the increased pulsatility of aortic blood flow, resulting in a strong association between aortic stiffness and cerebral arterial pulsatility with acute lacunar stroke, 17 white matter injury, 18 and the associated sequelae of decline in mobility, late‐onset refractory depression, and dementia. 19 To develop strategies to prevent end‐organ injury, it is critical to understand the magnitude and direction of the relationship between BP and arterial stiffness, and the optimal period for intervention to prevent increased arterial stiffness.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension is not associated with endothelial dysfunction [^1149QDEq]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelial function. However, it is unclear whether isolated diastolic hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of endothelial function with isolated diastolic hypertension diagnosed by using two major hypertension guidelines: systolic blood pressure (BP) < 130mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 80mmHg according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guideline and systolic BP < 140mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 90mmHg according to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) hypertension guideline. We measured the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in subjects without systolic hypertension who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs. Of 3727 subjects (2813 men; mean age: 41.3 ± 10.9 years), 749 (20.1%) had isolated diastolic hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA definition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction, defined as FMD < 7.0% (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98–1.35; P = 0.09). Of 4747 subjects (3727 men; mean age: 45.1 ± 10.8 years), 314 subjects (6.6%) had isolated diastolic hypertension according to the ESC/ESH definition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction after adjusting for age and sex (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82–1.32; P = 0.76). Isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction in individuals who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs regardless of the major hypertension guideline definition used.

### Maternal hypertensive traits and adverse outcome in pregnancy: a mendelian randomization study [^111xJ3WX]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity. The spectrum of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy encompasses chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Chronic hypertension either predates pregnancy or is diagnosed before 20 weeks' gestation, whilst gestational hypertension arises de novo post-20 weeks' gestation in the absence of proteinuria, biochemical or hematologic abnormalities. Preeclampsia, at the more severe end of the spectrum, is characterized by hypertension occurring de novo after 20 weeks' gestation with evidence of proteinuria, intrauterine growth restriction or end-organ damage. Multiple observational studies have demonstrated associations between maternal blood pressure prior to pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. However, observational studies are liable to confounding and reverse causality. Even with careful adjustment for measured confounders, it is nearly impossible to accurately mirror the complex panoply of biological, behavioral and psychosocial factors that factor into the interplay between obstetric and cardiovascular risk. This is especially true for outcomes such as preterm birth and preeclampsia, where the pathophysiology remains relatively poorly understood. Improving our understanding of determinants of adverse feto-maternal outcomes in pregnancy is a public health priority, which may help improve risk stratification and targeted care provision to ultimately improve obstetric outcome.

Mendelian randomization leverages genetic variants as proxies for exposures in instrumental variable analysis to study exposure-outcome relationships. Given the independent and random distribution of genetic variants at meiosis, the Mendelian randomization paradigm is less vulnerable to limitations of phenotypic observational study, namely confounding and reverse causality. Our group previously applied the Mendelian randomization framework to provide genetic evidence for the causal effect of SBP, alongside other cardiometabolic traits, on preeclampsia or eclampsia risk. We also demonstrated that SBP is associated with reduced birthweight independently of preeclampsia or eclampsia. Further investigation of drug-target perturbation verified safety and efficacy profiles of genetically proxied beta-adrenergic antagonism and calcium channel blockade on risk of preeclampsia and low birthweight, echoing recent large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the causal relevance of blood pressure on other important obstetric outcomes, such as preterm birth and placental abruption, remains unexplored. In addition, no genetic data exist exploring the role of blood pressure indices other than SBP. These data are relevant, as isolated diastolic hypertension is commonest in the age range overlapping with the majority of pregnancies. NHANES III highlighted that isolated diastolic hypertension was the commonest hypertensive subtype in participants aged less than 40 years, with the Framingham Heart study also showing that young age was a predictor for isolated diastolic hypertension.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension in childhood and risk of adult subclinical target organ damage: a 30-year prospective cohort study [^114R1fhM]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity measured noninvasively is often used as an indicator of arterial stiffness and is closely related to long-term cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Our results found that IDH and mixed hypertension in adolescents significantly increased the risk of adult arterial stiffness. In fact, this finding is similar with an early Framingham report. In patients less than 50 years of age, DBP was predictive of CHD risk and SBP was not, with hazard ratios of 1.42 (P = 0.001) and 0.95 (P = 0.49), respectively. The finding was also consistent with increased peripheral resistance being dominant in determining the CHD risk in young hypertensives. DBP and isolated diastolic hypertension drive arterial stiffness in younger participants. IDH in adolescents and young adults is an important risk factor for long-term arterial stiffness that must be treated.

Ascertainment of End Points

We ascertained vital status and the incidence of fatal and nonfatal events from the appropriate sources in each country. All events were prespecified and coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The coprimary end points were total mortality and a composite cardiovascular event consisting of cardiovascular mortality (ICD-8 [ICD, Eighth Revision], 390–448; ICD-9 [ICD, Ninth Revision], 390.0–459.9; and ICD-10 [ICD, Tenth Revision], I00–I79 and R96), coronary events (death from ischemic heart disease [ICD-8, 411–412; ICD-9, 411 and 414; and ICD-10, I20 and I24–I25], sudden death [ICD-8, 427.2 and 795; ICD-9, 427.5 and 798; and ICD-10, I46 and R96], nonfatal myocardial infarction [ICD-8 or ICD-9, 410 and ICD-10, I21-I22], and coronary revascularization), stroke (ICD-8 or ICD-9, 430–434 and 436; and ICD-10, I60–I64 and I67–I68, not including transient ischemic attack), and heart failure (ICD-8, 427.0, 427.1, 427.2, 428, 429, 519.1, and 782.4, ICD-9, 429, and ICD-10, I50 and J81). Secondary outcomes included each of the individual outcomes included in the composite cardiovascular event end point. All outcomes were validated against hospital files or medical records held by participants' primary care physicians or specialists. In analyses of composite outcomes, we only considered the first event.

Secondary hypertension — Prevalence, screening triggers, and renovascular disease frequency: Secondary causes of hypertension can be identified in approximately 5% to 25% of adult patients with hypertension, and patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension and concomitant conditions should be screened with a history and physical examination and laboratory tests. Indicators raising suspicion include stage 2 hypertension, treatment-resistant hypertension, sudden onset of hypertension, increased BP in patients previously controlled on drug therapy, early-onset hypertension (age < 30 years), diastolic hypertension in older adults, and target organ damage disproportionate to the duration or severity. Common forms include primary aldosteronism and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension, although only a small fraction (0.1% to 5%) is hemodynamically significant.

### Associations between blood pressure and arterial stiffness with cognition: neuroaggression or neuroselection? [^113Vn6Gy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness are closely intertwined. 1, 2 Indeed, although elevated BP was traditionally viewed as a determinant of arterial stiffness, in the recent decades it has become evident that higher levels of arterial stiffness may also lead to subsequent increases in BP and incident hypertension. The bidirectional nature and strength of these associations seem to vary across the life course such that, in the young, arterial stiffening may be predominantly attributable to elevated diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 1, 3 whereas in middle‐aged and older individuals, arterial stiffness leads to increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) but not DBP, and thus increases in pulse pressure. 1 This complex chain of events is consistent with the shift in the predominant subtypes of hypertension observed throughout aging, from isolated diastolic hypertension in the young to isolated systolic hypertension in the middle‐aged and elderly. 1, 2

Discussion

In this international study of adults with 24-hour ABPM recordings, 2 interesting and novel findings become evident. First, we found no association of IDH, as defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and using 24-hour ABPM readings, with adverse outcomes in the sample overall. By contrast and concordant with prior IDACO reports, IDH on 24-hour ABPM as defined by the 2018 ESC guideline was associated with cardiovascular events, although not with death. The second observation, which addresses an issue of controversy, was that after stratifying the study sample by age, IDH on 24-hour ABPM was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events (both for the 2017 ACC/AHA and the 2018 ESC definitions of IDH) among participants younger than 50 years only.

### Effects of prehypertension and hypertension subtype on cardiovascular disease in the Asia-Pacific region [^112CVFFA]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure defined blood pressure (BP) levels of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg as prehypertension and those of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg as hypertension. Hypertension can be divided into 3 categories, isolated diastolic (IDH; systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg), isolated systolic (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg), and systolic-diastolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg). Although there is clear evidence that isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension increase the risks of future vascular events, there remains uncertainty about the effects of IDH. The objective was to determine the effects of prehypertension and hypertension subtypes (IDH, isolated systolic hypertension, and systolic-diastolic hypertension) on the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Asia-Pacific Region. The Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration is an individual participant data overview of cohort studies in the region. This analysis included a total of 346570 participants from 36 cohort studies. Outcomes were fatal and nonfatal CVD. The relationship between BP categories and CVD was explored using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, cholesterol, and smoking and stratified by sex and study. Compared with normal BP (< 120/80 mmHg), hazard ratios (95% CIs) for CVD were 1.41 (1.31–1.53) for prehypertension, 1.81 (1.61–2.04) for IDH, 2.18 (2.00–2.37) for isolated systolic hypertension, and 3.42 (3.17–3.70) for systolic-diastolic hypertension. Separately significant effects of prehypertension and hypertension subtypes were also observed for coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. In the Asia-Pacific region, prehypertension and all hypertension subtypes, including IDH, thus clearly predicted increased risks of CVD.

### Phenotypes of hypertension: impact of age and sex on hemodynamic mechanisms [^113PAVHP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Essential hypertension is a common condition and the leading risk factor for death globally. Despite this, only a minority of patients are appropriately identified and treated to reach recommended blood pressure (BP) targets. Although often treated as a uniform condition, essential hypertension encompasses a number of distinct patterns of BP elevation such as isolated systolic (ISH), systolic diastolic (SDH), and isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), which differ in prevalence, depending on age. Indeed, data from the Framingham Heart Study in > 2700 individuals show that the prevalence of ISH is lowest in adults in their 30s but increases thereafter. In contrast, the proportion of patients with IDH declines with age whereas SDH is predominant in middle age. More recent studies have shown that ISH is also the most common form of hypertension in adolescents and young adults.,

Previous investigations have demonstrated that elevated cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) are dominant hemodynamic mechanisms underlying ISH in young adults, whereas increased arterial stiffness is associated with ISH in older individuals. Earlier investigations in essential hypertension, involving mostly middle‐aged individuals, describe a predominantly SDH phenotype characterized by normal or low CO or cardiac index (CI), but increased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Taken together, these studies suggest that the factors underlying the different hypertension phenotypes also vary according to age. However, a detailed analysis of the hemodynamic variables associated with each hypertensive phenotype and whether these differ by sex, has not been undertaken within a single, large population, covering the adult age span, using consistent methodologies throughout. We hypothesized that different hemodynamic mechanisms account for the observed age‐ and sex‐related differences in hypertensive phenotypes and our aim was to test this hypothesis in a large population of healthy individuals, covering the adult age span.

### Hypertension subtype and risk of cardiovascular disease in Chinese adults [^116pjmfT]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We examined the relationship between hypertension subtype and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality in Chinese adults.

Methods and Results

We conducted a prospective cohort study in a nationally representative sample of 169 871 Chinese men and women aged ≥ 40 years. Data on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and other variables were obtained at a baseline examination in 1991 with the use of standard protocols. Follow-up evaluation was conducted in 1999–2000, with a response rate of 93.4%. Hypertension subtypes were defined as combined systolic and diastolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), isolated systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 and DBP < 90 mm Hg), isolated diastolic hypertension (SBP < 140 and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and 2 categories of treated hypertension (SBP < 140 and DBP < 90 mm Hg or SBP ≥ 140 and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). After participants with missing BP values were excluded, 169 577 adults were included in the analyses. Compared with normotensives, relative risks (95% CIs) of cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality were 2.73 (2.60 to 2.86) and 2.53 (2.39 to 2.68) for combined systolic and diastolic hypertension, 1.78 (1.69 to 1.87) and 1.68 (1.58 to 1.78) for isolated systolic hypertension, 1.59 (1.43 to 1.76) and 1.45 (1.27 to 1.65) for isolated diastolic hypertension, 2.01 (1.64 to 2.48) and 1.61 (1.28 to 2.03) for treated hypertension with SBP < 140 and DBP < 90 mm Hg, and 3.37 (3.07 to 3.69) and 2.88 (2.60 to 3.19) for treated hypertension with SBP ≥ 140 and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, respectively, after adjustment for important covariables.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that all hypertension subtypes are associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease in Chinese adults. Primary prevention of hypertension should be a public health priority in the Chinese population.

Results

Characteristics of Study Participants

A total of 7582 SPRINT participants aged ≥ 50 years with at least 2 consecutive readings of SBP < 130 mm Hg were identified for analysis (Figure S1). These participants' median age was 67.0 years, and 64.9% were men. The participants were divided into 3 groups according to their average DBP levels: < 60 mm Hg (n = 1031), 60 to 79 mm Hg (n = 5432), and ≥ 80 mm Hg (n = 1119). Compared with the other 2 DBP groups, treated ILDBP participants were more likely to be older and never smokers, have a lower body mass index and total cholesterol, and have greater risk of ASCVD. The participants with treated IDH, who were more likely to be younger and active smokers, had a greater body mass index and total cholesterol but a decreased risk of ASCVD (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of the Study Participants by DBP Group

Overall Analyses

During a median (interquartile range) follow‐up of 3.4 (2.7–4.0) years, 512 participants developed MACEs. Figure S2 illustrates the HRs and 95% CIs for MACEs according to deciles of average DBP, with adjustment for covariates. Only in the lowest decile group (average DBP < 58 mm Hg) was the risk significantly higher than the population average risk (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.40 [95% CI, 1.10–1.77]).

When participants were divided into 3 DBP groups, the incidence of MACEs per 100 person‐years were 3.9 for treated ILDBP, 1.9 for DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, and 1.8 for treated IDH. Compared with DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32‐fold risk of MACEs (aHR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.05–1.66]), whereas treated IDH was not (aHR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]; Table 2). Treated ILDBP was associated with an increased risk for all MACE types, with coronary heart disease having the highest risk (aHR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.28–1.46]; Table 2).

### Systolic and diastolic hypertension among patients on hemodialysis: musings on volume overload, arterial stiffness, and erythropoietin [^116czPAb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension among patients on hemodialysis is predominantly systolic (either isolated or combined with diastolic hypertension), whereas the scenario of isolated diastolic hypertension is rare and more common in younger patients. Uncontrolled hypertension that persists despite aggressive antihypertensive drug therapy is a reflection of the volume overload that is a prominent mediator of systolic and diastolic BP elevation. Clinical-trial evidence supports the notion that dry-weight probing is an effective strategy to improve BP control, even when overt clinical signs and symptoms of volume overload are not present. Accelerated arterial stiffness influences the patterns and rhythms of interdialytic ambulatory BP and is a major determinant of isolated systolic hypertension in hemodialysis. Posthoc analyses of the Hypertension in Hemodialysis patients treated with Atenolol or Lisinopril (HDPAL) trial, however, suggest that arterial stiffness does not make hypertension more resistant to therapy and is unable to predict the treatment-induced improvement in left ventricular hypertrophy. A combined strategy of sodium restriction, dry-weight adjustment, and antihypertensive medication use was effective in improving ambulatory BP control regardless of the severity of underlying arteriosclerosis in HDPAL. Other nonvolume-dependent mechanisms, such as erythropoietin use, appear to be also important contributors and should be taken into consideration, particularly in younger hemodialysis patients with diastolic hypertension. In this article, we explore the role of volume overload, arterial stiffness, and erythropoietin use as causes of systolic vs diastolic hypertension in patients on hemodialysis. We conclude with clinical practice recommendations and with a call for a "volume-first" approach when managing hemodialysis hypertension.

### Diastolic blood pressure and mortality in the elderly with cardiovascular disease [^1112SzhM]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Isolated systolic hypertension is predominantly observed in the elderly because of increased arterial stiffness. Aggressive treatment leads to excessive lowering of diastolic blood pressure and favors the presence of a J-shaped curve association with mortality. We investigated whether, in the elderly, this pattern of association is a simple epiphenomenon of increased arterial stiffness and impaired cardiac function. In a cohort of 331 hospitalized subjects > 70 years old (mean age ± SD: 85 ± 7 years), aortic pulse wave velocity and pressure wave reflections, by pulse wave analysis, and cardiac function, by ultrasound, were assessed. During a 2-year follow-up period, 110 subjects died. No association of prognosis with systolic pressure, pulse pressure, or pulse wave velocity was observed. A J-shaped association between diastolic pressure and overall and cardiovascular mortality was observed. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis showed that patients in the first tertile of diastolic pressure (≤ 60 mm Hg) had higher mortality. In Cox regression analysis, diastolic pressure ≤ 60 mm Hg was a predictor of mortality independently from cardiac-vascular properties, cardiovascular risk factors, and drug treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that increased age and low total peripheral resistance, but not left ventricular function, were the cardinal determinants of low diastolic pressure. An "optimal" diastolic pressure of 70 mm Hg in subjects with isolated systolic hypertension was found. We showed that, in the frail elderly, a value of diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mm Hg is associated with reduced survival, independent from large artery stiffness and left ventricular function, suggesting that more rational antihypertensive therapy, not only based on systolic pressure level, is needed.

Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertension:

- Definition: According to the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines, elevated BP is defined as systolic pressure of 120–129 mmHg and diastolic pressure < 80 mmHg, stage 1 HTN is defined as SBP of 130–139 mmHg or DBP of 80–89 mmHg, and stage 2 HTN is defined as SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the 2024 ESC guidelines, elevated BP is defined as an office SBP of 120–139 mmHg or DBP of 70–89 mmHg, and HTN is defined as an office SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg.
- Pathophysiology: Primary HTN etiology is multifactorial and most frequently associated with a combination of environmental (unhealthy diet, increased sodium intake, insufficient potassium intake, inadequate physical activity, overweight/obesity) and genetic factors (multiple risk alleles, gene-gene interactions, fetal programming, epigenetic mechanisms). Secondary HTN etiology includes primary aldosteronism, renal HTN, renal parenchymal disease, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, acromegaly, coarctation of the aorta, and medication or recreational drug use (amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine). White-coat HTN and isolated systolic HTN are essential subtypes.
- Epidemiology: HTN is highly prevalent worldwide. The prevalence of HTN in the US is estimated at 31,900 per 100,000 adults based on the 140/90 mmHg cutoff. Rates are highest in African Americans and increase with age.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for primary HTN include nonmodifiable factors, such as advancing age, African and Hispanic ancestry, and family history, and modifiable factors, include an unhealthy diet, high sodium intake, low potassium intake, physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, low socioeconomic status, and limited access to healthcare.
- Disease course: HTN is mostly asymptomatic until an acute hypertensive crisis or end-organ complications occur. Manifestations of end-organ damage in HTN include motor or sensory deficit (brain); hypertensive retinopathy (retina); and AF, arrhythmias, pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema (heart). Secondary HTN presents with symptoms of the causal condition, for example, abdominal bruit in renal artery stenosis or abdominal masses in polycystic kidney disease. A fourth heart sound is often the earliest sign of hypertensive heart disease. HTN decreases health-related QoL.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Prognosis is highly dependant on the BP and end-organ damage. Higher BP and more severe retinopathy or organ damage are associated with a worse prognosis. Untreated or treatment-resistant HTN leads to lower survival rates. However, effective BP control raises 10-year survival rates to 70%.

### Blood pressure goals in acute stroke [^1174N4RT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension remains the most powerful risk factor of stroke worldwideand in the stroke prone population in Asia, irrespective of its subtype, either hemorrhagic or ischemic. Antihypertensive drug treatment is highly effective in primary prevention of stroke in patients with hypertension. Current hypertension guidelines recommend initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with conventionally defined hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg)and in high-risk patients with hypertension newly defined in the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines (≥ 130/80 mm Hg). In most guidelines, blood pressure is recommended to reduce to a level below 140/90 mm Hg and if possible and tolerable to 130/80 mm Hg or even lower. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a universal blood pressure goal of 130/80 mm Hg. In fact, the relationship between blood pressure and the risk of stroke is linear and direct, regardless whether blood pressure is measured in the officeor out-of-office setting. In addition, the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment is greater for the prevention of stroke than for other clinical outcomes, such as coronary events. Indeed, the relative risk reduction for approximately each 10/5 mm Hg reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was about 42% for stroke and 14% for coronary events in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension. The corresponding risk reductions in patients with isolated systolic hypertension were 30% and 23%, respectively. No J-curve has ever been observed for stroke, as for other clinical outcomes such as coronary events.

### Hyperdynamic circulation distinguishes predominantly diastolic hypertension from predominantly systolic hypertension [^116anV9b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure is traditionally classified into systolic-diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, and isolated diastolic hypertension. In this cross-sectional study, participants not using antihypertensive medications (n = 654) were divided into normotensive subjects (n = 421), and predominantly systolic (n = 130) versus predominantly diastolic hypertension (n = 103) based on the percentage elevation of aortic blood pressure above 125 mmHg systolic or 85 mmHg diastolic. Non-invasive hemodynamics were recorded using radial applanation tonometry and whole-body impedance cardiography during passive head-up tilt. Mean aortic blood pressures in the groups were 108/73, 141/89, and 131/94 mmHg, respectively. Mean age and BMI (43.6, 47.3 and 52.6 years; 25.9, 28.7 and 28.7 kg/m 2, respectively) were lower in the normotensive than in hypertensive participants (p < 0.05). Predominantly systolic hypertension was characterized by higher forward wave amplitude, central pulse pressure, and systemic vascular resistance (p < 0.003 for all) than predominantly diastolic hypertension. Predominantly diastolic hypertension was characterized by higher heart rate and cardiac index (p < 0.004 for both), but lower stroke volume (p < 0.002), than predominantly systolic hypertension. Both hypertensive groups had increased systemic vascular resistance, but highest values were observed in predominantly systolic hypertension (p < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity was equally elevated by ~1 m/s in both hypertensive groups (p < 0.001). In response to head-up tilt, the increase in systemic vascular resistance, and the decrease in cardiac output, were more pronounced in predominantly systolic versus diastolic hypertension. To conclude, predominantly diastolic hypertension featured hyperdynamic circulation, while increased pulse pressure in predominantly systolic hypertension was related to higher stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance than in predominantly diastolic hypertension.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and target organ damage: findings from the STANISLAS cohort [^117TuPus]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population

This cross‐sectional study is derived from the STANISLAS cohort, a single‐center familial longitudinal cohort comprised of 1006 families (4295 subjects) from the Nancy region recruited in 1993–1995 at the Center for Preventive Medicine. The cohort was established with the primary objective of investigating gene–gene and gene–environment interactions in the field of cardiovascular diseases. The families were deemed healthy, free of declared acute and/or chronic illness, in order to assess the effect of genetics on the variability of intermediate phenotypes on the transition toward disease. From 2011 to 2019, 1705 survivors of the original cohort underwent their fourth examination (STANISLAS‐V4) at our department, as previously described. The research protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est III‐Nancy‐France) and all study participants gave a written informed consent to participate. The informed written consent was approved previously by the local ethics committee (identifier NCT01391442).

For the present study, 1605 adult patients (i.e. ≥ 18 years old and with ambulatory BP measurements) attending STANISLAS‐V4 were included in the analyses (Figure 1). All participants were scheduled to attend the Centre d'Investigation Clinique Plurithématique Pierre Drouin at Nancy University Hospital at 8after a 12‐ to 14‐h fast. All subjects underwent blood and urine sampling for laboratory analysis. Medical history, medications, anthropometric parameters were also recorded.

### Peripheral arterial disease and isolated systolic hypertension: the ATTEST study [^116cNFmp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases, either coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The relationships between those different localizations of CV disease and the haemodynamic features of hypertension have been poorly evaluated in the past. In the ATTEST study, a geographically representative panel of 3020 general practitioners recruited 8316 consecutive patients with CV diseases (PAD, CAD or CVD, alone or in association). Blood pressure, which was not an inclusion criterion, was then measured and related to the different forms of CV diseases. Blood pressure classification involved 20% normotensive subjects, 24% subjects with controlled hypertension, 42% subjects with isolated systolic hypertension and 14% subjects with systolic-diastolic hypertension, all hypertensives with or without antihypertensive therapy. From multiple regression analysis, it appeared that subjects with systolic hypertension were characterized by the presence of PAD, with little or no presence of CAD and/or CVD. Subjects with systolic-diastolic hypertension were characterized by the presence of CAD and/or CVD, but without PAD. Although the former was only influenced by age, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus influenced the latter. This study confirms the high prevalence of hypertension (80%) in a large population of patients with CV diseases selected in primary care. Analysis of different features of hypertension revealed that isolated systolic hypertension was the most prevalent form of hypertension in this treated population. Finally, one of the predominant goals of secondary prevention in subjects with PAD should be the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension.

### Vascular function: a key player in hypertension [^115BNMT1]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The major functions of the arterial system are to "efficiently deliver blood to the peripheral organs and maintain vascular homeostasis". Both the endothelial and medial layer contribute to the three major functions, namely, conversion of pulsatile to steady blood flow, appropriate distribution of blood flow to the target organs, and vascular protection and homeostasis. Vascular dysfunction contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases through a combination of several mechanisms, including impaired coronary perfusion, cardiac systolic/diastolic dysfunction, microvascular damage, and abnormal hemodynamics in the arterial tree. The representative marker of endothelial function is flow-mediated vasodilatation and that of the medial layer function is pulse wave velocity, and that of the blood supply function of the arterial tree is the ankle-brachial pressure index. In hypertension, vascular dysfunction could also lead to the development of isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, and systolic/diastolic hypertension. Vascular dysfunction is involved in a vicious cycle with abnormal blood pressure variability. Furthermore, a vicious cycle may also exist between vascular dysfunction and hypertension. While the significances of vascular function tests to predict future cardiovascular events has been established in cases of hypertension, their usefulness in assessing the effectiveness of management of the vascular functions in hypertension on the cardiovascular outcomes has not yet been fully clarified. Thus, vascular dysfunction plays crucial roles in the pathophysiology of hypertension, and further research is warranted to establish strategies to improve vascular dysfunction in cases of hypertension. Vascular functions in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Vascular dysfunction and elevation of blood pressure are components of a vicious cycle even from their early stages, which including abnormal blood pressure variabilities. This vicious cycle is associated with hypertensive organ damage and also adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Strategies to break this vicious cycle have not yet been fully established.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115yQsni]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Isolated systolic hypertension in the young — definition, risk, and management — recognizes that "some young, healthy people, and men in particular, may present with isolated grade 1 systolic hypertension (i.e. brachial SBP ≥ 140–159 mmHg and a normal DBP < 90 mmHg) and this may be associated with a normal central aortic SBP due to excessive peripheral systolic pressure amplification". Prognosis is uncertain because "it is unclear whether isolated systolic hypertension in the context of a normal aortic pressure is benign", though prospective data showed "young men with isolated systolic hypertension had a CV risk similar to that of individuals with high–normal BP" and the condition "was closely associated with smoking". Management emphasizes lifestyle and surveillance: "these young individuals should receive recommendations on lifestyle modification (particularly cessation of smoking); whether they should receive drug treatment is unclear, but they do require longer-term follow-up as many will develop sustained hypertension".

### Diagnostic and therapeutic problems of isolated systolic hypertension [^111dsANr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increases with age, due to progressive elevation of SBP, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Extensive research has shown that lowering SBP improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, yet SBP control rates remain largely inadequate regardless of antihypertensive treatment. Arterial stiffness is a major determinant of elevated SBP resulting from structural changes in the vascular system, mediated by neurohormonal alterations that occur with vascular ageing. Clinical data have demonstrated an independent association between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, arterial stiffness has the potential to be an important therapeutic target in the management of isolated systolic hypertension. Current antihypertensive treatments have limited effects on arterial stiffness, so the development of new treatments addressing neurohormonal alterations central to vascular ageing is important. Such therapies may represent effective strategies in the future management of SBP.

### Blood pressure level in late adolescence and risk for cardiovascular events: a cohort study [^1177y9Sp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Not enough is known about the association between blood pressure (BP) in adolescence and future cardiovascular events.

Objective

To measure this association using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for classifying BP elevation.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Sweden.

Participants

Males in late adolescence who were conscripted into the military from 1969 to 1997.

Measurements

Baseline BP was measured at conscription. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage.

Results

The study included 1366519 males with a mean age of 18.3 years. The baseline BP was classified as elevated (120 to 129/ < 80 mm Hg) for 28.8% of participants and hypertensive (≥ 130/80 mm Hg) for 53.7%. During a median follow-up of 35.9 years, 79644 had a primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.10 for elevated BP (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.13), 1.15 for stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) (CI, 1.11 to 1.18), 1.23 for stage 1 isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) (CI, 1.18 to 1.28), 1.32 for stage 1 systolic-diastolic hypertension (SDH) (CI, 1.27 to 1.37), 1.31 for stage 2 ISH (CI, 1.28 to 1.35), 1.55 for stage 2 IDH (CI, 1.42 to 1.69), and 1.71 for stage 2 SDH (CI, 1.58 to 1.84). The cumulative risk for cardiovascular events also increased gradually across BP stages, ranging from 14.7% for normal BP to 24.3% for stage 2 SDH at age 68 years.

Limitation

This was an observational study of Swedish men.

Conclusion

Increasing BP levels in late adolescence are associated with gradually increasing risks for major cardiovascular events, beginning at a BP level of 120/80 mm Hg.

### Racial disparities in hypertension subtype prevalence over the lifecourse: evidence of accelerated arterial ageing in a population representative cross-sectional study [^1152hc2y]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Racially minoritised populations, particularly Black individuals, have been shown to have an earlier average age of onset of hypertension (elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure) compared with White individuals potentially due to 'weathering' or accelerated health declines due to the cumulative impact of marginalisation over the lifecourse. Systolic blood pressure is more reactive to stress, increases linearly with age indicative of arterial ageing and is more highly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality versus diastolic blood pressure. However, little research has examined racial differences in isolated systolic hypertension. This study examines the race/gender differences in the prevalence of two mutually exclusive manifestations of hypertension: diastolic hypertension (ie, elevated diastolic with or without elevated systolic blood pressure) and isolated systolic hypertension (increased systolic only) over the lifecourse.

Methods

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2016 to 2020, a US-based population representative cross-sectional study, was used in weighted multinomial logistic regression models to estimate age-specific prevalence of hypertension subtypes by race/gender subgroups controlling for socioeconomic status and anti-hypertensive use. Outcomes were diastolic (diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg with/without systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg) and isolated systolic (systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic < 90 mm Hg) hypertension.

Results

The prevalence of diastolic hypertension increased until midlife and then decreased with increasing age, while the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increased throughout the lifecourse. Black women had nearly triple the prevalence of diastolic hypertension from 20 to 45 years where the disparity lessens to double the prevalence and continues to lessen with increasing age and 2–3 times the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension as early as 35 years with continued disparity at older ages. Black men had nearly double the prevalence of diastolic hypertension from 35 to 65 years and at least double the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension throughout the lifecourse with the widest disparities at 40 years. Disparities attenuated but remained statistically significant with adjustment for socioeconomic status.

Conclusions

Results suggest that isolated systolic hypertension is a dominant and important form of hypertension starting in midlife (~50–60 years); however, indicative of potential earlier arterial ageing, Black men and women's increased prevalence may start as early as 35 and 45 years, respectively.

### Hypertension and heart failure: a dysfunction of systole, diastole or both? [^114ED1XT]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The pathological myocardial hypertrophy associated with hypertension contains the seed for further maladaptive development. Increased myocardial oxygen consumption, impaired epicardial coronary perfusion, ventricular fibrosis and remodelling, abnormalities in long-axis function and torsion, cause, to a varying degree, a mixture of systolic and diastolic abnormalities. In addition, chronotropic incompetence and peripheral factors such as lack of vasodilator reserve and reduced arterial compliance further affect cardiac output particularly on exercise. Many of these factors are common to hypertensive heart failure with a normal ejection fraction as well as systolic heart failure. There is increasing evidence that these apparently separate phenotypes are part of a spectrum of heart failure differing only in the degree of ventricular remodelling and volume changes. Furthermore, dichotomizing heart failure into systolic and diastolic clinical entities has led to a paucity of clinical trials of therapies for heart failure with a normal ejection fraction. Therapies aimed at reversing myocardial fibrosis, and targets outside the heart such as enhancing vasodilator reserve and improving chronotropic incompetence deserve further study and may improve the exercise capacity of hypertensive heart failure patients. Hypertension heart disease with heart failure is simply not a dysfunction of systole and diastole. Other peripheral factors including heart rate and vasodilator response with exercise may deserve equal attention in an attempt to develop more effective treatments for this disorder.

### Cardiovascular mortality risk in young adults with isolated systolic hypertension: findings from population-based MONICA / KORA cohort study [^116Rq6nN]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is currently defined as an elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg, combined with a normal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mmHg. Consequentially of large artery stiffening and increase in pulse pressure, ISH is the most prevalent subtype of hypertension in the elderly. However, ISH also affects an estimated 2–8% of the younger indivuals by heterogeneous mechanisms. Nevertheless, whether ISH in the young (ISHY) implies a worse outcome and needs antihypertensive treatment remains debated.

The discussion of whether ISHY is clinically significant and needs to be treated stems from two lines of conflicting evidence. The "pro" argumentation indicates that ISHY is associated with concurrent risk factors such as obesity, smoking, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiological mechanism between ISHY and worsened health is attributed to hyperkinetic circulation leading to premature aortic stiffening, as supported by previous studies showing a predominantly elevated cardiac output, stroke volume and heart rate in participants with ISHY. Nevertheless, up to 2/3rd of participants in the aforementioned studies did not present hyperkinetic circulation, leading way for the heterogeneity associated with ISHY.

### A meta-analysis of the haemodynamics of primary hypertension in children and adults [^113huW2q]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) is determined by the product of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Thus, in hypertension, where MAP is usually elevated because of an increased systolic or diastolic blood pressure or both, this component of hypertension can be attributed to increased CO, increased SVR or both. Early studies measuring CO by the dye dilution method in adults with severe hypertension demonstrated reduced CO and increased SVR compared to normotensive individuals. Later studies in adults with established hypertension performed mainly in the 1980s confirmed these findings, with increased SVR (or SVR indexed to body surface area, SVRI) as the characteristic finding. This has led to the view that primary hypertension is predominantly a 'vascular' rather than 'cardiac' problem. However, in hypertensive children and in young adults with borderline and mild hypertension, a hyperkinetic circulatory state with raised CO has been described. A hyperkinetic state has also been described in adults with primary hypertension. In older individuals, raised systolic blood pressure and isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) have been attributed to increased aortic stiffness rather than increased SVR. Thus, the major haemodynamic alterations that contribute to the majority of cases of primary hypertension in the general population remain unknown.

In the present study, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies comparing measures of CO and SVR in patients with established hypertension with those in normotensive control individuals to determine whether primary hypertension is characterized predominantly by elevated CO or elevated SVR. Where available we also compare measures of aortic stiffness in hypertensive and normotensive individuals.

### Doppler tissue imaging reveals systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension and apparent "isolated" diastolic dysfunction [^113aWv7J]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine left ventricular systolic longitudinal contraction in patients with essential hypertension with normal ejection fraction and fractional shortening. We used tissue tracking and strain rate Doppler echocardiography to evaluate left ventricular longitudinal contraction in 40 patients with hypertension and 30 age-matched control patients. Tissue tracking and peak systolic strain rate were significantly decreased in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction compared with patients with hypertension and normal diastolic function or with control patients. In conclusion, patients with hypertension who, earlier, were considered to have isolated diastolic dysfunction were demonstrated to have reduced left ventricular systolic longitudinal function.

### Isolated systolic hypertension in young and middle-aged adults and 31-year risk for cardiovascular mortality: the Chicago heart association detection project in industry study [^111U4q2y]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg, in younger and middle-aged adults is increasing in prevalence.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with ISH in younger and middle-aged adults.

Methods

CVD risks were explored in 15,868 men and 11,213 women 18 to 49 years of age (mean age 34 years) at baseline, 85% non-Hispanic white, free of coronary heart disease (CHD) and antihypertensive therapy, from the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry study. Participant classifications were as follows: 1) optimal-normal blood pressure (BP) (SBP < 130 mm Hg and DBP < 85 mm Hg); 2) high-normal BP (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg); 3) ISH; 4) isolated diastolic hypertension (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg); and 5) systolic diastolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg).

Results

During a 31-year average follow-up period (842,600 person-years), there were 1,728 deaths from CVD, 1,168 from CHD, and 223 from stroke. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, race, education, body mass index, current smoking, total cholesterol, and diabetes. In men, with optimal-normal BP as the reference stratum, hazard ratios for CVD and CHD mortality risk for those with ISH were 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.46) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.58), respectively. ISH risks were similar to those with high-normal BP and less than those associated with isolated diastolic hypertension and systolic diastolic hypertension. In women with ISH, hazard ratios for CVD and CHD mortality risk were 1.55 (95% CI: 1.18 to 2.05) and 2.12 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.01), respectively. ISH risks were higher than in those with high-normal BP or isolated diastolic hypertension and less than those associated with systolic diastolic hypertension.

Conclusions

Over long-term follow-up, younger and middle-aged adults with ISH had higher relative risk for CVD and CHD mortality than those with optimal-normal BP.

### Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with midlife diastolic blood pressure and transition to late-life hypertensive phenotypes [^111TmSQX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In nearly 170 000 people, including more than 13 000 participants with repeated measurements over 4 to 9 years, there were strong associations between baseline SBP and DBP with arterial stiffness, with stronger associations for DBP than SBP. Midlife DBP was the strongest predictor of increases in arterial stiffness over time, while greater arterial stiffness was associated with increases in SBP. However, arterial stiffness was associated with an earlier age of transition to a falling DBP and was associated with the risk of transition to hypertension or elevated arterial stiffness during follow‐up.

The strong associations between arterial stiffness, hypertension, 6 a consistently rising SBP with age, and a parabolic relationship with DBP are well‐established. 23, 24 The demonstrated stronger relationship with future arterial stiffness for midlife steady components of BP contrasts with the prognostic importance of pulsatile BP components (isolated SBP, PP) in the elderly. 24, 25, 26 However, if both the midlife risk associated with increased DBP and the late‐life increase in pulsatile pressures are both ultimately caused by midlife hypertension, then principally targeting late‐life pulsatile BP is suboptimal. However, there have been relatively few studies directly measuring the associations between midlife BP and progression of arterial stiffness over prolonged periods, 9, 12, 13, 14 and none that we are aware of that directly compare midlife DBP with SBP and none that adequately assessed the effect of arterial stiffness on the age of transition to late‐life hypertensive phenotypes. 27, 28 Although a number of interventions to reduce arterial stiffness have been examined, 29, 30, 31 optimal prevention of late‐life harms may therefore depend on treating midlife factors that lead to arterial stiffening, before the transition to late‐life phenotypes.

### Racial disparities in hypertension subtype prevalence over the lifecourse: evidence of accelerated arterial ageing in a population representative cross-sectional study [^1153y3Gs]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Racially minoritised populations, particularly Black individuals, have been shown to have an earlier average age of onset of hypertension (elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure) compared with White individuals potentially due to 'weathering' or accelerated health declines due to the cumulative impact of marginalisation over the lifecourse. Systolic blood pressure is more reactive to stress, increases linearly with age indicative of arterial ageing and is more highly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality versus diastolic blood pressure. However, little research has examined racial differences in isolated systolic hypertension. This study examines the race/gender differences in the prevalence of two mutually exclusive manifestations of hypertension: diastolic hypertension (ie, elevated diastolic with or without elevated systolic blood pressure) and isolated systolic hypertension (increased systolic only) over the lifecourse.

Methods

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2016 to 2020, a US-based population representative cross-sectional study, was used in weighted multinomial logistic regression models to estimate age-specific prevalence of hypertension subtypes by race/gender subgroups controlling for socioeconomic status and anti-hypertensive use. Outcomes were diastolic (diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg with/without systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg) and isolated systolic (systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic < 90 mm Hg) hypertension.

Results

The prevalence of diastolic hypertension increased until midlife and then decreased with increasing age, while the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increased throughout the lifecourse. Black women had nearly triple the prevalence of diastolic hypertension from 20 to 45 years where the disparity lessens to double the prevalence and continues to lessen with increasing age and 2–3 times the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension as early as 35 years with continued disparity at older ages. Black men had nearly double the prevalence of diastolic hypertension from 35 to 65 years and at least double the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension throughout the lifecourse with the widest disparities at 40 years. Disparities attenuated but remained statistically significant with adjustment for socioeconomic status.

Conclusions

Results suggest that isolated systolic hypertension is a dominant and important form of hypertension starting in midlife (~50–60 years); however, indicative of potential earlier arterial ageing, Black men and women's increased prevalence may start as early as 35 and 45 years, respectively.

### Prevalence, time-trends and clinical characteristics of hypertension in young adults: nationwide cross-sectional study of 1.7 million Swedish 18-year-olds, 1969–2010 [^114yaCxq]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of hypertension in young adulthood, as well as the clinical characteristics associated with different hypertension subtypes, have been inconsistently described. Our aim was to assess the prevalence, time-trends and characteristics associated with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension and combined systodiastolic hypertension.

Methods

Serial cross-sectional analysis, using data from the Swedish conscription registry, including 1701 314 (99.2% male) individuals from 1969 to 2010. Risk factor associations were assessed through multivariable logistic regression.

Results

The prevalence of hypertension increased progressively during the study period, from 20.4% in 1969 to 29.3% in 2010, with ISH being the most common subtype (94.3%). ISH was associated with elevated resting heart rate (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.84–1.86, per SD), increased exercise capacity (1.37, 1.36–1.39) and increased BMI (1.30, 1.29–1.31). Isolated diastolic hypertension and combined hypertension were also associated with elevated resting heart rate (1.37, 1.32–1.41 and 2.05, 1.99–2.11, respectively) and more strongly associated with increased BMI (1.36, 1.33–1.40 and 1.54, 1.51–1.58), but inversely associated with exercise capacity (0.79, 0.75–0.83 and 0.90, 0.86–0.95).

Conclusion

The prevalence of hypertension in young adulthood has increased substantially over time, predominantly due to an increase in ISH. Risk factor patterns differed between ISH and other forms of hypertension, suggesting potentially different underlying mechanisms.

Results

Characteristics of Participants

The study sample analyzed (n = 11 135) included 5494 women (49.3%) and consisted of 6929 White Europeans (62.2%), 1887 Asians (17.0%), and 2319 South Americans (20.8%). The median age at baseline was 54.7 years. Study participants included 3022 (27.3%) smokers, 849 (7.6%) diabetics, and 1291 (11.6%) persons with a history of cardiovascular disease.

When applying the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension criteria using 24-hour ambulatory BP thresholds, our sample comprised of 5418 (48.7%) participants with normal BP values, 1129 (10.1%) with BP values meeting criteria for IDH, 1325 (11.9%) with BP values meeting criteria for ISH, and 3263 (29.3%) with combined systolic-diastolic hypertension (Table 1). In comparison to those with normal BP values, persons with IDH by ACC/AHA criteria were numerically more likely to be South American and male. Otherwise, the baseline characteristics of normotensive participants and those with IDH appeared similar, as summarized in Table 1.

### Nocturnal systolic hypertension and adverse prognosis in patients with CKD [^113PdCTk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Nocturnal hypertension is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with CKD. However, the individual association of entities of nocturnal hypertension according to achievement of systolic and/or diastolic BP goals with kidney failure and cardiovascular outcomes of CKD is not clear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Our study analyzed data from participants in the Chinese Cohort Study of Chronic Kidney Disease. Nocturnal hypertension was categorized into three entities: isolated nocturnal diastolic hypertension with diastolic BP ≥ 70 mm Hg and systolic BP < 120 mm Hg, isolated nocturnal systolic hypertension with systolic BP ≥ 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 70 mm Hg, and nocturnal systolic-diastolic hypertension with both systolic BP ≥ 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 70 mm Hg. Associations of nocturnal hypertension entities with kidney failure and cardiovascular outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression.

Results

In total, 2024 patients with CKD stages 1–4 were included in our analysis (mean age, 49 ± 14 years; 57% men; eGFR = 51 ± 29 ml/min per 1.73 m 2; proteinuria: 0.9 [0.4–2.1] g/d). Among them, 1484 (73%) patients had nocturnal hypertension, with the proportions of 26%, 8%, and 66% for isolated nocturnal diastolic hypertension, isolated nocturnal systolic hypertension, and nocturnal systolic-diastolic hypertension, respectively. Three hundred twenty kidney events and 148 cardiovascular events were recorded during median follow-up intervals of 4.8 and 5.0 years for kidney and cardiovascular events, respectively. After adjustment, isolated nocturnal systolic hypertension was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 6.23). Nocturnal systolic-diastolic hypertension showed a higher risk for both kidney failure (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 2.49) and cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 3.86). No association was observed between isolated nocturnal diastolic hypertension with either kidney failure or cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Nocturnal systolic hypertension, either alone or in combination with diastolic hypertension, is associated with higher risks for adverse outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Guidelines on guidelines: focus on isolated systolic hypertension in youth [^111qptrx]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Current guidelines on isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) suggest the same treatment to patients of all ages. Application of these guidelines in youth with ISH may not be appropriate, as presently no data show adverse outcome or benefit of drug therapy in this group. Simple noninvasive tonometric techniques now enable physicians to measure the central aortic pressure waveform and amplification of the pressure pulse. ISH in youth is usually caused by high amplification of the central pressure wave, whereas ISH in the elderly (> age 60) is attributable to aortic stiffening. This is the only group with ISH shown to have an adverse prognosis and to warrant drug therapy.

### Age-dependent associations between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension: importance of discriminating between systolic / diastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension in the sleep heart health study [^116QoYpH]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with hypertension in the middle-aged. The association is less clear in older persons. Most middle-aged hypertensives have systolic/diastolic hypertension, whereas isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is common among persons over 60 years. Mechanistically, only systolic/diastolic hypertension is expected to be associated with SDB, but few studies of SDB and hypertension distinguish systolic/diastolic hypertension from ISH. Prior investigations may have underestimated an association between SDB and systolic/diastolic hypertension in the elderly by categorizing individuals with ISH as simply hypertensive.

Methods and Results

We conducted cross-sectional analyses of 6120 participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study, stratified by age: 40 to 59 (n = 2477) and ≥ 60 years. Outcome measures included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; average number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep), systolic/diastolic hypertension (≥ 140 and ≥ 90 mm Hg), and ISH (≥ 140 and < 90 mm Hg). With adjustment for covariates, ISH was not associated with SDB in either age category. In those aged < 60 years, AHI was significantly associated with higher odds of systolic/diastolic hypertension (AHI 15 to 29.9, OR = 2.38 [95% CI 1.30 to 4.38]; AHI ≥ 30, OR = 2.24 [95% CI 1.10 to 4.54]). Among those aged ≥ 60 years, no adjusted association between AHI and systolic/diastolic hypertension was found.

Conclusions

SDB is associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension in those aged < 60 years. No association was found between SDB and systolic/diastolic hypertension in those aged ≥ 60 years or between SDB and ISH in either age category. These findings have implications for SDB screening and treatment. Distinguishing between hypertensive subtypes reveals a stronger association between SDB and hypertension for those aged < 60 years than previously reported.

### Diastolic blood pressure J-curve phenomenon in a tertiary-care hypertension clinic [^113JiZSK]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical importance of the role of diastolic J curve, if present, continues to be a matter of debate primarily because of the conflicting reports noted above and focus on intensive BP lowering in recent guidelines. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend a DBP target of < 80 mm Hg in only those without established coronary heart disease. Currently, < 50% of patients treated for hypertension achieve a target office SBP < 140 mm Hg; however, with the new guidelines emphasizing a greater focus on lower target BP, more clarity is required on the risks of the diastolic J curve, if present.

The key objective of the present study was to study the associations of on-treatment office DBP measured during a 5-year period on cause-specific cardiovascular hospital admissions and mortality during a 30-year follow-up period in a real-life hypertensive cohort.

### Prevalence of isolated uncontrolled systolic blood pressure among treated hypertensive patients in primary care in Belgium: results of the I-inSYST survey [^112Hou3T]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of isolated uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (on-treatment isolated systolic hypertension) in treated hypertensive patients and identify the characteristics and treatment strategy in these patients.

Methods

Prospective cross-sectional survey in primary care. Participating physicians enrolled more than 13 consecutive treated hypertensive patients. Patients were considered to have isolated systolic hypertension when systolic blood pressure was at least 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mmHg.

Results

On-treatment isolated systolic hypertension occurred in 28% of evaluable patients (n = 11562) and in 36% of uncontrolled patients (n = 9080). Among the isolated systolic hypertension and among other uncontrolled patients, 53% and 47%, respectively, used more than one antihypertensive drug class. beta-Blockers were the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Patients with isolated uncontrolled systolic blood pressure were more frequently treated with diuretics (43 vs. 39%) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (23 vs. 17%). Despite blood pressure being under control in only 21% of the patients, hypertension treatment was not changed in 46% of patients with isolated uncontrolled systolic blood presssure vs. 14% of patients with both uncontrolled systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusion

In Belgium, the prevalence of on-treatment isolated systolic hypertension in treated hypertensive patients, was 28%. The goal blood pressure was likely not reached in most patients due to inadequate treatment. The overall control rate was worse for systolic than for diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, antihypertensive treatment was less frequently adapted in patients with isolated uncontrolled systolic blood pressure than in those patients with both uncontrolled systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Subgroup Analysis

As presented in Figure 3, the analysis of isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, individuals with high systolic and diastolic hypertension, controlled, and uncontrolled hypertension showed that the risk of diabetes (HR [95% CI] was 1.95 [1.26–3.02], 2.21 [1.60–3.06], 2.24 [1.72–2.92], 2.57 [1.92–3.45], and 2.35 [95% CI, 1.77–3.12], respectively) in the HTAS group was elevated significantly. For the individuals of isolated systolic hypertension, high systolic and diastolic hypertension, and controlled, the difference of IVF and HTNAS did not reach statistical significance.

### Association between isolated diastolic hypertension defined by the 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure guideline and incident CVD… [^115mtmxK]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

All comparisons are vs ARIC Study participants with normal blood pressure. Hypertension can be diagnosed on the basis of elevated systolic blood pressure, elevated diastolic BP, or both. 1, 2 The 2017 BP guideline published by the American College of Cardiology /American Heart Association altered the definition of hypertension from a cutoff of greater than. This change has major implications for an entity known as isolated diastolic hypertension, defined as a systolic BP less than 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg by new criteria, 1 but a systolic BP less. than 140 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg by the JNC7 criteria.

3 Prior studies suggest that IDH is more common in younger individuals, is associated with future systolic hypertension, but is generally not associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes independently of baseline systolic BP. 4–14. In all 3 cohorts, we defined IDH as a systolic BP less than 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg by 2017 ACC/AHA criteria1 and a systolic BP less than 140 mm Hg with a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg by JNC7 criteria.
3. The estimated prevalence of IDH in the NHANES can be applied to 2016 US Census data to approximate the corresponding numbers of adults with this diagnosis. Because hypertension is defined on the basis of either a systolic BP greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg or a diastolic BP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg, 1 the 5. 2% higher prevalence of IDH in the US population translated into an estimated

### Prognosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension as assessed by self-measurement of blood pressure at home… [^117MoNsW]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

THE DIAGNOSIS of hypertension is usually based on blood pressure criteria for both systolic and diastolic BP. 1, 2 However, some subjects fulfill only the SBP or only the DBP criteria. These subjects are categorized as having isolated systolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension. We classified the subjects into 4 groups according to their home BP levels as follows: systolic-diastolic hypertension: SBP, 137 mm Hg or higher and DBP, 84 mm Hg or higher; ISH: SBP, 137 mm Hg or higher and DBP, lower than 84 mm Hg; IDH: SBP, lower than 137 mm Hg and DBP, 84 mm Hg or higher; and normotension: SBP, lower than 137 mm Hg and DBP, lower than 84 mm Hg. mm Hg), while mean DBPs were higher in subjects with SDH and subjects with IDH than in subjects with ISH and subjects with NT.

We investigated the relationship between the type of hypertension and CVD mortality among the entire study population. Cardiovascular disease death rates per 100 person-years were higher in subjects with SDH or ISH than in subjects with NT or IDH. Only 2 other studies have investigated IDH as a risk factor for CVD. Fang et al7 followed up 1560 middle-aged subjects with diastolic hypertension, and demonstrated that the risk of acute myocardial infarction was significantly higher in subjects with SDH than in those with IDH. 7 Petrovitch et al8 followed up 7590 Japanese-American men among the general population of. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in subjects with IDH than in subjects with NT; however, PP was somewhat lower in subjects with IDH, although the risks of CVD mortality were no different.

Similarly, the CVD mortality risk was somewhat higher in subjects with ISH than in subjects with SDH, although SBP in ISH was similar to that in SDH.

### On-treatment diastolic blood pressure and prognosis in systolic hypertension… [^117Lg8Ku]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

At each 3-month visit, BP was measured twice with the patient sitting and the 2 BP measurements were averaged. These values were, respectively, 78. 8 ±
6. 0 mm Hg and 83. 6 ±
6. 4 mm Hg for diastolic BP. Table 2 gives the distribution of mean diastolic BP and of all diastolic BP measurements in the 2 groups. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 randomized clinical trials involving 40 233 persons with primarily systolic-diastolic hypertension, 4–10 a J-curve relationship was observed between diastolic BP and the risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality in both treated and untreated patients. 3 The authors concluded that the increased risk observed in patients with low BP was not related to antihypertensive treatment and could probably be explained by poor health conditions.

The SHEP investigators concluded that lower achieved diastolic BP was associated with increased risk of CHD, stroke, and cardiovascular disease in actively treated patients; thus, some patients may have been overtreated. 15 The relative risk for the combined cardiovascular events became significant for diastolic BP less than 70 mm Hg and approached a 2-fold increase in risk for diastolic BP less than 55 mm Hg. An unexpected observation in the placebo group was that low diastolic BP was associated with a higher incidence of cerebrovascular events and not of CHD. However, the former finding agrees with the pooled analysis of 9 epidemiologic studies in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in which an inverse relationship between stroke mortality and diastolic BP was observed.

22 That lower diastolic BP was not associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events during active treatment in the Syst-Eur Trial is compatible with a greater reduction in stroke risk23 and a greater decrease in carotid intima-media thickness24 with regimens based on calcium channel blockers than with other regimens. The risk of low diastolic BP could be greatest for CHD events, particularly in patients with evidence of CHD at baseline. Whereas we observed an increased risk for an aggregate of cardiovascular events at low diastolic BP in patients with evidence of CHD at baseline, a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed for incident CHD, related to the small number of events and the limited power of the analysis.

### Systolic, diastolic, and combined hypertension… [^1176FTi7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We used a classification system of systolic, diastolic, and combined hypertension to ascertain whether there were significant differences between the groups. The study involved 182 consecutive outpatients for whom no secondary cause of hypertension could be found. There were 96 male and 86 female patients, with a mean age of 45. 8 years. There were significant differences in age, with the systolic group being the oldest and the diastolic group the youngest. There were also differences in the prevalence of complications among the categories. Peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, and coronary artery disease were more prevalent in the systolic and combined groups, while diabetes was more prevalent in the systolic group. We conclude that there appear to be clinical differences between systolic, diastolic, and combined hypertension with respect to presenting characteristics and complications. Ferguson JJ, Randall OS.
