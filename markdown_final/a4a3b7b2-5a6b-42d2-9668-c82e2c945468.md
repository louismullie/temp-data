## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step obstetric triage history and physical examination framework, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that distinguish obstetric triage from general ED triage. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities and timing targets. Next, I will review the focused history elements and how they map to acuity. After that, I need to check the physical examination components, including maternal vitals adapted for pregnancy and fetal assessment. Then, I will examine acuity stratification tools and their validation. Finally, I should confirm immediate actions, documentation, reassessment triggers, and special populations, and close with quality metrics and system-level considerations [^113gw284].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles that make obstetric triage unique: it must simultaneously assess the pregnant patient, the fetus, and labor status, and it must use pregnancy-adapted vital sign parameters rather than generic adult ranges; critically, it must be acuity-based rather than first-come, first-served to mitigate the third delay and improve outcomes, especially in high-volume or resource-limited settings [^113gw284] [^112PSDnr] [^116jd8p8].

> I need to ensure the initial assessment is rapid and standardized; AWHONN and UK guidance converge on an initial evaluation within about 10–15 minutes of arrival, with some programs achieving a 5-minute target for first contact and vitals, so I should set a 5–15 minute window and escalate if breached; this early step determines whether the patient is "sick or not sick" and "labor or no labor", which drives disposition and resource allocation [^113Hk1W1] [^115jyj24] [^116kHzaV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about where this happens; I should confirm the physical space and staffing model: a two-stage process with a rapid assessment area followed by a dedicated triage room improves flow, reduces blocking of beds, and supports consistent documentation and handoffs; dedicated triage nurses and clear escalation pathways are essential to sustain performance [^116GZBVJ] [^115jyj24] [^114M7LCL].

> Next, I will review the focused history elements I must capture in those first minutes: last menstrual period and estimated gestational age, chief complaint with onset and trajectory, obstetric history (parity, prior cesarean, postpartum hemorrhage, prior preterm birth, ectopic), medical and surgical history including cardiac disease, current medications and allergies, and social determinants such as language barriers and support at home; I should double-check that I explicitly ask about pregnancy status in all reproductive-age patients because pregnancy may not be obvious and changes management entirely [^111449jt].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom red flags that mandate immediate escalation: severe headache with visual changes suggesting preeclampsia with severe features, chest pain or dyspnea raising concern for thromboembolism or peripartum cardiomyopathy, syncope suggesting hemorrhage or pulmonary embolism, and fever with maternal tachycardia concerning for sepsis; I should also ask about decreased fetal movement, rupture of membranes, and regular contractions to separate labor from other urgent conditions [^111449jt] [^112xv97i] [^113N6fUh].

> I will now examine the maternal physical assessment with pregnancy-adapted parameters: baseline vitals in pregnancy typically show a higher resting heart rate, lower blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate, so I need to interpret deviations in that context; I should confirm that a heart rate above 100–110 bpm, systolic BP at or above 140 mmHg, or diastolic BP at or above 90 mmHg trigger concern for sepsis or hypertensive disorders, and I must assess for orthostatic changes if bleeding is suspected; temperature, oxygen saturation, and mental status complete the initial screen [^117QyyEY] [^113gw284].

> Let me consider the obstetric and abdominal examination next: I should inspect for pallor, jaundice, edema, and gravid uterine size, palpate for uterine tenderness, rigidity, or contractions, and auscultate fetal heart tones if the fetus is viable; if membranes are suspected to be ruptured, I should avoid digital cervical examination unless delivery is imminent to reduce infection risk; fundal height helps corroborate gestational age and fetal growth, and I should document any abnormal findings immediately [^1172PSpw].

> But wait, what if the patient is early first trimester and the location of pregnancy is unknown; I should confirm that transvaginal ultrasound is indicated when β-hCG is below the discriminatory threshold in symptomatic patients, because ruling out ectopic pregnancy is time-critical; bedside ultrasound by trained emergency physicians has high sensitivity for detecting an intrauterine pregnancy and can expedite care when used appropriately [^115hziUB] [^112o25XN] [^111pyVKN].

> Next, I should review acuity stratification tools and their evidence base; validated obstetric triage systems such as OTAS, MFTI, BSOTS, and GOTS use 4–5 tiers and integrate chief complaint, maternal vitals, and fetal status, with escalation to the higher acuity when discordant; I need to ensure the tool I use is locally adapted, embedded with initial management prompts, and supported by training to minimize over- and undertriage [^1151WF7U] [^113gw284] [^11345UN2].

> Hold on, I should verify reliability and validity data before I commit to a specific tool: OTAS demonstrates substantial interrater reliability and improved flow metrics, GOTS shows good agreement and includes embedded management steps, and BSOTS has excellent inter-operator reliability; importantly, construct validation remains challenging without a gold standard, so expert consensus on immediate interventions can serve as surrogate outcome measures for acuity at triage [^1151WF7U] [^113cMa6D] [^11547hZz].

> I will now examine immediate actions tied to acuity: Level 1 (red) requires immediate bedside evaluation, continuous fetal monitoring if viable, IV access, stat labs including CBC, type and screen, and targeted tests such as fibrinogen for hemorrhage or LFTs for HELLP; Level 2 (orange) mandates evaluation within 15–30 minutes with focused testing; Level 3 (yellow) within 60 minutes; Level 4 (green/white) within 120 minutes; I should double-check that these timelines align with local benchmarks and staffing realities [^115jyj24] [^113Hk1W1] [^112ey7fn].

> Let me first confirm the documentation and communication standards: a standardized triage form capturing acuity, vitals, fetal status, chief complaint, and initial orders supports handoffs and quality review; color-coded wristbands or visual cues can cue staff to acuity, and explicit escalation triggers for breaches in time targets should be built into the workflow; I need to ensure the form prompts reassessment intervals and disposition plans [^115jyj24] [^114b4xT6].

> Next, I should review reassessment triggers and disposition pathways: any change in pain, bleeding, vital signs, or fetal status warrants re-triage; patients may be discharged with return precautions, admitted to antepartum or labor units, or transferred to higher-acuity centers per regionalized maternal care; for facilities without inpatient obstetrics, I must stabilize and arrange timely transfer to the appropriate level center based on gestational age and acuity [^117U5Ki3] [^111xVzv7].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed: in early pregnancy, I should maintain a high suspicion for ectopic pregnancy and use ultrasound and β-hCG thoughtfully; in trauma, I should apply the > 20 weeks pregnancy field triage criterion and transport to centers with obstetric capabilities; in suspected sepsis, I should use obstetric-specific screening and initiate early antibiotics and source control; in cardiovascular complaints, I should obtain a focused pregnancy and cardiac history and use standardized risk tools to avoid missed peripartum cardiomyopathy or coronary dissection [^1167dXUT] [^112xv97i] [^111449jt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "left lateral decubitus for all third-trimester patients", but I should correct that: left lateral tilt or manual displacement of the gravid uterus is indicated for hypotension or shock to relieve aortocaval compression, not for all patients; I also need to remember that in active vaginal bleeding, avoid digital cervical examination unless there is a prolapsed cord or imminent breech delivery, to reduce infection and bleeding risk [^113N6fUh].

> I should double-check quality metrics that reflect safety and efficiency: time to initial assessment, time to provider evaluation, total length of stay, acuity-based care proportion, and documentation completeness are core measures; programs report reductions in median wait times from 40–240 minutes down to 5–60 minutes after implementing standardized acuity-based triage, with sustained gains when coupled with training, leadership buy-in, and iterative QI cycles [^112LRBcK] [^112wKX1k].

> Let me reconsider system-level enablers: validated acuity tools, dedicated triage space and staffing, standardized forms, and multidisciplinary training are necessary but insufficient without leadership support and continuous measurement; embedding champions, using PDSA cycles, and aligning with regional maternal transport networks ensure reliability and resilience, especially when scaling to new settings or resource-limited environments [^117U5Ki3] [^112hAHre].

> In summary, I need to ensure the obstetric triage H&P remains rapid, standardized, and acuity-driven: within 5–15 minutes, obtain a pregnancy-aware history, perform adapted vitals and a focused obstetric exam including fetal assessment, assign an evidence-based acuity tier, initiate condition-specific actions and documentation, and build in reassessment and escalation triggers; this approach reduces delays, improves maternal-fetal safety, and is adaptable across settings when supported by training, tools, and leadership [^113gw284].

The obstetric triage history and physical is a **rapid, structured assessment** [^112PSDnr] that prioritizes maternal-fetal safety by identifying high-acuity conditions and guiding timely intervention [^113gw284]. It should be completed within **10–15 minutes** [^113Hk1W1] and includes:

- **Chief complaint**: contractions, bleeding, decreased fetal movement, hypertension, trauma, infection, or other concerns [^11345UN2].
- **Obstetric history**: gravida/para, gestational age, prior cesarean, preterm birth, postpartum hemorrhage, hypertension, diabetes, infertility treatment, and current prenatal care [^notfound].
- **Medical/surgical history**: cardiac, renal, autoimmune, thrombosis, prior surgeries [^notfound].
- **Current medications/allergies**: including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and substances [^notfound].
- **Vital signs**: BP, HR, RR, temp, SpO2, with pregnancy-adapted thresholds [^117QyyEY].
- **Physical exam**: general appearance, uterine size/tenderness/contractions, fetal lie/presentation, fetal heart rate, and sterile speculum/digital exam if indicated [^1172PSpw].
- **Fetal assessment**: fetal heart tones, movement, and estimated gestational age [^notfound].

This approach ensures **early detection of emergencies** such as preeclampsia, hemorrhage, infection, and fetal compromise, enabling rapid escalation and appropriate care pathways [^112xv97i] [^117U5Ki3].

### Committee opinion no. 667 summary: hospital-based triage of obstetric patients [^111CBkuL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Emergency departments typically have structured triage guidelines for health care providers encountering the diverse cases that may present to their units. Such guidelines aid in determining which patients must be evaluated promptly and which may wait safely, and aid in determining anticipated use of resources. Although labor and delivery units frequently serve as emergency units for pregnant women, the appropriate structure, location, timing, and timeliness for hospital-based triage evaluations of obstetric patients are not always clear. Hospital-based obstetric units are urged to collaborate with emergency departments and hospital ancillary services, as well as emergency response systems outside of the hospital, to establish guidelines for triage of pregnant women. Recently developed, validated obstetric triage acuity tools may improve quality and efficiency of care and guide resource use, and they could serve as a template for use in individual hospital obstetric units.

It asks whether the emergency physician should obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold; in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy; and, in patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for emergency department management. Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^1156uyUG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triage aims at identifying and prioritising patients with urgent or acute conditions, enabling timely interventions in order to improve clinical outcome or prevent deterioration in patients seeking emergency care. The concept of emergency triage is relatively new in obstetric emergency care. Currently, there are approximately ten different obstetric triage systems (OTSs) worldwide. OTSs differ from other triage systems as they are adapted to physiological changes during pregnancy as well as pregnancy-related and pregnancy-specific complaints. Moreover, OTSs not only evaluate the pregnant woman, but also the fetus and labour status. These characteristics, such as applying the use of adapted vital sign parameters, are a prerequisite for correct and safe prioritisation of obstetric emergency patients. Applying non-OTSs in the initial assessment of obstetric patients seeking emergency have been shown to threaten patient safety.

Although triage is imperative in emergency care, a standard for validating triage systems remains to be established. This impedes assessment of both external and internal validity. The systems' true ability to identify patients with urgent medical conditions is consequently unknown.

Triage process

The triage process is supported by structured triage systems and is successful if the required intervention is provided in a timely manner. Despite the extensive use of triage systems in both non-obstetric and obstetric clinical practice, there are surprisingly few studies evaluating their performance, thereby resulting in limited scientific evidence and an unclear effect on patient outcome. Nevertheless, triage is deemed crucial for prioritisation according to medical urgency level and thus for ensuring patient safety. It is also essential to manage the everlasting challenge of overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs), facilitating allocation of limited resources.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^112PSDnr]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Available knowledge

Obstetric triage has emerged as one of the most significant perinatal service innovations in the last 15 years. Due to physiological, social, and emotional changes, pregnant patients are considered as one of the most vulnerable populations in the healthcare spectrum. Assessment in triage not only affects the initial evaluation of labouring or non-labouring patient, but also determines the direction and timing of further obstetric care. The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) describes obstetric triage as 'the brief, thorough and systematic, maternal and fetal assessment performed when a pregnant woman presents for care, to determine priority for full evaluation'.

It is vital for hospitals and healthcare facilities to provide the best individual care for this population and to prevent adverse events and complications. Obstetric triage, as observed in high resource countries, enabled better triage utilisation with improved maternal and fetal assessment. However, in a systematic review addressing critical care in lower- middle- income countries (LMICs), Bakerhighlighted emergency care provision and triage as the weakest components of the health system and emphasised that improvement in these areas can be lifesaving and costeffective. In commonly practised obstetric triaging in LMICs, patients are seen on the first come first serve basis. This may result in leaving patients without initial evaluation and delayed delivery of necessary care to the one who need it on priority. The most significant problems associated with traditional triage are patient dissatisfaction, extended wait times, and increased morbidity and mortality.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^116p7Azj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Commonly used measures, such as resource utilisation and LOS in the ED imply a predictive ability of the triage system. However, predicting outcomes is not a triage system's primary aim. If the treatment/intervention following an accurate triage process is successful, the patient may not require admission and mortality may be avoided. Therefore, outcome measures must, as far as possible, reflect the degree of urgency in immediate or closest proximity to the time of triage. With clinically relevant outcome measures differentiated into three levels of urgency, a validation of an OTS will presumably have a higher likelihood of evaluating the OTS's ability to discriminate patients into different levels of acuity. Only when assured that a triage system is valid can patient safety be warranted. Likewise, only then may outcome measures related to planning resource utilisation and costs at the organisational level be of interest. To apply a triage system predictively, its validity must be addressed with the question "Are we identifying the right patients?" If not, organisational planning is likely to be based on irrelevant information.

Ideally, a set of outcome measures would be applicable for every OTS and clinical setting. This study presents a modified Delphi process identifying a set of outcome measures for obstetric triage, influenced to a limited extent by external factors. The outcome measures were adapted to the currently implemented OTS as it specifies initial treatment and interventions such as laboratory investigations. In addition, the outcome measures do not include vital sign parameters as these are an integrated part of the OTS itself. Vital sign parameters are fundamental in triaging obstetric patients and should be used as a part of the triage process itself, not as an outcome measure. Nevertheless, by visualising the process and the outcome measures themselves, the latter may be used as a reference standard or template for comparative studies of OTSs implemented in similar contexts.

Every ED has its local conditions and different OTSs may include or exclude initial management steps, careful assessment of whether the outcome measures are applicable in each setting is necessary. Otherwise, we propose that a similar process of establishing acuity outcome measures should be undertaken when an OTS is implemented in a new setting, enabling meaningful validation.

### Triage versus obstetric emergency department and main emergency department: best practices [^116CGUNZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

An obstetric emergency department (OBED) allows for timely, standardized and quality care by a clinician for pregnant patients presenting unscheduled to a hospital. Understanding the differences between a traditional labor and delivery triage model and an OBED are important in developing a successful, safe, and quality obstetric program that meets the needs of the community with appropriate resource allocation. The benefits in an OBED of every patient seen in a timely fashion by a clinician, and ultimately the impact on outcomes are noteworthy and should be considered when developing a labor and delivery unit.

Appendix C — Likelihood ratios (LR) and number needed to treat (NNT) — categorizes LR thresholds with paired LR(+) and LR(−) values and interpretations as follows: "1.0 1.0 Useless"; "1–5 0.5–1 Rarely of value, only minimally changes pretest probability"; "10 0.1 Worthwhile test, may be diagnostic if the result is concordant with pretest probability"; "20 0.05 Strong test, usually diagnostic"; and "100 0.01 Very accurate test, almost always diagnostic even in the setting of low or high pretest probability". NNT is defined as "Number needed to treat (NNT): number of patients who need to be treated to achieve 1 additional good outcome; NNT = 1/absolute risk reduction×100, where absolute risk reduction is the risk difference between 2 event rates (ie, experimental and control groups)".

### Obstetric and fetal triage [^113gw284]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Triage in healthcare is sorting patients by acuity to prioritize them for full evaluation. Standardizing this process with the use of triage acuity classification tools has been shown to improve patient flow and quality of care in the emergency department. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women be triaged based on acuity, rather than time of arrival, and that obstetric triage acuity scales can serve as templates for use at the facility level. Three obstetric triage acuity scales developed in North America are reviewed and the implementation of one in a system with 40 birth hospitals is described. Use of obstetric triage acuity scales resulted in timelier initial assessment and decreased wait times. Acuity, volume, and trends data helped improve nurse and provider staffing in triage units. These findings support the promise of obstetric triage acuity scales to promote efficient care.

Obstetric risk factor assessment — initial evaluation — emphasizes that many conditions can adversely impact the outcome of a pregnancy, potentially placing the patient and fetus at risk for complications, and as part of the initial evaluation, the primary obstetric provider must assess for certain risk factors early in the pregnancy because interventions, monitoring, and education throughout the pregnancy can have a positive impact on outcomes.

### The design and implementation of an obstetric triage system for unscheduled pregnancy related attendances: a mixed methods evaluation [^117QyyEY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Triage systems ensure that patients receive the level of care appropriate to their clinical priority, and that resources are used effectively. Such systems are common in Emergency Medicine Departments with many based on the Manchester Triage System (MTS), launched in the UK in 1997. The MTS is designed to standardise assessment and increase reproducibility and validity and has been mandated for use in UK Accident and Emergency Departments since 2002.

In maternity care, triage of pregnant women is less reliable, and the need to develop specific guidelines and education packages has been identified, with limited evidence of such a system being implemented and evaluated in the UK. Failure to identify and treat women with unscheduled pregnancy-related attendances has resulted in adverse outcomes.

The physiological changes associated with pregnancy mean the general parameters of standard triage tools may not be applicable, as pregnancy is associated with an increased resting heart rate, lower blood pressure and increased respiratory rate in the mother. This together with the underlying good health of the maternity population may mask the severity of maternal illness unless a specific assessment is undertaken by appropriately trained health care professionals. There is also no means of assessing the condition of the unborn baby in existing triage tools.

The maternity unit which was the main site of this study has approximately 8000 births annually and some 1200 women attend the Triage Department each month. An initial audit of the triage department identified delays in the assessment and treatment of women, and variation in the observations and investigations undertaken during the initial assessment and subsequent care of the women. Women would wait to be seen in the order in which they attended, and while informal triaging would be undertaken for those in obvious need of urgent attention, the remaining women would wait for varying amounts of time depending on the work load and staffing levels. Women stayed in the same room and were cared for by the same midwife (one to one care) throughout the care episode, which potentially led to 'blocking' of rooms by women with low levels of clinical urgency.

The midwives had expressed concerns about patient safety and workload and there was commitment in the team to change how the Department functioned.

This paper reports the development, implementation and initial evaluation of a standard Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage System (BSOTS) for the assessment of women attending a large maternity unit for unscheduled pregnancy related reasons. The BSOTS was designed to improve safety and standardise care.

PDSA cycle 1

Our initial intervention was to create a designated area for rapid assessment and prioritisation of pregnant patients presenting in L&D triage. Despite a space constraint, the team decided to make more efficient use of the available area. This was achieved by introducing relevant changes in the existing structure of L&D, a smaller area was created next to the unit receptionist counter called labour triage area for the initial brief assessment and priority evaluation. For a more detailed assessment of pregnant women, three beds were used in the existing labour triage room. These areas were equipped accordingly. Subsequently, pamphlets for the triage prioritisation tool were also posted in the triage area. This structural change allowed patients to be evaluated in two stages and improved triage fluidity. Due to high patients' census, a work plan was also proposed for expansion of the L&D area for further improvement.

PDSA cycle 6

After five PDSA cycles, a new triage flow process was developed with defined timelines. The process steps were planned in the following sequence. On arrival, the patient reporting at triage, will be greeted by the nurse. The assessment of patients in the triage will take place in two stages. Within 5 min of arrival, assigned nurse will approach the patient in the L&D triage area for initial brief assessment. The area nurse will inquire for a brief history, infectious screening, fetal movements, and uterine contractions. The initial evaluation will include vital signs and fetal heart sounds assessment. The case will be prioritised in accordance with the acuity tool. These findings will be documented on the triage assessment form. This form shall be a comprehensive document consisting of obstetric acuity and infectious screening tool and hands off component. Triage area assigned nurse will hand over the patient to the assigned nurse of triage assessment room and the patient will be shifted there for further nursing and obstetric assessment by physicians. Triage room nurse will check the order set for completion of care process.

For unwell women fulfilling level 1 criteria of the obstetric acuity tool, labour room consultant will be immediately involved. After quick assessment in the triage area, patient will be directly transferred to labour room or operation theatre for further management including delivery. Pregnant patients presenting with other acuity categories will be managed according to the defined care process. To improve turnover, reassessment and disposition process will be performed according to the defined flow process in the new triage guideline.

L&D team leader will be contacted for help in case of unavailability of bed and for the women waiting longer than 15 min in triage. It will be the responsibility of the unit receptionist to keep a record of arrival and triage times for each woman, and in case of target time breach, he/she will activate the escalation by paging team leader. Nursing lead will also have the responsibility to investigate and respond to any patient feedback regarding triage flow and care process. They will be supported by the on-floor labour room consultant and physicians in the smooth triage process.

Emergency department early pregnancy evaluation — prevalence and bedside ultrasound screening: In symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients, the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy is as high as 13% in some series. A recent meta-analysis found that bedside ultrasound performed by emergency physicians can be used as a screening tool for ectopic pregnancy, with pooled analysis including 10 studies and a total of 2,052 patients with 152 ectopic pregnancies; of those with ectopic pregnancy, 99.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.6% to 100%) had no intrauterine pregnancy identified on bedside ultrasound.

### National guideline for the field triage of injured patients: recommendations of the national expert panel on field triage, 2021 [^1167dXUT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Retained Criteria (No Changes)

Retained criterion: Pregnancy > 20 weeks

Rationale: The pregnancy criterion was added to the 1999 guidelineand refined to "pregnancy > 20 weeks" in 2006. While pregnancy does not necessarily increase the likelihood of serious injury, simultaneous management of the mother and unborn child can create complex clinical scenarios requiring trauma centers with obstetrics capabilities. Therefore, the panel felt that this factor should be part of EMS Judgment.

Retained criterion: Burns in conjunction with trauma

Rationale: Consistent with Advanced Trauma Life Support teaching, when a burn patient has other injuries, the injuries should be evaluated and potentially prioritized over the burn. Trauma centers have the capability to quickly evaluate these patients to expedite care for both clinical conditions.

Retained criterion: Children should be triaged preferentially to pediatric capable trauma centers

Rationale: For injured children, research has demonstrated higher survival in pediatric trauma centers compared with adult or mixed trauma centers. However, many regions do not have access to pediatric trauma centers. While transport to a pediatric trauma center is preferable, the panel felt that transport to pediatric versus adult trauma centers should be determined by local protocols and proximity. Based on stakeholder and expert feedback, the panel chose not to use a specific age to define children, as there is insufficient evidence for a specific age limit and systems have established varying age limits based on local resources and practice patterns. Because high ED pediatric readiness has been associated with improved short- and long-term survival of children in US trauma centers, all trauma centers are strongly encouraged to meet such criteria.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^112LRBcK]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Obstetric triage has become one of the most crucial innovations in the field of perinatal care in the past 15 years. In lower- middle- income countries (LMICs), the pregnant patients are seen in a conventional way based on the time of their arrival; this divergent, unbalanced and inequitable approach results in delayed initial evaluation, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and affected clinical outcomes.

This project aimed at implementing an effective and efficient obstetric triage system with improved throughput and care processes within six months to facilitate timely decision making according to the individualized needs of pregnant patients.

A pre-implementation audit was completed for the core evaluation of existing obstetric triage services, followed by a fishbone analysis. Following the Donabedian model for quality care, a quality improvement project was initiated to redesign the obstetric triage system. The project strategy was implemented as part of six PDSA (Plan- Do -Study- Act) cycles to optimize the structure, processes, and obstetric triage outcomes. The triage paradigm moved from time-based care delivery to priority care, and processes were improved based on Angelini's recommendations of best practices in obstetric triage. During the initial phase of improvement, the identified outcome measures were waiting time of 5 minutes from arrival to initial assessment, LOS of 120 minutes, and acuity-based care for at least 50% of patients. A post-implementation audit was conducted to assess improvements. The results showed that the LOS at triage reduced from 240 min (4 hours) to 60 min (1 hour) within 6 months. Furthermore, wait times for triage decreased significantly to 5 min in 65% of patients, compared with 6% in traditional triage practice.

The results indicate that the traditional triage model of the 'order of arrival' process is inefficient in providing adequate obstetric care. This quality initiative facilitated the successful incorporation of the Donabedian model and best practice triage practices and helped achieve desired outcomes of improved LOS and reduced waiting time with acuity-based care. Therefore, the design of an efficient, and the appropriate obstetric triage system can be adopted by other healthcare institutions in a local setting that can facilitate patient centric care.

### An interrater reliability study on the gothenburg obstetric triage system-a new obstetric triage system [^112YtaFK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Triage, aiming at identifying patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions, is an integrated process in managing patients seeking care at emergency departments (EDs) worldwide. It is crucial in order to achieve medically safe prioritization. However, triage has been shown to be the most error-prone activity at the ED. A vast number of triage systems exist, but the absolute majority lack components for triaging obstetric patients. Failure to adequately assess women during pregnancy and the puerperium has repeatedly led to avoidable maternal morbidity and mortality.

Obstetric triage is more complicated and specialised than general triage, requiring assessment of both woman and fetus, as well as of labour status. Moreover, obstetric patients' physiology differs from that in the non-obstetric population, and obstetric patients may present with either pregnancy-related complaints or with symptoms of disorders unrelated to pregnancy. Depending on the location and the hospital, pregnant women seeking emergency care are assessed in EDs, in obstetric triage units or in maternity (delivery) units.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^113Hk1W1]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

For efficient triage, wait times for initial assessment, LOS and priority care are identified as performance measures. Unfortunately, there are currently no defined benchmarks available for these obstetric triage times. According to the obstetric triage system implemented in the United Kingdom(UK), assessment by a midwife should occur within 15 min of patient arrival followed by the assignment of acuity levelwhereas AWHONN recommends that initial assessment should be done in 10 min. Some studies reported a time interval of 5 to 6 min between arrival and initial assessment. Similarly, for LOS variable times have been reported.

For priority care, acuity determination is essential to facilitate standardised care, increase patient satisfaction, and improve system efficiency. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)guidelines for perinatal care also endorse timely assessment of women who present in the labour and delivery area. Currently, four and five tiered obstetric triage acuity tools are available in different countries like obstetrical triage acuity scale (OTAS) in Canada, Maternal Fetal Triage Index (MFTI) and Florida Hospital Obstetric Triage Acuity Tools in United States (USA), Birmingham Symptom Specific Obstetric Triage System (BSOTS) inUK and Swiss Emergency Triage Scale (SETS) in Europe. Some of these acuity tools are validated and allows standardised assessment based on the presenting complaints, key clinical indicators (vital signs and fetal heart rate) and the parameters based on initial evaluation are used to define levels of urgency and subsequent assessment and care plan. Forshaw et al highlighted the lack of specific and validated obstetric triage acuity tools for low-resource areas despite the need to improve quality of care. Only a few studies have reported the use of acuity tools in healthcare facilities of LMICs.

PDSA cycle 2

To develop and enhance our reminder model, an evidence-based obstetric triage acuity tool was indispensable for prioritised patient care. Based on the literature review a paper-based four-tiered acuity tool validated in similar context was adapted. This adapted tool was synchronous to our clinical services and obstetric patients' needs. We preferred four-tiered tool due to simplicity of use, relevance, and practicality. Four levels of acuity were defined based on the urgency of the assessment, the level of the caregiver, the area of assessment, the reassessment and the disposition process (online supplemental file 2 Obstetric Acuity Tool). The acuity assessment was based on the presenting complaint and key clinical indicators including vital signs and fetal heart rate. The tool included obstetrical and non-obstetrical complaints comprising contractions, rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, reduced fetal movements, hypertensive disorder, neurological symptoms, abdominal pain, infection, chest pain and/or breathing problems, urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy. For vital signs cut-off levels adapted to the physiological changes of pregnancy. If two different acuity levels emerged after chief complaint and vital signs, the patient was allocated to the higher level. This initial evaluation was to be completed within 5 min prior to further assessment.

The four tiers were highlighted with colours as red level 1: immediate assessment within 15 min, amber level 2: emergent assessment within 30 min, green level 3: urgent assessment within 60 min and white level 4: non-urgent assessment to be done within 120 min. In available literature review, the timelines for non-urgent cases ranged from 120 min to 240 min for different available acuity tools. We opted for 120 min for acuity level 4 to improve processing time and triage use. This was also in accordance with the hospital recommended benchmark for triage LOS.

The acuity tool was reviewed by senior obstetricians and nurse instructor. Since there was no such model or tool that formally existed in Pakistan, this method proved to be most appropriate in the setting. We decided with implementation of this, we will also establish whether this tool may be applicable in our context. Furthermore, these four acuity levels were supported by a standardised algorithm. Early feedback from nurses indicated that it was frustrating to recall each level of acuity and caused difficulties in the workforce process. This concern was addressed with further PDSA cycles.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^1153iqwC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

The study comprises a modified Delphi method process at a single department of obstetrics in Sweden. The aim was to develop a set of weighted surrogate outcome measures representing acuity at the time of triage for construct validation of OTSs. Potential outcome measures should evaluate the degree of acuity at the time of triage reflected by the ED physician's assessment of the patient and immediate interventions, and with minimum interference or influence by context.

Setting

The Department of Obstetrics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Östra is a tertiary care unit, including an obstetric ED with implemented obstetric emergency triage. The department annually manages approximately 10,000 births and 14,000 emergency visits, from gestational week 18 and up to 12 weeks postpartum. It serves as a county hospital for slightly over 0.5 million inhabitants and is the referral hospital for three county hospitals serving an additional 1.2 million inhabitants. The closest department of obstetrics is 70 km away. The obstetric ED applies the Gothenburg Obstetric Triage System (GOTS), a five-level OTS using symptoms and vital sign parameters for patient assessment. Initial management recommendations include for example electrocardiograms (ECG), cardiotocogram (CTG) and laboratory tests. Midwives perform triage, supported by GOTS, and thereafter assess and manage patient complaints within their profession's competence e.g. rupture of membranes, start of delivery and first assessment of reduced fetal movements. Midwives manage approximately 40% of patients seeking emergency care whereas the rest are assessed and managed by an obstetrician. The department manages low- and high-risk pregnancies. In addition to the midwife and auxiliary nurse staff that are the primary caregivers for uncomplicated deliveries, there are always two senior obstetricians and two trainee obstetricians on site during on-call hours. There is 24/7 operating-theatre accessibility and neonatal care for births from gestational week 22+0. For patient demographics, please see Table 1.

### The design and implementation of an obstetric triage system for unscheduled pregnancy related attendances: a mixed methods evaluation [^113TUKUH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage System described here appears to have excellent inter- operator reliability and appears to be a reliable way of assessing the clinical priority of women. It also appears to improve the organisation of the triage department. A national survey of practice suggests a widespread need for implementation of a standardised obstetric triage system based on clinical assessment and prioritisation of need.

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^111CbBWt]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Ghana has experienced significant increases in institutional deliveries over the past decade without sufficiently addressing the quality of care. Consequently, mortality rates in regional hospitals are significantly higher than the national average. Resources required to treat high-risk patients are often lacking. Regional hospitals often have lower staff-to-patient ratios and higher acuity patients. An increasing work load has been found to be detrimental to morale, attentiveness and outcomes. Obstetric triage practices are unknown and many hospitals appear to operate on a first-come, first-served basis irrespective of patient risk. International guidelines recommend that assessment begin within 10 min of patient arrival to the hospital, to stratify care based on risk and imminence of delivery. Developing strategies to strengthen the initial assessment process is one step towards improving healthcare quality in high-volume obstetric facilities in low-resource countries, yet there are little published data in this context. In this report, we describe the impact of an obstetric triage improvement programme (TIP) implemented at The Greater Accra Regional Hospital (GARH), a major referral hospital in Accra, Ghana.

Comparison of the time of initial assessment, medical assessment and total time in triage in 2012 and 2013

a In 2012 this is the time between arrival and midwifery assessment, in 2013 this is the time between arrival and triage assessment

b Across both years this is the time between arrival and discharge/admission to another location

N.B. This table only contains women for whom the relevant times were recorded

Seventy six per cent of women were discharged home following assessment (data not shown). Of those admitted, the most common reason was suspected labour. The date and venue of next attendance were collected to determine the reliability of the triage assessment, and can be found in Additional file 2: Table S4. The majority of women were seen over a week later (60%), mainly for scheduled antenatal visits, 32% of women gave birth and date of next contact is unknown for 7%.

Review of the 27 cases with serious maternal or neonatal events (defined above) within 24 h of Triage assessment provided evidence of the reliability and validity of the standardised triage assessment, with these events occurring a number of hours after the triage assessment and being related to labour/ birth.

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^112wKX1k]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient demographic data (table 1) and reasons for referral (table 2) are similar across phases. The median (IQR) waiting time from hospital arrival to first evaluation by a midwife decreased from 40 min (15–100)to 5 min (2–6) (p < 0.001) over the course of the analysis. With Phase 1 as the reference, Phase 2 achieved an 11 min reduction (p < 0.001) and Phase 3, a 33 min reduction (p = 0.002) in waiting time (table 1). Improvements were sustained during Phase 4 and Phase 5 with 35 min reductions (p < 0.001) in waiting time compared with baseline (table 1). In Phase 1, 45% (414/926) of women were evaluated in less than 30 min; the hospital's target time for patient assessment. This increased to 51% (82/162) in Phase 2, 85% (656/770) in Phase 3, 97% (843/869) in Phase 4 and 99% (535/542) in Phase 5 (p < 0.001) (figure 2). In addition, the documentation of a treatment plan by the midwives as part of their triage assessment increased from 51% (552/1082) in Phase 1 to 96% (751/784) in Phase 3 (p < 0.001).

### Alliance for innovation on maternal health: consensus bundle on sepsis in obstetric care [^112xv97i]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Operationalizing alerts, patient evaluations, protocols, and prompt treatment requires staff education, accessible step-by-step instructions, and practical simulation. It is helpful to identify champions for each type of care team member (physicians, advanced practice professionals, nurses, rapid response team, pharmacy) to serve as a leader for dissemination of new processes.

2. Provide Multidisciplinary Education on Obstetric Sepsis to All Clinicians and Staff that Provide Care to Pregnant and Postpartum People, Including in Non–Labor And Delivery Settings Such as EDs, ICUs, & Outpatient Clinics

Pregnant patients are often cared for in settings that mostly serve nonpregnant patients. Between 5% and 10% of postpartum patients present to the hospital within 42 days of delivery, often to EDs rather than labor and delivery units. Admission due to infection occurs in 15.5% of all postpartum readmissions. Additionally, the most recent national estimate in 2020 reports that 1.7 per 1,000 deliveries are complicated by ICU admission and sepsis is the primary indication for admission in 5% of ICU admissions. Education about sepsis in obstetric care and the importance of obstetric specific-screening, diagnosis, and treatment in all settings where pregnant and postpartum patients are provided care is key for early identification and improved outcomes.

In a national database study of delivery hospitalizations and postpartum readmissions, approximately half of sepsis cases occurred in the postdischarge postpartum period. Therefore, when a patient calls with symptoms related to infection, the health care team should use a preadmission risk assessment to determine the next steps for evaluation. A preadmission risk assessment includes setting criteria for urgent or emergent care, such as sending the patient to the ED or labor and delivery triage for assessment. An example of a prerisk hospital assessment would be to ask whether the patient is experiencing any of the AIM "Urgent Maternal Warning Signs". When patients are at home, they will report symptoms rather than vital signs and identification of warning signs can shorten time to urgent clinical evaluation.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^113asmkW]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Based on these observations, in a health organisation a quality based triage system can be devised by integration of Angelini's key strategies within Donabedian framework using PDSA cycles to achieve 'Best Triage Model'. Ultimate improvement in triage system can lead to efficient and safe patient care with a reduction in LOS, improved patient satisfaction and reduced morbidity. A standardised triage system is not used in healthcare facilities in Pakistan. This project will also provide a pathway for other care providers in LMICs to consider adapting these strategies in their institutions.

Rationale

After recognising a substantial problem with obstetric triage, a project team was established to assess the issues, identify causes, and focus on the problem as a priority. A baseline audit of L&D triage was conducted to evaluate triage throughput, including waiting time (arrival to initial assessment) and LOS during the first quarter of the year in 2018. The data were collected over a month, using a structured survey to get an 'idea' of the problem. The audit results showed triage waiting time ranged widely between five to 240 min and a 5 min target wait time was achieved in only 6% patients (figure 1). Whereas LOS in L&D triage extended up to 3 to 4 hours, irrespective of the patient's clinical presentations and in 16% of cases LOS was not documented (figure 2).

Figure 1
Triage waiting time from arrival to initial assessment.

Figure 2
Length of stay.

Based on the results of the audit, the team determined that delays in the initial assessment and further assessment resulted in an increase in LOS and wait times. The project team decided on cause-and-effect analysis using fishbone diagram(online supplemental file 1 Fishbone Diagram). The in-depth analysis of the problem identified issues in different steps of the routine triage flow process. Patients presenting at triage initially reporting to the unit receptionist, had to complete the check-in process before a registered nurse was notified of the patient's arrival. The assigned nurse, engaged in other patients' assessments in the triage room, was sometimes unaware of patient's arrival for a significant period. Similarly, issues were identified for timely involvement of the physicians. Initial nursing evaluation and obstetric assessment by physicians were performed in a single, three bedded triage room. Factors like occupancy of triage beds for unpredictable times, delay in patient assessment irrespective of clinical presentation and compromised communication among healthcare providers were contributing to prolonged waiting times and delay in the initial assessment.

RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION (EVERY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND CLINICAL SETTING)

8. and 9. Obtain a Focused Pregnancy and Cardiac History in All Care Settings, Including Emergency Department, Urgent Care, and Primary Care, for Reproductive-Aged Patients Regardless of Cardiac Symptoms

Individuals with symptoms of pregnancy-related complications or concerns may enter the health care system at different access points depending on the severity of symptoms and individual access to care. A recent pregnancy may not be apparent to a health care professional or recognized by a patient themselves as relevant to their current symptoms. Obtaining a focused pregnancy and cardiac history for reproductive-aged patients presenting for care is vital to understanding an individual's cardiac risk in all care settings. Questions to ask patients may include, "Are you currently pregnant, or have you been pregnant within the last year?" and "Do you have a personal history of cardiac disease?" Referral to a cardiologist may be indicated depending on the significance of obstetric and cardiac factors identified during the assessment.

In the primary care setting, a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes may guide patient counseling about risk of future cardiac disease and recommendations for immediate or follow-up care.

10. Assess Whether Escalating Warning Signs for an Imminent Cardiac Event are Present

Pregnant and postpartum people presenting to any care setting with acute cardiac symptoms or abnormal examination findings should be evaluated promptly for cardiac disease as detailed in Boxes 2 and 3.

11. Use Standardized Cardiac Risk-Assessment Tools to Identify and Stratify Risk

Staff training and integration of cardiac risk-assessment tools and documentation into the electronic medical record may support regular utilization of the standardized assessment tools. More detail on standardized cardiac risk assessments can be found in Readiness Element 1.

12. Conduct a Risk-Appropriate Workup for Cardiac Conditions to Establish a Diagnosis and Implement the Initial Management Plan

The initial evaluation for anyone presenting with red flag symptoms, concerning physical examination findings, or multiple abnormal symptoms, vital signs, or risk factors indicating nonemergent or prompt evaluation, as indicated in Figure 1, require appropriate testing and care. The underlying cardiac condition and symptomatology at presentation guide the type and timing of testing. Further testing to evaluate for alternate diagnoses or comorbid medical conditions may be indicated pending primary test results and ongoing or escalating symptoms. Referral to a Pregnancy Heart Team or cardiologist may be indicated.

### The design and implementation of an obstetric triage system for unscheduled pregnancy related attendances: a mixed methods evaluation [^1172PSpw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The Birmingham symptom specific obstetric triage system: Development and implementation

The system was co-produced by researchers and clinicians led by an obstetrician and a researcher, and involved a group of senior midwives working on Delivery Suite and in Triage who formed a Development Group (DG). Co production in this context being a process involving clinicians and researchers working alongside each other at almost all stages of the project. An Advisory group was also convened to oversee the development and implementation of the system.

The key clinical indicators and their parameters (guided by those used by the MTS) for the initial assessment (triage) defined the level of clinical urgency using a 4-category scale. The guidelines for immediate care and investigation were developed by the DG using the available evidence, and consensus statements with the agreement of the local obstetric consultants.

The BSOTS included:
Completion of a standard clinical triage assessment by a midwife within 15 min of a woman's attendance. This includes taking a brief maternal history, completion of baseline maternal observations (temperature, pulse, respirations and blood pressure), assessment of pain levels (using a numerical pain score), abdominal palpation and auscultation of the fetal heart rate (if the woman was antenatal).
This assessment is used to define a category of clinical urgency, which guides timing of subsequent assessment and immediate care (by an obstetrician if required).
Categories of clinical urgency (see Fig. 1 for example) were defined as: ◦ Red: immediate further assessment ◦ Orange: further assessment within 15 min ◦ Yellow: further assessment within an hour ◦ Green: further assessment within 4 h
Standardised symptom-specific algorithms were developed for allocation of clinical priority and the immediate care and further investigation of the eight commonest reasons for attendance (abdominal pain, antenatal bleeding, hypertension, suspected labour, ruptured membranes, reduced fetal movements, unwell/other, and postnatal concerns). Documentation is provided to support and standardise completion of the clinical tasks required (see example in Fig. 1).
The introduction of the BSOTS was supported by a comprehensive staff training programme.

### An interrater reliability study on the gothenburg obstetric triage system-a new obstetric triage system [^11345UN2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

A small number of obstetric triage systems (OTS) have been introduced internationally since the early 2010s. These OTSs have adequate interrater reliability (IRR), assessed in obstetric settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, their implementation in a general ED setting has not been evaluated. To ensure that the system is adequate for assessing obstetric patients, the IRR must be established for both staff that are trained and untrained in obstetrics. Until 2017, there was no OTS for assessment of obstetric patients seeking emergency care in Sweden. Patients have traditionally been assessed according to "who came first" or with triage systems that were not adapted to the physiological changes and spectrum of disease associated with pregnancy.

The Gothenburg Obstetric Triage System (GOTS), developed in 2016 and in clinical use since 2017, has similarities with other OTS such as the Obstetrical Triage Acuity Scale (OTAS). The GOTS, described by Lindroos et al. in 2021 (submitted for publication), is a five-level triage scale with cut-off levels for vital signs adapted to the physiological changes of pregnancy. The GOTS includes 14 chief complaint algorithms comprising contractions, suspected rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, reduced fetal movements, suspected hypertensive disorder, neurological symptoms, abdominal/back pain, trauma, postpartum haemorrhage, signs of intra- or postpartum infection, chest pain and/or breathing problems, suspected thromboembolic disease, hyperemesis and suspected mastitis. The triage assessment is a construct based on the chief complaint and vital sign parameters. If two different acuity levels emerge from the chief complaint and the vital signs, the patient is allocated to the higher level. Initial validity research on the GOTS has shown a substantial ability to identify and adequately triage patients requiring admittance to hospital. The GOTS differs from other OTS in that it has embedded recommendations for initial management, such as laboratory analyses, as well as brief information on both obstetric and non-obstetric possible causes of symptoms. Moreover, it has an attached documentation form.

The aim of this study was to determine the IRR of the GOTS in obstetric and non-obstetric emergency care staff. A comparison with a reference group was also performed to assess the clinical accuracy and relevance of the IRR.

### Factors influencing time to disposition in obstetric triage: a clinical, operational, and patient-specific analysis [^114hEWQ7]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to assess factors impacting obstetric triage time to disposition. The primary and secondary hypotheses were that high-risk patients and patients evaluated during periods with less staffing would experience prolonged length of stay (LOS), respectively. This single-site, retrospective cohort study analyzed 9,704 obstetric triage visits of 6,182 patients between January 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023. Inclusion criteria included patients 18 years or older with one or more evaluations. Exclusion criteria included scheduled admissions, unknown chief complaints, triage time under 10minutes, and patients under 18 years old. A total of 6,612 visits representing 4,390 patients were included. The visits were stratified by disposition: admission versus nonadmission (transfer or discharge). Descriptive statistics analyze continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. SAS was used for chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the two-sample t -test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous data. Statistical significance was p -value < 0.05. Of 6,612 visits, 3,475 admissions, and 3,137 nonadmissions occurred. The most common chief complaints were contractions (42%), amniotic fluid index evaluation (18%), and preeclampsia evaluation (8%). Admitted compared with nonadmitted patients had shorter LOS (64minutes vs. 185minutes, p < 0.001). Admitted compared with nonadmitted patients had shorter LOS by chief complaint, gestational age, high-risk maternal-fetal medicine status, time of day, and day of the week (all p < 0.001). Nonadmitted, maternal-fetal medicine and preterm patients evaluated during daytime and weekdays had significantly longer LOS. Vulnerable populations and target times for triage workflow improvement were identified. · Patient and unit factors influenced LOS. · Nonadmitted patients had triple the LOS. · High-risk patients had longer LOS. · Daytime and weekday visits had longer LOS.

### Exploring the third delay: an audit evaluating obstetric triage at mulago national referral hospital [^111fy8iM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The concept of triage describes sorting patients in order of the urgency of their condition, prioritising those who require prompt treatment. It is done by rapidly assessing all patients to determine their immediate medical need. Triage is an important tool in ensuring that patients have access to care within an appropriate time frame, and thus is a key factor in reducing mortality. Western studies have recognised the importance of obstetric triage in reducing maternal mortality, but the evidence base for Uganda and other low and middle income countries is limited. Due to the high volume of patients at Mulago hospital, triage could be a particularly valuable tool for the maternity department.

The Eleanor Bradley Fellowship is a scheme by which successive British obstetricians are selected to work in Mulago Hospital for a year at a time. During the second year of this programme, a 'Traffic Light System' was developed and introduced to the labour ward by the fellow in collaboration with the Mulago specialists (Appendix 1). This system is based on that of UK units and uses the patients' presenting complaint, observations, results of basic tests such as urine dipstick, past medical and obstetric history, and diagnosis to assign a category to them. Depending on the classification there is a recommended time frame and provider assigned to the patient. The Manchester Triage System is used to recommend the time frame, and the 'Traffic Light System' is used to identify who should review the patients.

The Mulago admissions system works as follows: patients enter the department at 'I' and approach the admissions desk marked ' II '. At the desk, a file is created for the patient and the patient is asked to wait on the benches 'III' outside the admissions room ' IV '. Women are then called into the admissions room one by one and examined.

Triage is possible at two steps along this journey: one being at the admissions desk (II), which would affect the order in which patients are called into the admissions room, and the second being in the admissions room itself (IV).

Two years have passed since this 'Traffic Light System' was first introduced. The following audit was designed to look at how the system is being used and to identify any problems with either the system itself or its implementation. The aim of this process is to ensure that the system provides maximum benefit, particularly as there is no recent data about whether or not the system is being consistently applied.

### The design and implementation of an obstetric triage system for unscheduled pregnancy related attendances: a mixed methods evaluation [^1174BGNz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

No standardised system of triage exists in Maternity Care and local audit identified this to be problematic. We designed, implemented and evaluated an Obstetric Triage System in a large UK maternity unit. This includes a standard clinical triage assessment by a midwife, within 15 min of attendance, leading to assignment to a category of clinical urgency (on a 4-category scale). This guides timing of subsequent standardised immediate care for the eight most common reasons for attendance. A training programme was integral to the introduction.

Methods

A mixed methods evaluation was conducted. A structured audit of 994 sets of maternity notes before and after implementation identified the number of women seen within 15 min of attendance. Secondary measures reviewed included time to subsequent care and attendance. An inter-operator reliability study using scenarios was completed by midwives. A focus group and two questionnaire studies were undertaken to explore midwives' views of the system and to evaluate the training. In addition a national postal survey of practice in UK maternity units was undertaken in 2015.

Results

The structured audit of 974/992 (98%) of notes demonstrated an increase in the number of women seen within 15 min of attendance from 39% before implementation to 54% afterwards (RR (95% CI) 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) p = < 0.0001).

Excellent inter-operator reliability (ICC 0.961 (95% CI 0.91–0.99)) was demonstrated with breakdown showing consistently good rates.

Thematic analysis of focus group data (n = 12) informed the development of the questionnaire which was sent to all appropriate midwives. The response rate was 53/79 (67%) and the midwives reported that the new system helped them manage the department and improved safety.

The National Survey (response rate 85/135 [63%]) demonstrated wide variation in where women are seen and staffing models in place. The majority of units 69/85 (81%) did not use a triage system based on clinical assessment to prioritise care.

Conclusions

This obstetric triage system has excellent inter- operator reliability and appears to be a reliable way of assessing the clinical priority of women as well as improving organisation of the department. Our survey has demonstrated the widespread need for implementation of such a system.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^113LDnSe]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Problem

This quality initiative is conducted in the labour and delivery (L&D) triage area of a tertiary care hospital that accounts to more than 6000 deliveries per annum. With a monthly turnover of 400–500 pregnant women, triage area is staffed round the clock to meet the needs of patients visiting L&D with complaints related to pregnancy concerns, labour and birth, medical problems and maternal-fetal surveillance. Booked patients with 24 completed weeks gestation and above are assessed in L&D triage whereas unbooked pregnant women and booked patients with less than 24 weeks gestation are assessed by the emergency department.

In our healthcare setup, obstetric triage was implemented in a traditional pattern whereby the pregnant patients were seen and evaluated on the basis of their reporting time at the reception instead of the urgency of their clinical presentation. In 2018, a sentinel event happened to a pregnant woman waiting in L&D triage. The patient presented with labour pains and per vaginal leaking, her assessment was delayed due to other patients waiting before her, triage turnover was slow due to non-availability of bed and busy staffing. When finally assessed, she was in active labour with grade 2 meconium-stained liquor, and cardiotocography was pathological. Her emergency caesarean was performed, however, due to delayed intervention, there was a serious jeopardy with adverse neonatal outcome results.

This sentinel occurrence triggered an urgent need to examine existing obstetric triage practices and develop a more efficient and safe triage process. In addition, there has been an increase in reported cases and patient complaints with respect to timeliness of care and wait times. In order to mitigate the risk and further incidents, quality initiative team consisted of obstetric experts and lead nurses decided to conduct a quality project to bring improvement by revamping of the obstetric triage system. The primary objective was to enhance triage performance by reducing wait time and length of stay (LOS) and providing priority care. As there were no prior data available for triage system evaluation, an audit was planned to provide a baseline assessment of the triage flow process including LOS and wait time for initial assessment. The goal was to compare data prior to and after the intervention.

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^114b4xT6]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Initial implementation

Once an innovation is implemented, process data are used to monitor implementation barriers and evaluate adaptation for local fit. The didactic portion of the obstetric triage course was taught at GARH over eight sessions with approximately eight participants each between January 2013 and September 2014. Two clinical champions were selected to be the facilitators of triage implementation. The clinical champions were frontline midwives chosen during the initial training due to their enthusiasm and quick grasp of the triage concepts. They were provided additional training in leadership and QI, after which they led the monitoring and evaluation activities. The last course was delivered by the GARH triage clinical champions, with support from the Kybele trainers.

The triage course resulted in three jointly developed QI interventions. First, the 'triage' room at the labour ward entrance was outfitted with monitors, supplies for primary assessment and initial treatment. Second, red, yellow and green patient wristbands were introduced to identify women as high, intermediate or low risk based on the triage assessment. The bands were worn for the duration of the hospital stay and alerted staff of a woman's acuity. Third, a triage assessment form was created as a time-saving tool that guided midwives towards making a diagnosis and treatment plan. Although just a simple form, the process of identifying risk and creating a plan, empowered midwives to take responsibility for making an initial diagnosis and management plan since doctors were often unavailable. Actions such as writing the assessor's name on the form, increased accountability in accordance with the course content. It was hypothesised that having a better equipped room to assess patients, a way of quickly distinguishing high-risk patients and a rubric for developing an initial treatment plan would optimise the triage process and reduce the wait time for evaluation and treatment.

Using data to assess implementation and drive decision-making is a hallmark of initial implementation. This involves the use of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to iteratively improve implementation. Clinical champions were trained in a QI approach based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's 'Model for Improvement'. Ward managers tracked wristband usage at the beginning of each shift and the clinical champions conducted weekly random chart reviews to determine whether the bands were correctly applied. Additionally, they were sponsored on a 2-week visit to England to observe obstetric triage practices in action.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^114K6v6Y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Round 2

A new invitation for a physical meeting was sent to the obstetricians participating in round 1. The question to be addressed was: " If your assessment of the ED patient reveals a severe and/or urgent case of any of the 63 conditions, which intervention/treatment would you initiate at the ED that you would not initiate if the case were less severe/urgent?" Midwives were excluded from further participation as initiating interventions/treatments for patients presenting with severe and/or urgent symptoms is not within their profession's task or competence.

All but one obstetrician attended the meeting. The discussion was held in a comfortable environment and was moderated by the first author (LL), to ensure that all participants took part in the discussion. The discussion proceeded until the predetermined level of 100% consensus was achieved, meaning that all participants were in total agreement regarding relevant intervention/treatment. Forty interventions were identified.

Two of the authors (LL and VS) reviewed all interventions in order to remove interventions already included in the GOTS, such as basic laboratory testing or cardiotocogram (CTG) in specific conditions.

Round 3

The 30 remaining interventions and the rationales for removing the others (Supplement 1) were sent by email to the six obstetricians participating in round 2 for assessment and confirmation. Again, 100% consensus was achieved.

Round 4

While all obstetricians agreed that the 30 interventions were potentially life-saving, it was evident that some interventions were directly life-saving while other interventions were needed to differentiate life-threatening conditions from less severe conditions. Thus, interventions corresponding to directly life-saving procedures needed to be classified differently from interventions that ruled out more severe conditions. Therefore, a fourth and final round was initiated. With the 30 interventions serving as outcome measures for urgency in triage, the final round aimed to further specify the interventions' significance and correlate them to different levels of acuity. A new invitation was sent to the six participating obstetricians from round 3, and four were able to participate. The interventions were anonymously graded at one of three levels: 1) not directly lifesaving/preventing lasting morbidity, 2) potentially lifesaving/preventing lasting morbidity and 3) directly lifesaving/preventing lasting morbidity. This was followed by discussion until 100% consensus was reached. This grading led to the division of one previous intervention into two due to two different acuity levels, finally resulting in 31 interventions.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^112du8et]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

All triage systems should be validated to guarantee patient safety and correctly allocate resources. A structured consensus-building technique such as a modified Delphi process can be used to develop suitable outcome measures with high face validity. The outcome measures created in this study may serve as a template for validating OTSs in similar contexts. Future studies should focus on validating available OTS and testing the developed outcome measures in different clinical setting.

### Evaluation, stabilization, and transfer of pregnant and postpartum patients presenting to emergency departments without inpatient obstetric services [^111xVzv7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

More than 50% of rural critical access hospitals in the United States no longer provide inpatient obstetric services. As more hospitals close their hospital-based obstetric services, emergency physicians must still be ready to care for pregnant patients who present emergently for care. Ideally, this will include immediate medical screening examination, stabilization and transfer to a hospital with obstetric services. In other circumstances, it will result in the need to provide basic obstetric emergency care for conditions such as unanticipated delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, eclamptic seizure, and neonatal resuscitation. Emergency physicians working in hospitals without inpatient obstetric services need to have knowledge of both the closest obstetric unit they can transfer a full-term patient for obstetric triage and delivery, and where they can transfer a preterm patient at any gestational age. Level I Obstetrical Units (low-risk units) can typically accept patients with more than 37 weeks gestation. Regional maternal centers (Level III/Level IV) can typically accept any gestational age. It is critical for emergency physicians working in facilities without inpatient obstetrics to be familiar with both resources in their catchment area (eg, nearby low-risk and regional high-risk centers). This article examines the emergency physician's role in evaluation, stabilization, and transfer of pregnant and postpartum patients seeking emergency medical care at facilities without inpatient obstetric services.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^1115TRGC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Validating triage systems

Validity is defined as a system's ability to truly measure what it is supposed to measure.

Criterion validity reflects the true validity and is assessed by a system's correlation to a "gold standard", for example by comparing a new system to a pre-existing validated system. There is, at date, no established golden standard for measuring acuity in obstetric emergency patients.

Construct validity uses surrogate outcome measures, identified by expert consensus or chosen by convenience, in the absence of a "gold standard". Face validity is an informal and subjective form of validity, based on the expertise of the experts developing a new system.

A generally accepted definition of validity within the triage field is "the degree to which the measured acuity level reflects the patient's true acuity at the time of triage". As there is no definition of true acuity, construct validity with different surrogate outcome measures is assessed. Mortality in the ED, admission to hospital or intensive care unit (ICU), length of stay (LOS) in the ED, resource utilisation and costs might serve as surrogate outcomes.

The appropriateness of such outcome measures and the extent to which they reflect acuity at the time of triage have repeatedly been debated. The outcome measures are highly affected by local factors such as ED organisation, available resources and the situation in related in-house departments. The rationale for applying the outcome measures and a description of their context is rarely presented, and reference standards or measures have yet to be established. Furthermore, the purpose of the triage process is to establish acuity at the time of triage, not to predict clinical outcome.

Without defined outcome measures, validating triage systems and their ability to accurately triage patients seeking emergency care may jeopardize patient safety, putting patients at risk of being falsely assessed and hence, receiving inadequate and/or untimely care. Indeed, two reviews concerning OTS validity have revealed extensive research gaps. Apart from the Maternal Fetal Triage Index, for which content validity was tested during development, the authors conclude that no adequate testing for any form of validity has been undertaken for existing OTSs. Later, several types of validity testing for the Iranian OB Triage Index were presented. However, the methodology may be questioned, as the above-mentioned, previously debated outcome measures were used for evaluation; furthermore, criterion validity was assessed by comparison with a triage system previously deemed inappropriate for the context.

Obstetrical and gynecological conditions — patient care goals and presentation criteria emphasize early recognition of pregnancy-related hemorrhage and resuscitation needs, define who is included for assessment, and specify exclusions. Goals are to "Recognize serious conditions associated with hemorrhage during pregnancy even when hemorrhage or pregnancy is not apparent (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, abruptio placenta, placenta previa)" and to "Provide adequate resuscitation for hypovolemia". Inclusion criteria are "Female patient with vaginal bleeding in any trimester", "Female patient with pelvic pain or possible ectopic pregnancy", and "Consider pregnancy in any female between the ages of 10–60 years of age". Exclusions are "Childbirth and active labor" and "Postpartum hemorrhage".

### A framework proposal for quality and safety measurement in gynecologic emergency care [^115aUyck]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

From a patient safety viewpoint, the conditions we define as potentially life-threatening share a medically plausible link between undesirable outcome and the inpatient process of care, in that a likely outcome of diagnostic error or therapeutic delay is progression toward severe morbidities that may cause temporary or permanent disability or even death. From the perspective of organization of care, appendicitis has nothing to do with gynecologic emergency departments, but our study shows that diagnostic errors lead not uncommonly to the initial management of these cases in gynecology, which represents the loss of an opportunity to resolve or treat them as early as possible, before they become critical. This is equally applicable to settings where most patients use a general emergency department for triage; there are often delays in gynecologic emergency diagnoses and unnecessary diagnostic tests that add to delays and costs.

One strength of this study is the specificity of emergency gynecologic care in France and Belgium in which all women with acute gynecologic symptoms, pregnant or not, are seen at gynecologic emergency departments. This model of care is similar to those of "acute gynecology units" tested in the United Kingdom and Australia. Accordingly, on-call obstetrics and gynecology residents or board-certified specialists perform initial patient evaluations, including vaginal examinations and routine bedside transvaginal ultrasonography. This provides an ideal setting for defining potentially life-threatening emergencies and near misses in the field of gynecology and assessing their relative frequencies.

### Remote care and triage of obstetric patients with COVID-19 in the community: operational considerations [^113sdfoJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria and initial assessment

The MVW identified pregnant patients with confirmed-positive COVID-19 via three routes: discharge from hospital, direct contact from a patient in the community, and positive swabs in the community (Pillar 2 of the National Testing Strategy). Details of those with positive swabs were supplied via a dataset from NHS England, and cross referenced with the maternity database (E3, Wellbeing Software, Mansfield, U.K.). Initially, all women were called by a member of the obstetric medical team to perform a risk assessment for complications from COVID-19 in pregnancy. As the pandemic progressed and numbers grew, midwives were trained to do these initial risk assessments, and the obstetric team only contacted the patients if there were concerns from the midwifery team. All patients continued in the MVW initially, but subsequently only patients meeting any of triage criteria were admitted, to cope with increasing case numbers and target those who would derive most benefit. The triage criteria included ethnicity, age, BMI, comorbidities, vaccination status and socioeconomic deprivation and social support (Table 2). They were taken from the RCOG Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection in Pregnancy guideline, with the additional risk factor of limited spoken English, to reflect the additional needs of marginalised populations. Patients who did not require hospitalisation, or who did not meet any of the MVW criteria were given isolation advice and signposted to further help should they require it.

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^117ApH9Y]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Institutional delivery has been proposed as a method for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, but little is known about how referral hospitals in low-resource settings can best manage the expected influx of patients. In this study, we assess the impact of an obstetric triage improvement programme on reducing hospital-based delay in a referral hospital in Accra, Ghana. An Active Implementation Framework is used to describe a 5-year intervention to introduce and monitor obstetric triage capabilities. Baseline data, collected from September to November 2012, revealed significant delays in patient assessment on arrival. A triage training course and monitoring of quality improvement tools occurred in 2013 and 2014. Implementation barriers led to the construction of a free-standing obstetric triage pavilion, opened January 2015, with dedicated midwives. Data were collected at three time intervals following the triage pavilion opening and compared with baseline including: referral indications, patient and labour characteristics, waiting time from arrival to assessment and the documentation of a care plan. An obstetric triage improvement programme reduced the median (IQR) patient waiting time from facility arrival to first assessment by a midwife from 40min (15–100) to 5min (2–6) (p < 0.001) over the 5-year intervention. The triage pavilion enhanced performance resulting in the elimination of previous delays associated with the time of admission and disease acuity. Care plan documentation increased from 51% to 96%. Obstetric triage, when properly implemented, reduced delay in a busy, low-resource hospital. The implementation process was sustained under local leadership during transition to a new hospital.

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^112hAHre]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Reflection

By analysing this intervention, we found that a systematically implemented programme to introduce obstetric triage to a high-volume referral hospital in a low-income country can achieve international standards for performance and thereby reduce the third delay. International guidelines recommend that women and fetuses be evaluated within 10 min of hospital arrival. Initially, this standard seemed unachievable, so the hospital set a modified goal of 30 min, however, a higher standard was achieved. By the end of the project 99% of women were evaluated within 30 min compared with only 45% initially, and the median wait time from arrival to evaluation and initial treatment was reduced from 40 to 5 min.

Training is commonly offered by NGOs and multinational organisations, but it represents only a small part of implementation. Research by Wandersman and others has shown that in addition to training, an implementation support system that consists of tools, ongoing coaching and QI is needed. This programme utilised a systematic methodology which included mentoring, monitoring and evaluation conducted through a data-driven continuous QI approach. Data were collected prospectively and change monitored throughout the process. Implementation included jointly developed tools such as the triage assessment form, colour-coded wristbands and triage guidelines. The hospital leadership was committed to process improvement over a multiyear programme. Local leadership buy-in is critical to the success of implementation. Furthermore, the entire programme was conducted at GARH, without per diem expenditures, which maximised staff involvement and minimised cost.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^113aT1gL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible participants (seven obstetricians and seven midwives) were purposefully invited, based on their extensive experience in both obstetrics and obstetric emergency triage. The midwives and obstetricians had 5–11 and 10–30 years of experience, respectively. All obstetricians had expertise in maternal-fetal medicine and participate in both undergraduate and resident education. All participants worked clinically at the same department, as it was the only Swedish department undertaking obstetric triage at the time of the study. The participants received no financial compensation.

The Delphi process

A four-round modified Delphi process was conducted during 2021–2023. Table 2 presents a summary of the process. Supplementary table 1 constitutes a more detailed presentation. All participants were informed about the study purpose and the voluntary nature of participation. Absence from one round excluded further participation. Answering the questionnaire anonymously (round 1) was considered equivalent to consenting to participate. For the following Delphi rounds, written informed consent was given. Due to the aim of the discussions and the different professions' responsibilities in the ED, the midwives did not participate beyond round 1.

Round 1

A written invitation to participate was sent by e-mail to eligible participants. All obstetricians (7/7) and three midwives (3/7) chose to participate. After initial consent was provided, an online questionnaire was distributed. The questionnaire was based on patient charts from 380 consecutive visits to the ED, identifying the most common signs and symptoms of the patients attending the obstetric ED. It contained descriptions of the most urgent presentations of these symptoms, such as "gestational week < 34 and ongoing vaginal bleeding and/or contractions" or "decreased fetal movements and no detectable heart rate". For a full description of signs and symptoms, see Supplement 2. Each description was assessed with the question, "Which conditions or diagnoses are you concerned about in a patient with these symptoms?". Participants answered with unlimited free text. Sixty-three conditions or diagnoses were identified in round 1; they were subsequently summarised in a document for round 2 (see Supplement 3).

### Inpatient obstetric management of COVID-19 [^114pBmfh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe inpatient management strategies and considerations for pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

Findings

The novel coronavirus has posed challenges to both obstetric patients and the staff caring for them, due to its variable presentation and current limited knowledge about the disease. Inpatient antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum management can be informed by risk stratification, severity of disease, and gestational age. Careful planning and anticipation of emergent situations can prevent unnecessary exposures to patients and clinical staff.

Conclusion

As new data arises, management recommendations will evolve, thus practitioners must maintain a low threshold for adaptation of their clinical practice during obstetric care for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^11547hZz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstetric emergency triage is more complex than general emergency triage, since the pregnant woman, the fetus and labour status all must be assessed. It is a relatively new branch of triage and is not an integrated part of obstetric emergency care in Sweden. As in general emergency triage, there is no definition of true acuity for obstetric emergency patients. This makes validation of triage systems difficult and results in unclear capacity to identify patients requiring urgent attention. Predominately applied surrogate outcome measures do not reflect acuity at the time of triage and are often affected by organisational factors. The study aims to develop a set of weighted surrogate outcome measures representing acuity at the time of triage, enabling construct validation of obstetric triage systems.

Methods

A four-round modified Delphi process was performed at a single tertiary obstetrics department. Seven obstetricians and three midwives participated in round 1, while only obstetricians participated in rounds 2–4 based on the profession's competence. The consensus level for rounds 2–4 was predefined at 100%.

Results

A set of 31 immediate obstetrician-initiated interventions at the emergency department, for a patient presenting with an urgent condition, were defined. The interventions reflect acuity level at the time of triage and with minimum interference or influence by context. The outcomes were weighted at three levels, stratifying urgency in the most severe presentations of these conditions.

Conclusion

As true acuity in a patient seeking emergency care has not been defined, outcome measures reflecting true acuity at the time of triage should be applied when validating triage systems. Previous studies on validity in obstetric triage systems are scarce and inconclusive regarding internal and external validity. The outcome measures developed in this study may serve as a template for validating obstetric triage systems implemented in similar contexts.

### Validation of a clinical risk scoring system, based solely on clinical presentation, for the management of pregnancy of unknown location [^114UWEfw]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess a scoring system to triage women with a pregnancy of unknown location.

Design

Validation of prediction rule.

Setting

Multicenter study.

Patient(S)

Women with a pregnancy of unknown location.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Scores assigned to factors identified at clinical presentation, total score calculated to assess risk of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women with a pregnancy of unknown location, and a proposed three-tiered clinical action plan.

Result(S)

The cohort of 1,400 women (284 ectopic pregnancies, 759 miscarriages, and 357 intrauterine pregnancies) was more diverse than the original cohort used to develop the decision rule. The recommendations of the action plan were low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk; the recommendation based on the model score was compared with clinical diagnosis. A total of 29.4% intrauterine pregnancies were identified for less frequent follow-up observation, and 18.4% nonviable gestations were identified for more frequent follow-up observation (to rule out an ectopic pregnancy) compared with intermediate risk (i.e., monitor in current standard fashion). For a decision of possible less frequent monitoring, the specificity was 90.8% (89.0–92.6) with negative predictive value of 79.0% (76.7–81.3). For a decision of more intense follow-up observation, the specificity was 95.0% (92.7–97.2). Test characteristics using the scoring system were replicated in the diverse validation cohort.

Conclusion(S)

A scoring system based on symptoms at presentation has value to stratify risk and influence the intensity of outpatient surveillance for women with pregnancy of unknown location but does not serve as a diagnostic tool.

### Validating obstetric triage systems, what are we really measuring – A modified Delphi process introducing outcome measures for obstetric emergency triage systems [^117SmkbA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This paper describes the transparent process that generated outcome measures specific enough to serve as a foundation for comparative studies on obstetric triage in similar contexts.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish surrogate outcome measures for obstetric triage and thereby enabling construct validation and comparisons of OTS. The modified Delphi process was based on actual patients seeking emergency care at the unit and all the participants have extensive clinical experience and knowledge on obstetric patients seeking acute care, granting high face validity. Consensus building techniques, such as a Delphi process, are applicable when traditionally used, research-based techniques are inapplicable and high face validity is a prerequisite for potential further development of the outcome measures.

The process was context-related, which may have reduced generalisability. Nevertheless, in contexts like the Swedish healthcare system and with similar population and disease-spectrum, the outcome measures should be applicable.

The number of participants in the Delphi process was somewhat small, partly because no other unit in Sweden had implemented obstetric triage as a working method at the time of this study. Inviting additional obstetricians from the same unit was considered superfluous as the included participants represent a diversity in experience and clinical profile. All participants being from the same unit may constitute a bias; the discussion being potentially influenced by a patient management culture and hierarchy. Including clinicians from other clinics might have led to a more diverse discussion. Nevertheless, the Delphi process continued until 100% consensus was reached in rounds 2–4.

### Effect of a labor triage checklist and ultrasound on obstetric referral at three primary health centers in Eastern Uganda [^1117dedv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nearly three‐quarters of the estimated 295 000 annual maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric complications and half of 2.6 million third‐trimester stillbirths occur during labor and delivery. 1, 2 Improved quality of care, particularly during the intrapartum period, can reduce preventable maternal and perinatal mortality. In many low‐ and middle‐income countries, failure to receive adequate care when a facility is reached, the third delay, 3 is exacerbated by lack of supplies, personnel shortages, long waiting times, and weak referral protocols. 4

Effective referral from primary health centers (PHCs) to hospitals offering comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care is a critical component of quality maternity care. 5 Inter‐facility referral relies on a confluence of factors, such as timely arrival of a woman in labor, appropriate identification of high‐risk conditions by providers, emergency transportation, and communication between the referring and receiving facilities. 6 However, inconsistent understanding of clinical criteria for referral, guideline non‐compliance, inadequate clinical skills, lack of confidence in decision‐making, and absence of transportation remain critical gaps at PHCs. 7, 8, 9 These barriers are exacerbated by weak communication across the health system, and further delays when a referral hospital is reached.

Labor triage, when a woman first presents to the PHC maternity unit in labor, is an opportunity to screen for conditions that may warrant referral, especially in contexts where prenatal care screening is poor. Although the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist begins with "Does mother need referral?", standardized assessments before decision to admit, refer, or send home are not included. 10 Triage practices at higher‐level referral facilities in resource constrained settings have been explored, such as implementation of a Traffic Light System, interactive training programs, and standardized documentation 11, 12; however, these interventions have not been introduced at the PHC level.

This study aimed to evaluate if triage interventions — a checklist, focused ultrasound scan and referral transportation support — improved the ability of PHC midwives to correctly diagnose high‐risk conditions and appropriately initiate referral to the district hospital (DH).

### Addressing the third delay: implementing a novel obstetric triage system in Ghana [^116jd8p8]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2010, the United Nations stated that 'we know what works' to provide adequate healthcare to prevent maternal mortality. However, approximately 300 000 women, predominantly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC), died last year due to pregnancy-related complications. The lifetime risk of maternal death has fallen from 1 in 16 to 1 in 36 pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but these women still face risks of death 500–1000 times higher than women in high-income countries. This disparity continues due to failure to implement what we know works into clinical practice.

During the Millennium Development Goal era, access to skilled birth attendance improved. Greater recognition of complicated pregnancies, however, shifts the burden of care to facilities that may be unprepared to provide the signal functions of comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC). It is estimated that at least 15% of births will require transfer of care to CEmOC facilities. The actions taken by these facilities to quickly assess and treat already compromised women are critical to improving survival. Existing reports on delay within facilities, termed 'the third delay' suggest that women who need CEmOC often experience long treatment delays after reaching LMIC health facilities. Yet, there are inconsistent definitions of what constitutes delay, differing study methodologies and little evidence on the effect of delay on birth outcomes. One review states, 'the third delay is likely to be a source of considerable inequity in access to emergency obstetric care in developing countries'.

The invasive nature of blood sampling, reliance on expensive, lengthy central laboratory procedures and skilled personnel, and difficulty in interpreting results relative to GA intervals and from different platforms may have played a role. The aforementioned factors hinder practical implementation of testing for PE in the real-world and even more so in low-resourced countries where morbidity and mortality from PE and eclampsia are the highest. The operational simplicity of the CRD Paper Test fulfills the current needs for a diagnostic tool to aid in the rapid assessment and triage of women with uncertain PE diagnosis.

Traditionally, PE is defined as new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Some members of the obstetrical community seem to hold firm to the view that PE is easy to diagnose. This position is difficult to support based on our pragmatic study design. We found that physicians who are unaware of the CRD Paper Test results admit approximately a third of triaged patients due to diagnostic uncertainty. In this group, after extensive, lengthy and expensive inpatient work-up, only 9% of initially triaged women ultimately received a diagnosis of PE and had MIDPE. This is not surprising. PE is a heterogeneous unpredictable syndrome with a large spectrum of medical signs and symptoms resulting in a variety of clinical phenotypes and outcomes. In triage, clinicians take repeated blood pressure measurements and obtain information about headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, epigastric pain which none are specific to PE. As it was determined from the demographic characteristics of our population the majority of the women presenting in triage are obese and already hypertensive. Because history and physical examination have limited accuracy in such population, and cannot be used alone for management decisions, the CRD Paper Test is uniquely positioned to increase the effectiveness of the triage process and possibly reduce health care costs. Specifically, the CRD Paper Test has the potential to cut the need for triage referrals, decrease the turn-around time for diagnosis, and shorten the length of stay in obstetrical triage and antepartum units by eliminating unnecessary hospital admissions and/or early deliveries. A recent U.S. healthcare utilization analysis that included both maternal and neonatal costs estimated that in 2012 the incremental cost of deliveries was $2·18 billion for the first 12 months after delivery of a mother with PE and $1·15 billion for infants born to mothers with PE. These calculations underscore the importance of an accurate test to diagnose PE.

### Quality improvement initiative: improving obstetric triaging practices in a rural maternal hospital in central India [^116kHzaV]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Obstetrical emergencies are life-threatening medical problems that develop during pregnancy, labour or delivery. Both the mother and the child's health may be jeopardised. An effective obstetric unit must care for patients in a variety of emergency scenarios, ranging from minor problems to life-threatening serious conditions. Triage is the practice of prioritising patients based on the severity of their problems so that they can receive the best care possible in the shortest amount of time. When triaged accurately, patients receive care in an appropriate and timely manner by emergency care providers. During the last decade, obstetric triage is one of the latest services to emerge. A successful contemporary obstetric triage paradigm is one that addresses the questions of 'sick or not sick' and 'labour or no labour' for every obstetric patient that presents for care. Triage algorithms for obstetric acuity are effective in assessing and prioritising obstetric patients. Triage acuity scales such as the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), the Emergency Severity Index and the Manchester Triage System have only a limited number of obstetric determinants and hence are unsuitable to be used as an obstetric triage tool. Hence, the London Health Sciences Centre developed the OTAS based on the five-category CTAS tool.OTAS consists of five levels: critical, emergency, urgent, semiurgent and non-urgent. The scale is based on disease severity and acuity and is colour-coded into blue, red, yellow, green and grey according to severity. It includes a comprehensive set of obstetrical presenting complaints organised by categories of signs and symptoms, along with assessment of maternal vital signs, fetal status and the suggested response time. OTAS enables standardised assessments of acuity within and across institutions. Further, it facilitates assessment of patient care and flow based on acuity. OTAS has been shown to have higher reliability than other obstetric triage index tools, and hence we decided to adopt it as our triage index tool. Application of such obstetric triage scales has been shown to improve maternal and fetal outcomes, reduce patient waiting times in hospitals and prioritise care based on acuity.

### Exploring the third delay: an audit evaluating obstetric triage at mulago national referral hospital [^114eDAK4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mulago National Referral Hospital has the largest maternity unit in sub-Saharan Africa. It is situated in Uganda, where the maternal mortality ratio is 310 per 100,000 live births. In 2010 a 'Traffic Light System' was set up to rapidly triage the vast number of patients who present to the hospital every day. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the obstetric department's triage system at Mulago Hospital with regard to time spent in admissions and to identify urgent cases and factors adversely affecting the system.

Methods

A prospective audit of the obstetric admissions department was carried out at the Mulago Hospital. Data were obtained from tagged patient journeys using two data collection tools and compiled using Microsoft Excel. StatsDirect was used to compose graphs to illustrate the results.

Results

Informal triage was occurring 46% of the time at the first checkpoint in a woman's journey, but the 'Traffic Light System' was not being used and many of the patient's vital signs were not being recorded.

Conclusions

It is hypothesised that the 'Traffic Light System' is not being used due to its focus on examination finding and diagnosis, implying that it is not suitable for an early stage in the patient's journey. Replacing it with a simple algorithm to categorise women into the urgency with which they need to be seen could rectify this.

### Defining high-risk emergency chief complaints: data-driven triage for low-and middle-income countries [^111Yo9uo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Global Emergency Care has maintained a prospectively collected quality assurance database of all emergency unit visits since 2009. The database captures data including demographics, CCs, vital signs, laboratory and radiology results, treatments given, procedures, diagnoses, disposition, and patient outcomes. Data were collected by trained research assistants at the time patients presented for care. Follow‐up data were collected in person for admitted patients and by structured telephone interview within 3 days for patients who were discharged from the emergency unit. If a patient could not be reached on the initial attempt, calls were made daily until 10 days had elapsed since the initial visit. CCs were entered as unstructured free text with the ability to enter multiple CCs for each patient visit.

The study population included all adults 18 years of age and older who presented to the Karoli Lwanga Hospital emergency unit between November 2009 and December 2018. All patients who were "dead on arrival" were excluded. This exclusion applied only to patients who arrived at triage clearly dead; with no vital signs; who received no treatments; and who, by definition, were unable to provide any CC. Patients who arrived at triage with signs of life but died while in the emergency unit were included in analysis. All patients with "pregnancy‐related" complaints were also excluded. This exclusion applied only to patients who presented for emergencies associated with a known pregnancy. Hospital policy dictated that patients with pregnancy‐related emergencies were supposed to be evaluated and treated in a maternity ward housed in a separate building from the main emergency department. Since those patients were explicitly not intended to be seen at the study site they were excluded from analysis. Patients for whom a pregnancy was discovered during evaluation (e.g. for vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain) were included in analysis. Patient visit data were abstracted from the quality assurance database and randomly split into two data sets: one that included 75% of cases for derivation and one with 25% of cases for validation. The derivation data set was subsequently split into two groups: patients with a single CC and patients with multiple CCs.

### The obstetric and gynecological service providers' and recipients' perception and experience of the quality of obstetric triage services during the COVID-19 pandemic in iran [^1128CZwL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Another concept in the present study is "communication with the patient which is neglected under COVID_19 conditions". Communication is essential for obtaining an accurate history and collecting necessary information to make the right diagnosis. The results of other studies have shown that proper communication between health care service providers and recipients was a significant factor in providing effective and dynamic care. According to these studies, the heath care service recipients expect to be appropriately treated by heath care providers and receive good quality of care during the triage process. Establishing relationships for triage is necessary to assess the clinical situation. The assessment includes subcategories such as general condition, time factor, threats, pain, parameter, physical examination and an overview, the result of which indicates prioritization.

In the research Rashidi-Fakari with title "The Quality of the Maternity Triage Process: a Qualitative Study" concluded that most participants identified care as the main factor in the quality of the delivery triage process. Standardization and adaptation of procedures and criteria in care in both examination and history taking are effective in the quality of the process of providing maternity triage services. Incorrect initial assessments, especially during triage, have been reported to increase errors and cause complications and complications.

Another concept in the present study is the following: "Accountability is required to improve the provision of service under the condition of COVID-19 pandemic". Accountability is one of the main goals considered by policy makers and health systems managers. According to the World Health Organization report in 2000, one of the three fundamental goals of health systems is to meet the patients' needs, because any system must attempt to meet the legitimate needs of its service recipients in order to be successful. Accountability has recently gained an increasing significance since it is associated with patient satisfaction. Additionally, improving accountability can increase the sense of comfort and better cooperation between health care service recipients and providers; therefore, it is expected to lead to the ever-increasing health of the society. Health care providers in the obstetric triage would further feel the need to meet pregnant women's needs as they are considered as a highly susceptible group. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important to provide pregnant women with high quality health care services to achieve greater satisfaction.

### Implementing an obstetric triage acuity scale: interrater reliability and patient flow analysis [^1151WF7U]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

A 5-category Obstetric Triage Acuity Scale (OTAS) was developed with a comprehensive set of obstetrical determinants. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to test the interrater reliability of OTAS and (2) to determine the distribution of patient acuity and flow by OTAS level. To test the interrater reliability, 110 triage charts were used to generate vignettes and the consistency of the OTAS level assigned by 8 triage nurses was measured. OTAS performed with substantial (Kappa, 0.61–0.77, OTAS 1–4) and near perfect correlation (0.87, OTAS 5). To assess patient flow, the times to primary and secondary health care provider assessments and lengths of stay stratified by acuity were abstracted from the patient management system. Two-thirds of triage visits were low acuity (OTAS 4, 5). There was a decrease in length of stay (median [interquartile range], minutes) as acuity decreased from OTAS 1 (120.0 [156.0] minutes) to OTAS 3 (75.0 [120.8]). The major contributor to length of stay was time to secondary health care provider assessment and this did not change with acuity. The percentage of patients admitted to the antenatal or birthing unit decreased from 80% (OTAS 1) to 12% (OTAS 5). OTAS provides a reliable assessment of acuity and its implementation has allowed for triaging of obstetric patients based on acuity, and a more in-depth assessment of the patient flow. By standardizing assessment, OTAS allows for opportunities to improve performance and make comparisons of patient care and flow across organizations.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: staged management of surgical services for gynecology and obstetrics [^113WfZFc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic warrants an unprecedented global healthcare response requiring maintenance of existing hospital-based services while simultaneously preparing for high-acuity care for infected and sick individuals. Hospitals must protect patients and the diverse healthcare workforce by conserving personal protective equipment and redeployment of facility resources. While each hospital or health system must evaluate their own capabilities and surge capacity, we present principles of management of surgical services during a health emergency and provide specific guidance to help with decision making. We review the limited evidence from past hospital and community responses to various health emergencies and focus on systematic methods for adjusting surgical services to create capacity, addressing the specific risks of coronavirus disease 2019. Successful strategies for tiered reduction of surgical cases involve multidisciplinary engagement of the entire healthcare system and use of a structured risk-assessment categorization scheme that can be applied across the institution. Our institution developed and operationalized this approach over 3 working days, indicating that immediate implementation is feasible in response to an unforeseen healthcare emergency.

### An interrater reliability study on the gothenburg obstetric triage system-a new obstetric triage system [^113cMa6D]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Triage, identifying patients with critical and time-sensitive disorders, is an integrated process in general emergency medicine. Obstetric triage is more specialised, requiring assessment of both woman, fetus and labour status. Failure to identify severely ill obstetric patients has repeatedly led to maternal morbidity and mortality. Reliable triage systems, adapted to obstetric patients as well as local conditions, are thus essential. The study aims to assess the interrater reliability (IRR) of the Gothenburg Obstetric Triage System (GOTS).

Methods

Midwives (n = 6) and registered nurses with no experience in managing obstetric patients (n = 7), assessed 30 paper cases based on actual real-life cases, using the GOTS. Furthermore, a reference group consisting of two midwives and two obstetricians, with extensive experience in obstetric care, determined the correct triage level in order to enable analysis of over- and undertriage. IRR was assessed, both with percentage of absolute agreement and with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

A total of 388 assessments were performed, comprising all five levels of acuity in the GOTS. Absolute agreement was found in 69.6% of the assessments. The overall IRR was good, with a Kappa value of 0.78 (0.69–0.87, 95% CI) for final triage level. Comparison with reference group assessments established that over- and undertriage had occurred in 9% and 21% of the cases, respectively. The main reasons for undertriage were "not acknowledging abnormal vital sign parameters" and "limitations in study design".

Conclusion

The GOTS is a reliable tool for triaging obstetric patients. It enables a standardized triage process unrelated to the assessors' level of experience in assessing and managing obstetric patients and is applicable for triaging obstetric patients presenting for emergency care at obstetric or emergency units.

### Development and validation of an obstetric early warning system model for use in low resource settings [^1138dNcM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Of the seven parameters in the proposed EWS algorithm (Table 5 and Additional file 2), five (temperature, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and consciousness level) were included in the majority (> 80%) of EWSs published to date. Delays in triage (identification of who is, or may become, severely ill and should be provided with a higher level of care) are believed to contribute immensely to an increased burden of adverse obstetric outcomes in this settings. This is further confounded by the unavailability of patient monitoring devices and other diagnostic equipment, especially in primary healthcare settings. Therefore, in addition to inpatient obstetric wards, we believe the proposed algorithm can present a potentially useful triaging tool to aid timely referral in primary healthcare centres in LMICs. However, prospective external validation is recommended to assess the effectiveness of this tool in primary, secondary and tertiary care in other low resource settings to substantiate these recommendations.

### Benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of cervical screening, triage and treatment strategies for women in the general population [^111ZuKz2]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Evaluation process

The WHO's updated cervical screening guidelines were informed by a range of evidence sources, including an updated systematic review on screening test performance and treatment efficacy and a modeled evaluation. To guide this update, the WHO secretariat formed the Guidelines Development Group and consulted with methodologists and technical groups to determine Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) questions, timelines and methodology.

The updated guideline addressed optimal primary and triage test technologies, optimal screening frequency and intervals, optimal management of women under surveillance after testing triage negative at the primary visit and optimal management of women after treatment for pre-cancer. The modeling evaluation for both the general population of women and women living with HIV assesses a range of primary and triage test technologies and a range of screening ages and frequencies, incorporating data on updated systematic review evidence, costing data and screening algorithms.

The Guidelines Development Group identified seven priority algorithms that would be potentially suitable for LMICs: primary VIA, primary cytology with HPV triage (ASC-US referral), primary HPV without triage (all positive women treated after using assessment of eligibility for ablative treatment), primary HPV 16/18 triage, primary HPV VIA triage, primary HPV cytology triage and primary HPV colposcopy triage screening strategies (Supplementary Table 1). To ensure adequate communication among the different expert groups involved in informing the update of cervical screening guidelines, weekly meetings were held among the modeling team, representatives from the WHO secretariat and representatives from the systematic review and costing teams. Regular meetings were also held among members of the Guidelines Development Group members and the systematic review, modeling and costing teams to discuss the priority management algorithms.

The modeled evaluation was performed over a three-stage process (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the first stage, we evaluated the benefits and harms (using pre-cancer treatments as a proxy for harms) of the seven priority algorithms, considering various screening ages and frequencies. These results were presented to the Guidelines Development Group in July 2020. In the second stage, we included results on additional adverse obstetric outcomes as a result of pre-cancer treatments as another measure of the harms associated with screening as well as cost-effectiveness outcomes. Modeled evaluations of these algorithms were presented to the Guidelines Development Group in September 2020. The third stage involved a detailed exploration of the optimal management of women after negative triage test and the optimal management of women after treatment for pre-cancer. Modeled evaluations of these alternative management options were presented to the Guidelines Development Group in November 2020.

### Exploring the third delay: an audit evaluating obstetric triage at mulago national referral hospital [^1129Q9iK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Recommendations

As previously mentioned, a key recommendation would be to repeat the research over a longer period of time using local staff. This study does, however, give some indications as to where and why the delays occur.

The fact that sphygmomanometers were not always available on the wards definitely contributed to delays in patients' journeys as well as unrecorded blood pressures. It is likely that even a small injection of funds to ensure a sphygmomanometer on each ward would dramatically increase the number of patients who had their blood pressure recorded and even prevent some delays.

Ideally, more staff would be employed or allocated to admissions, in particular to ensure that there is always a member of staff present in the admissions room at night and during shift changes. Increasing staff numbers would also ensure that a midwife could be specifically allocated to triage. However, taking into account the finite resources and staff of Mulago hospital, this may not be immediately possible and should thus be considered a long term goal.

At the moment triage is informal, as discussed above. It usually occurs when midwives decide who to bring into the admissions room next. Triage should ideally happen as early as possible in a patient's journey, with a rapid assessment that involves a brief history and examination. In the case of Mulago, this would mean that women were triaged in the admissions room, as there is a suitable space for a basic examination. However, due to volume of patients, this would mean that many patients would have to wait hours for triage, which is not a suitable option. Therefore, the most appropriate solution appears to be that women are assessed at the admissions desk using a brief history and observations, which would allow all women to be triaged early in their journey. Although observations at the desk do not suffice for a full examination, this process should still identify women who need to be seen more urgently. As the admission desk is the most suitable place for this to occur, it may be appropriate to adapt the current Traffic Light System, and thus remove the need for examination or a diagnosis to categorise people.

### Effect of a labor triage checklist and ultrasound on obstetric referral at three primary health centers in Eastern Uganda [^114Y27Tx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We examined the phased implementation of triage interventions at three PHCs in Busoga region, Uganda, between February 2018 and July 2019. In 2016, 60% of Ugandan women received four prenatal care visits and the median length of pregnancy at entry to prenatal care was 4.7 months. 13

The three study PHCs provide 24‐hour delivery services without cesarean delivery capacity, conduct 60–75 monthly deliveries, and are located 11, 25, and 41 km from the DH. On average, each PHC has five midwives on staff with each shift covered by one midwife in the labor room and another in prenatal care. The standard of care guidance is to refer to higher care for the conditions of interest (detailed below) unless delivery is imminent. Other conditions including obstructed/prolonged labor, previous cesarean section, pre‐eclamptic toxemia, and antepartum hemorrhage, also warrant referral. Ambulances are accessible, but patients pay money for fuel or rely on their own means to reach the DH. Ultrasounds were not available before the study.

The study's primary outcome was the proportion of women with one or more of six high‐risk conditions confirmed at birth who were referred upon initial PHC presentation. The conditions (preterm birth, multiple gestation, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, malpresentation, and abnormal fetal heart rate) were combined into one composite variable for the primary analysis. The following criteria were used to confirm presence of a complication at outcome: multiple gestation, more than one fetus present; preterm birth, gestational age by Ballard examination; oligohydramnios, reduced amniotic fluid at birth without rupture of membranes; placenta previa, if reported by vaginal examination or cesarean section; malpresentation, non‐cephalic presenting fetal part; abnormal fetal heart rate, 1‐minute Apgar scores less than 7 or infant born without signs of life.

### An interrater reliability study on the gothenburg obstetric triage system-a new obstetric triage system [^112uTU6W]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Like the absolute majority of triage systems, the GOTS was developed within the local context of guidelines and clinical setting, and the generalizability may thus be limited. The fact that the selection of cases did not correspond to the actual patient flow in the real-life setting may have biased the assessors to assess the cases according to the expected percentage of cases within each level of acuity. However, the cases were selected consecutively during a period of 2 months in order to represent all of the chief complaint algorithm and the five acuity levels in the GOTS, which was deemed essential.

### Triage of pregnant women in the emergency department: evaluation of a triage decision aid [^111zdtZS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Applying the Australasian Triage Scale to pregnant women presenting to emergency departments (EDs) is difficult as the descriptors may not reflect the urgency of the obstetric condition. This study aimed to examine whether condition-specific algorithms and triage education improved triage assessment and documentation of pregnant women presenting to the ED.

Method

Algorithms with a decision aid for triage with minimum agreed descriptors were developed to triage two pregnancy conditions (pre-eclampsia and antepartum haemorrhage). Triage documentation was then audited before (n = 50) and after (n = 50) a triage education programme which introduced algorithms for both conditions. Significant differences were examined using χ(2) test with significance set at p < 0.05.

Results

The quality of documentation of specific clinically significant symptoms of pre-eclampsia improved considerably, including the presence of headache from 58% pre-education to 80% post-education (p = 0.002), visual disturbances from 58% to 90% (p < 0.001), epigastric pain from 24% to 80% (p = 0.002) and the presence of fetal movements from 62% to 90% (p = 0.001). Documentation of descriptors for vaginal bleeding > 20 weeks gestation improved for estimation of blood loss from 54% to 86% (p < 0.001), patient 'appearance' from 32% to 62% (p = 0.003) and, importantly, descriptions of patient's own assessment of their well-being from 8% to 28% (p = 0.009).

Conclusion

The introduction of triage education and condition-specific decision aids for triage markedly improved triage assessment and documentation. The application of algorithms may reduce clinical risk resulting from suboptimal triage of pregnant women presenting to EDs.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114QVy2W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality". History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss". Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia", and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB". Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants", and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia".

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113N6fUh]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

OB/GYN — Obstetrical and Gynecological Conditions — prehospital care includes specific monitoring, interventions, and safety directives. Monitor EKG if history of syncope or lightheadedness, and monitor pulse oximetry if signs of hypotension or respiratory symptoms. If signs of shock or orthostasis: Position patient supine or in the left lateral recumbent position if third trimester and keep patient warm, place large bore IV, Volume resuscitation: crystalloid 1–2 liters IV wide open, Reassess vital signs and response to fluid resuscitation, and Save all possible tissue so that the receiving team can assess. Disposition – transport emergently to closest appropriate receiving facility – notify en route if possible so the receiving team may prepare. Patient safety considerations state: Patients in third trimester of pregnancy should be transported on left side or with uterus manually displaced to left if hypotensive, and Do not place hand/fingers into vagina of bleeding patient except in cases of prolapsed cord or breech birth that is not progressing. Syncope can be a presenting symptom of intraabdominal hemorrhage from ectopic pregnancy or antepartum hemorrhage from spontaneous abortion, placental abruption, or placenta previa. Pertinent assessment findings include: Vital signs to assess for signs of shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension).

### Management of patients with sexually transmitted infections in the emergency department [^112C9q4o]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are very common infections in the United States. Most patients with STIs are evaluated and treated in primary care settings; however, many also present to the Emergency Department (ED) for initial care. Management of STIs in the ED includes appropriate testing and treatment per CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines. Although most patients with STIs are asymptomatic or may only exhibit mild symptoms, serious complications from untreated infection are possible. Pregnant women with STIs are particularly vulnerable to serious complications; therefore, empiric ED treatment combined with close follow-up care and referral to obstetrics are paramount.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^114M7LCL]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

PDSA cycle 5

The acquisition of acuity tools, guideline and structural changes is essential but inefficient without the presence of dedicated staff to ensure smooth workflow and continuous monitoring of the process. Similarly, care providers understanding and knowledge of implemented process is essential and if not trained properly, they can be the cause for delay in service provision. To ensure effective transformation, for our fifth cycle, changes were made in the existing staffing model. Dedicated nursing staff (one staff for triage area and one for triage room) and physicians were appointed in shifts for smooth running of the triage process. With additional staff arrangements, the area was staffed 24 hours a day to meet the needs of our pregnant patients.

We trained our triage care providers for improved high-quality care. On-the-job training sessions were held for nurses and obstetricians to assist with the evolution of the process. A dedicated, 8-hour workshop was conducted for obstetric triage module covering essential concepts of triage definitions, and triage system including re-triage, urgency, and triage scale, this also encompassed possible outcomes: under and over triage, correct triage decision, communication issues, and pain assessment at triage. New triage guidelines, acuity tool, flow process, documentation requirements, infectious disease screening and isolation type, were introduced and practised. For evaluation component, case-based assessments and skill sign off was done. The workshops took place once every 3 months.

To maintain quality assurance, reinforcement of the process was ensured to the nursing staff as part of daily huddles. This was further reinforced by the time-to-time assessments of nursing performance on actual patients. For its quality assurance, routine monitoring by clinical quality lead was ensured.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^113rUdAX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Women attending a single maternity unit (St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK) presenting with RFM after 36 weeks gestation between October 2011 and August 2012 were invited to participate. The protocol was given a favourable ethical opinion by the Greater Manchester North Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0664) and was registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN07944306). Women were excluded if there was a known congenital anomaly, multiple pregnancy, the fetus required immediate delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate trace, maternal age was less than 16 years or they were unable to give informed consent.

Recruitment

Women meeting the inclusion criteria were approached by the research midwife (GB) either during their attendance at the maternity day unit (MDU) if between 9 am–5 pm or on the morning after attending the obstetric triage service outside normal hours (5 pm–9 am). Women approached during attendance at MDU were given information during the initial fetal heart rate assessment which lasted approximately 45 minutes. Women were then randomised to standard or intensive management groups by computer, using individual randomisation in a 1:1 ratio with random variable block size. This was facilitated by the University of Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit. We aimed to randomise 120 patients in total, giving 60 patients in each arm of the study. From our previous studies we anticipated a loss to follow-up of < 5% (3 participants per arm) and estimated that 150 women would need to be approached to recruit 120 participants. In addition, demographic data were collected on non-participants to determine whether there were differences between participants and non-participants.

### The problem with how we view medical (and diagnostic) error in emergency medicine [^1147p7xA]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This case is an example of when a correct and timely preliminary diagnosis is necessary in EM. Because a procedure is required to treat a specific pathophysiology, both the preliminary diagnosis (pneumothorax) and the laterality (left‐sided) are necessary to appropriately treat the patient. However, even in this instance, we can see that the diagnostic process started with triage evaluation based on physical examination, progressed to initial diagnosis based on the quick read of available diagnostics, and then evolved to a final diagnosis after evaluating the preliminary diagnosis within the context of the patient presentation ("why does my left side hurt?") and with the input from other care team members ("the patient either has situs inversus or this is a mirror image"). Is an incorrect preliminary diagnosis an error if it is appropriately adjusted when evaluated within the context of the patient presentation or is this expected evolution and merely demonstrative of the necessity of context experts at the bed side to cope with complexity and uncertainty?

Discussion

Our study demonstrates the feasibility of introducing a CVD risk assessment tool into clinical practice. We integrated a CVD risk assessment tool, the CMQCC algorithm, into the 3 large HNs' EMR. The rates of patients screened for CVD risk differed between sites but, overall, were reasonably good varying between 57.1% and 98.7%. For those with a positive screen, follow-up rates varied between 55.9% and 72.5%. This CVD risk assessment strategy can identify patients at high risk of CVD during pregnancy and the postpartum period and may be helpful in decreasing CVD-related maternal morbidity and mortality.

CVD is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States; a large proportion of deaths were among patients with no prior diagnosis of CVD. This represents either an underlying undiagnosed CVD that was aggravated by the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy or the development of a de novo cardiac condition, ie, peripartum cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy may lead to signs and symptoms that are very similar to those of CVD, and these patients can be either misdiagnosed or their symptoms dismissed, leading to delays in the recognition and treatment of CVD that led to serious short- and long-term morbidities. Thus, there is a need for a standardized risk assessment tool to identify pregnant and postpartum patients at high risk of CVD to allow for timely interventions. While a positive screen for CVD risk may not always lead to a diagnosis of CVD, it may identify early risk factors that require individualized monitoring and management as indicated. A well-developed triage algorithm should be sensitive enough to detect the most concerning cases at risk of CVD without missing patients who are at risk to develop CVD in the future. On September 2, 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced the final research plan for screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy that involves an evaluation of the effectiveness of different screening programs in the reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality. The CVD risk assessment algorithm is an initial step to guide the stratification and initial evaluation of symptomatic or high-risk pregnant or postpartum patients (Central Illustration). It has received support from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and its inclusion in the Cardiac Conditions in Obstetrical Care bundle by the Alliance for Innovation for Maternal Health is pending further research.

### Nonoperative management of pelvic organ prolapse [^113Ssn1k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is defined as the descent of one or more of the anterior, posterior, or apical vagina. It is a common condition, with up to 50% of women having prolapse on examination in their lifetimes. This article provides an overview of the evaluation and discussion of nonoperative management of POP for the obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn), with consideration of recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Urogynecologic Society, and the International Urogynecological Association. The initial evaluation of POP requires a history documenting whether the patient is experiencing symptoms and what they are, and discovery of which symptoms they believe are attributable to prolapse. Examination determines the vaginal compartment(s) and to what degree prolapse exists. In general, only patients who have symptomatic prolapse or medical indication should be offered treatment. Although surgical options exist, all patients who are symptomatic and desire treatment should be offered nonsurgical treatment first, including pelvic floor physical therapy or a pessary trial. Appropriateness, expectations, complications, and counseling points are reviewed. Educational opportunities between the patient and the ob-gyn include disentangling common beliefs that the bladder is dropping or that concomitant urinary or bowel symptoms are necessarily caused by prolapse. Improving patient education can lead to a better understanding of their condition and better alignment of treatment goals and expectations.

### ACOG committee opinion. number 335, may 2006: the initial reproductive health visit [^117Bw6ra]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the first visit to the obstetrician-gynecologist take place between the ages of 13 and 15 years. This visits will provide health guidance, screening, and preventive health care services and provide an excellent opportunity for the obstetrician-gynecologist to start a physician-patient relationship. This visit generally does not include an internal pelvic examination.

### Levels of maternal care: obstetric care consensus No, 9 [^117U5Ki3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Levels of maternal care — summary recommendations and grade: To standardize a complete and integrated regionalized system of perinatal care and risk-appropriate maternal care, a classification system for levels of maternal care as defined in Table 1 is recommended, and each higher level of care includes and builds on the capabilities of the lower levels. All facilities need the capability to stabilize and provide initial care for any patient, manage common obstetric emergencies such as hemorrhage and hypertension, and birth centers, basic (level I), and specialty care (level II) hospitals should collaborate with subspecialty care and regional perinatal health facilities to develop and maintain maternal transport plans and cooperative agreements. Collaborating receiving hospitals should openly accept transfers, and the decision to transfer a patient is dependent on the health care provider's judgment of the severity of illness, balancing the need for a higher level of care with risks associated with moving the woman out of her community. Pregnant women should receive the same level of trauma care as nonpregnant patients, and the appropriate care level for patients should be driven by their medical need and not limited to or governed by financial constraints. Because obesity is extremely common, all facilities should have appropriate equipment for the care and delivery of pregnant women with obesity; the degree of obesity may be 1 of the factors that affect decisions for transfer, and there are no well-established body mass index cutoff levels to determine level-specific care for pregnant women or women in the postpartum period with obesity. All facilities should have infrastructure and guidelines for data collection, storage, and retrieval that allow regular review for trends; levels of maternal and neonatal care may not match within facilities, and a pregnant woman should be cared for at the facility that best meets her needs as well as her neonate's needs. All maternity facilities should have the necessary institutional support, including financial, to meet the needs of level-appropriate maternal care, including provision of health care personnel, facility resources, and collaborative relationships with perinatal hospitals within their region. The grade of recommendations shown is 1C Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.
