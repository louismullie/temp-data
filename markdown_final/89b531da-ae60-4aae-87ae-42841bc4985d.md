## Question

Biologic agent in asthma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting and managing biologic therapy in severe asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of severe asthma and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the inflammatory phenotype using biomarkers and clinical context. Next, I will map phenotype to mechanism-specific biologics and weigh steroid-sparing effects. After that, I need to consider age-specific approvals, comorbidities, and logistics. Then, I should outline a monitoring and response assessment plan, including when to switch or discontinue. Finally, I will integrate step-down strategies and summarize a practical decision framework with key caveats and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of severe asthma and rule out mimics or reversible drivers of poor control, because misclassification is common and costly; I need to check adherence, inhaler technique, and environmental exposures, and I should confirm objective variability in airflow obstruction with spirometry or FeNO while excluding vocal cord dysfunction, bronchiectasis, cardiac disease, and other mimics, ideally with specialist input if the patient is at Step 4 or higher or not improving with optimization [^116eivKt] [^1178TNY9].

> Wait, let me verify the inflammatory phenotype before choosing a biologic; I should double-check blood eosinophils, FeNO, and consider sputum eosinophils if available, repeating measurements off or at the lowest feasible OCS dose to avoid steroid confounding, and I should remember that Type 2-high is suggested by eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb, while acknowledging that these biomarkers are imperfect and must be interpreted with clinical context and trends over time [^114u1h56] [^115ab5gn] [^112RyVxo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to map phenotype to mechanism-specific biologics, recognizing that current agents target Type 2 pathways: anti-IgE for allergic asthma, anti–IL-5/IL-5R for eosinophilic disease, anti–IL-4Rα for Type 2–high or OCS-dependent asthma, and anti-TSLP as phenotype-agnostic for severe asthma, while remembering that overlapping eligibility is common and head-to-head trials are lacking, so selection must be individualized and evidence-informed rather than assumed superior for any single agent [^116CCrrU] [^112RyVxo] [^111MNkTF].

> I will now examine the role of allergic sensitization and IgE; if the patient has allergic asthma with perennial allergen sensitization and IgE within the labeled dosing range, omalizumab is appropriate and has long-standing efficacy and safety, though I should confirm age-specific IgE ranges and consider that non-atopic patients or those with very high IgE may respond less well, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^1112FWbR] [^115UJMaf] [^116y4jjw].

> Next, I should review eosinophilic asthma; for patients with elevated blood eosinophils, anti–IL-5 agents reduce exacerbations and can be steroid-sparing, with higher eosinophil counts predicting greater benefit, and I need to check agent-specific thresholds used in trials and labels to guide expectations, while also noting that anti–IL-5Rα (benralizumab) induces near-complete eosinophil depletion and may be advantageous in very high eosinophil phenotypes [^114A6gG1] [^115axpY8] [^111i6wYB].

> Let me consider Type 2–high or OCS-dependent asthma; dupilumab, which blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling, has robust steroid-sparing effects and improves symptoms and lung function in Type 2–high disease, so if the phenotype is mixed or OCS dependence is a key goal, dupilumab is a strong candidate, and I should confirm that the patient's Type 2 features are present to optimize response probability [^111i6wYB] [^116CCrrU].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is unclear or mixed; tezepelumab, which targets TSLP upstream of Type 2 pathways, has broad eligibility and can reduce exacerbations across phenotypes, so when biomarkers are discordant or the patient does not fit cleanly into allergic or eosinophilic buckets, tezepelumab is a reasonable option, though I should confirm age eligibility and discuss the limited steroid-sparing data compared with some other biologics [^116CCrrU] [^1165xLLp].

> I need to ensure age-appropriate approvals are respected; omalizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab are approved down to age 6 for selected phenotypes, benralizumab and tezepelumab are approved from age 12, and reslizumab is IV and approved for adults ≥ 18, so I should match the mechanism to the child's phenotype and age, and I should also remember that pediatric data are more limited and that shared decision-making with caregivers is essential [^116CCrrU] [^116xJyY6] [^114o81fd].

> Hold on, I should verify comorbidities that sway biologic choice; chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis can favor agents like dupilumab or omalizumab that also benefit these conditions, and registry data suggest patients with nasal polyposis may have greater improvements in exacerbations and control on biologics, so I should actively screen for and leverage these comorbidities in selection and counseling [^111gvo8n] [^1173c3aU] [^112RyVxo].

> I should double-check practicalities that affect adherence and outcomes; route and frequency matter, with SC options generally preferred over IV, and I need to discuss access, cost, and monitoring requirements, including post-injection observation for hypersensitivity, especially early in therapy with omalizumab or anti–IL-5 agents, and I should plan for home administration where appropriate to reduce burden [^114jARUB] [^112JxorH] [^113oJjxV].

> Next, I should review how to monitor response; a minimum 4-month trial is reasonable to assess control, exacerbations, lung function, OCS use, and side effects, and I should also track Type 2 comorbidity benefits where relevant; if response is suboptimal, I should reassess adherence, technique, and comorbidities, and consider switching mechanisms rather than prematurely abandoning biologics, as switching can improve outcomes when the initial choice is mismatched [^111i6wYB] [^111whaXK] [^114LYmkh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tezepelumab had clear steroid-sparing data comparable to anti–IL-5 agents or dupilumab; let me reconsider and verify the evidence, because contemporary summaries indicate tezepelumab did not demonstrate a significant reduction in maintenance OCS dose in glucocorticoid-dependent populations, so I should not overstate its steroid-sparing effect when setting expectations or choosing among agents for OCS-dependent patients [^1165xLLp].

> I should confirm when and how to step down; GINA advises that for patients with a good response, biologic withdrawal is generally not considered until after at least 12 months of treatment and only if asthma remains well controlled on medium-dose ICS-containing therapy without ongoing OCS need, and when stepping down, I should taper OCS first, then consider ICS reduction, with close monitoring for relapse and a low threshold to resume prior effective therapy [^114JybtT] [^113EvJVp] [^116RJgLJ].

> Let me think about remission as a therapeutic goal; while definitions vary, on-treatment remission encompassing minimal symptoms, no exacerbations, near-normal lung function, and no OCS is achievable in a subset, with predictors including better baseline control, fewer comorbidities, earlier disease onset, and lower OCS exposure, so I should discuss remission as an aspirational target and align follow-up to track progress toward that goal [^116bRNCH] [^1114LnqG] [^113LVvZ8].

> I should double-check the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency: confirm severe asthma and optimize basics, phenotype with biomarkers and clinical context, match mechanism to phenotype and goals including steroid sparing, incorporate age approvals and comorbidities, address logistics, monitor for at least 4 months, switch mechanisms if inadequate, and pursue step-down only after sustained control, all within shared decision-making and specialist oversight given the complexity and cost of these therapies [^116eivKt] [^111MNkTF] [^112RyVxo].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties; head-to-head trials are lacking, biomarkers are imperfect, pediatric evidence is thinner, and cost and access can limit choices, so I should document the rationale for the selected biologic, set measurable targets, and schedule reassessment to confirm benefit or trigger a switch, keeping the patient's goals and risk tolerance front and center [^111MNkTF] [^116pkF4Q] [^114Tjudn].

Biologic agents are monoclonal antibodies that target specific inflammatory pathways in severe asthma, **reducing exacerbations, improving lung function, and enabling steroid sparing** [^115YSPCv] [^111MNkTF]. They are indicated for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma despite high-dose ICS-LABA, with selection guided by phenotype and biomarkers such as eosinophils, FeNO, and IgE [^116CCrrU] [^114u1h56]. Current options include anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti–IL-5/IL-5R (mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab), anti–IL-4Rα (dupilumab), and anti-TSLP (tezepelumab), each with distinct mechanisms and eligibility criteria [^116CCrrU] [^111i6wYB]. Biologics are generally well tolerated, but monitoring for hypersensitivity and infections is required, and cost and access remain barriers [^114LYmkh] [^113yCoau].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Biologics target specific inflammatory pathways in asthma, **providing targeted therapy** based on disease phenotype [^115YSPCv]:

| **Biologic agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Targeted pathway** |
|-|-|-|
| Omalizumab | Binds IgE, preventing its interaction with FcεRI receptors | Anti-IgE |
| Mepolizumab | Binds IL-5, inhibiting eosinophil differentiation and survival | Anti–IL-5 |
| Benralizumab | Binds IL-5Rα, inducing eosinophil apoptosis via ADCC | Anti–IL-5R |
| Reslizumab | Binds IL-5, inhibiting eosinophil proliferation | Anti–IL-5 |
| Dupilumab | Blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling via IL-4Rα | Anti–IL-4Rα |
| Tezepelumab | Blocks TSLP, inhibiting upstream type 2 inflammation | Anti-TSLP |

---

## Clinical indications and patient selection

Biologics are indicated for patients with **severe asthma** who remain uncontrolled despite optimized inhaled therapy, with selection guided by phenotype and biomarkers [^116CCrrU] [^114u1h56]:

- **Omalizumab**: Severe allergic asthma (≥ 6 years) with IgE sensitization [^1112FWbR].
- **Mepolizumab**: Severe eosinophilic asthma (≥ 6 years) [^116CCrrU].
- **Benralizumab**: Severe eosinophilic asthma (≥ 12 years) [^116CCrrU].
- **Reslizumab**: Severe eosinophilic asthma (≥ 18 years, IV only) [^116CCrrU].
- **Dupilumab**: Severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma or OCS-dependent asthma (≥ 6 years) [^111i6wYB].
- **Tezepelumab**: Severe asthma (≥ 12 years), phenotype-agnostic [^111i6wYB].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Biologics have **demonstrated significant clinical benefits** in severe asthma:

- **Exacerbation reduction**: 30–70% reduction in annual exacerbation rates [^notfound].
- **Lung function improvement**: Modest but significant FEV1 improvements [^115YSPCv] [^116BtxBr].
- **Steroid sparing**: Reduced or eliminated need for oral corticosteroids [^115YSPCv] [^111i6wYB].
- **Quality of life**: Improved asthma control and quality of life scores [^115YSPCv] [^114ckC3A].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Biologics are **generally well tolerated**, but clinicians should remain vigilant for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and monitor for infections such as parasitic infestations and respiratory infections. Injection-site reactions are common but typically mild. Long-term safety data are reassuring, though ongoing surveillance is warranted [^114LYmkh] [^114jARUB].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their benefits, biologics have **limitations**:

- **Cost**: High cost limits access and raises cost-effectiveness concerns [^113yCoau].
- **Patient selection**: Biomarkers are imperfect predictors of response; some patients do not respond [^115nsm34].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Data on remission and long-term safety are still evolving [^1114LnqG] [^114LYmkh].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **personalized treatment** based on phenotype, biomarkers, and patient-specific factors [^116CCrrU] [^111MNkTF]. GINA 2025 provides clear recommendations on biologic selection, monitoring, and step-down strategies, and expert consensus supports a pragmatic approach integrating biomarkers, comorbidities, and shared decision-making [^116CCrrU] [^116eivKt] [^116RJgLJ] [^112WzhtR].

---

## Future directions

Emerging research focuses on **novel targets** (e.g. BTK, OX40L, JAK), inhaled biologics, and combination therapies [^115kZmxv]. Efforts to define asthma remission and identify predictors of response are ongoing [^1114LnqG] [^113LVvZ8].

---

Biologic agents represent a **significant advancement** in severe asthma management, offering targeted therapy with substantial clinical benefits. Selection should be phenotype- and biomarker-driven, with careful monitoring for safety and efficacy [^115YSPCv].

### Biologics in severe asthma: a pragmatic approach for choosing the right treatment for the right patient [^112WzhtR]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The development of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting specific components of the pathways relevant to asthma pathophysiology has revolutionized treatment of severe asthma both in adults and children and helped to further unravel the heterogeneity of this disease. However, the availability of multiple agents, often with overlapping eligibility criteria, creates a need for pragmatic guidance for specialists undertaking care of patients with severe asthma. In this review, we provide an overview of the data supporting the clinical efficacy of biologics in distinct asthma phenotypes/endotypes. We also focus on the role of biomarkers and treatable traits, including comorbidities, in the choice of asthma biologics, highlight which treatments have been demonstrated to be steroid sparing in corticosteroid dependent asthma, and provide practical guidance that can drive shared decision making on treatment choice with patients. In addition, we summarize what is known to date regarding long-term safety of these drugs, and lastly, discuss future directions in biologics research.

### Biologic management in severe asthma for adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111MNkTF]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe asthma affects 5–10% of asthma patients but constitutes close to half of the medical costs related to asthma due to higher morbidity and healthcare utilization. Biologic agents have become a standard of care in those unresponsive to standard treatments yet the choice of biologic agent is complex due to the varying mechanisms of action, efficacies, and lack of head-to-head comparisons. Therefore, clinicians need further clinical guidance to optimize their use.

Methods

Panelists developed key clinical questions utilizing the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format to address choice of a biologic agent in severe asthma for adult patients ≥ 18 years old. A comprehensive systematic search was performed using MEDLINE (via OVID), EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL to identify relevant articles, which were then screened for inclusion using document evaluation tools. Each included article underwent quality assessment, data extraction, and pooled analysis to support grade level recommendation for each of the PICO questions.

Results

Our systematic review and critical analysis of the literature on the 7 PICO questions related to choice of biologic agent in severe asthma patients resulted in seven evidence-based recommendations.

Conclusions

Characteristics such as quality of life impairment, baseline lung function, frequency of exacerbation, baseline oral corticosteroid use, asthma endotype, biomarkers and comorbid conditions can impact the biologic choice. Evidence for selecting biologic agents in severe asthma is limited by the absence of comparative effectiveness trials. Additional high-quality evidence is needed to inform choice of biologic agents in these patients.

### A rational approach to compare and select biologic therapeutics in asthma [^112RyVxo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review key literature on asthma biologic therapeutics-currently available and under investigation-to inform a rational approach to select biologics for the management of people with severe asthma by precision medicine.

Data Sources

We used the PubMed database to review literature on biologic therapeutics in asthma.

Study Selections

We included published randomized control trials and real-world studies on biologic therapeutics, available in English, through September 2021.

Results

Increased understanding of asthma endotypes and the roles of various inflammatory mechanisms has led to therapeutic agents that inhibit specific cytokines or immune pathways. Currently available biologic therapeutics target type 2-high asthma. Grouped by mechanisms of action, there are the following 3 types: (1) anti-immunoglobulin E, (2) anti-interleukin (IL)-5 or IL-5 receptor, and (3) anti-IL-4 receptor α. There are also various potential future biologic therapeutics currently under investigation. Although there remains a paucity of data regarding prospective direct head-to-head comparisons of biologic therapeutics in asthma, there are some retrospective and indirect comparison data available.

Conclusion

Precision medicine guides selection of biologic therapeutics along with shared decision-making. Biomarkers, although not comprehensive, allow approximations of likely mechanisms. Use of biomarkers, to include historical levels and trends, in addition to consideration of key clinical characteristics and comorbidities can greatly help guide biologic selection. Efficacy, safety, potential adverse effects, indications for other key comorbidities, and logistics should also be considered.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^114Tjudn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What Is the Role of Asthma Biologics for Severe Asthma?

The Expert Panel acknowledges that there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the different endotypes of severe asthma and the work that has helped to establish the therapeutic use of various monoclonal antibodies ("biologics"; e.g. anti-IL5, anti-IL5 receptor-α, and anti-IL4 receptor-α) for such patients. The absence of recommendations for the use of asthma biologics in the NAEPP 2020 guideline update is a major gap, especially given the rapid pace of discoveries after the priority topics for the update were established. Interested readers are encouraged to review recommendations regarding the use of asthma biologics by other groups, including GINA and the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111Ki8ay]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

2020 focused updates to the 2007 Asthma Guidelines

After the Expert Panel reached consensus on the recommendations, each topic team drafted a narrative to provide further information on each recommendation. These narratives form the body of this report. Each topic narrative has the following sections:
A brief background section that includes definitions of the terms used in the recommendations
The key questions addressed
The recommendations
An Implementation Guidance section that explains the recommendation in greater detail and provides Expert Panel opinion about how to implement the recommendation in clinical practice
A summary of the evidence
The rationale for the recommendation
A discussion of the evidence supporting the recommendation
A list of topic-specific research gaps and questions

Differences (if any) between the new recommendations and the recommendations in EPR-3 are discussed in Appendix A (in this article's Online Repository at).

The Implementation Guidance sections are for practicing clinicians, and they contain the following information:
Clinician's summary (more detailed explanation of the recommendation)
Population most likely to benefit from the recommendation
Any populations to which the recommendation does not apply
Topic-specific considerations
Issues that clinicians should discuss with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process

Review and public comment

The NAEPPCC reviewed an initial draft report. The NHLBI subsequently made the draft report available for public review and comment from December 2, 2019, to January 17, 2020. Interested stakeholders — including health professionals; representatives of the scientific community, academic institutions, the private sector, professional societies, advocacy groups, and patient communities; and other interested members of the public — were invited to submit comments. The Expert Panel received and reviewed approximately 500 comments from almost 100 individuals and organizations, and the panel used this input to revise the draft report.

One or more individuals and organizational representatives who submitted public comments mentioned almost all of the emerging topics. Of the 11 emerging topics (see list toward the beginning of Section I of this report), biologic agents received the most attention. The first biologic agent for asthma received approval from the US FDA in 2003, but the second biologic agent did not receive approval until November 2015. Between November 2015 and November 2017, four biologic agents received approval, but several others were not shown to be effective in clinical trials. Thus, at the time that the priority topics and key questions were developed, the only biologic agent available for use in the United States was omalizumab, which EPR-3 had addressed. The NHLBAC Asthma Expert Working Group did not believe that this single available biologic agent warranted inclusion in the update and included biologic agents as an emerging topic.

### Biologics in asthma – the next step toward personalized treatment [^116t7fgc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma is a multifaceted disease and is associated with significant impairment and risk, and a therapeutic response that is highly variable. Although current treatments are usually effective for patients with mild-to-moderate disease, patients with more severe asthma are often unresponsive to current efforts, and there remains a need for agents with properties that may achieve control in these individuals. There is ongoing research to identify bioactive molecules that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, and many of these have been identified as potential therapeutic targets to improve control of this disease. As a consequence of these efforts, monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested as to their effectiveness in the treatment of asthma. The assessment of these new treatments has identified particular pathways that, in selected patients, have shown benefit. The following review will discuss the current and future use of biological agents for the treatment of asthma, their efficacy, and how certain patient phenotypes and endotypes may be associated with biomarkers that may be used to select treatments to achieve greatest effectiveness of their use. As knowledge of the effects of these biological agents in asthma emerges, as well as the patients in whom they are most beneficial, the movement toward personalized treatment will follow.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of severe asthma: the role of biologic therapies [^1169zYbc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Cytokine antagonists are monoclonal antibodies that offer new treatment options for refractory asthma but will also increase complexity because they are effective only for patients with certain asthma subtypes that remain to be more clearly defined. The clinical and inflammatory heterogeneity within refractory asthma makes it difficult to manage the disease and to determine which, if any, biologic therapy is suitable for a specific patient. The purpose of this article is to provide a data-driven discussion to clarify the use of biologic therapies in patients with refractory asthma. We first discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of refractory asthma. We then interpret current evidence for biomarkers of eosinophilic or type 2-high asthma so that clinicians can determine potential treatments for patients based on knowledge of their effectiveness in specific asthma phenotypes. We then assess clinical data on the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of approved and pipeline biologic therapies. We conclude by discussing the potential of phenotyping or endotyping refractory asthma and how biologic therapies can play a role in treating patients with refractory asthma.

### Targeting asthma remission as the next therapeutic step toward improving disease control [^114R57WP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, comprising the assessment of 2 main domains: (1) symptom control and (2) future risk of adverse outcomes. Decades of progress in asthma management have correlated with increasingly ambitious disease control targets. Moreover, the introduction of precision medicines, such as biologics, has further expanded the limits of what can be achieved in terms of disease control. It is now believed that clinical remission, a term rarely associated with asthma, may be an achievable treatment goal. An expert framework published in 2020 took the first step toward developing a commonly accepted definition of clinical remission in asthma. However, there remains a widespread discussion about the clinical parameters and thresholds that should be included in a standardized definition of clinical remission. This review aims to discuss on-treatment clinical remission as an aspirational outcome in asthma management, drawing on experiences from other chronic diseases where remission has long been a goal. We also highlight the integral role of shared decision-making between patients and health care professionals and the need for a common understanding of the individual patient journey to remission as foundational elements in reducing disease burden and improving outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Role of biologics in asthma [^115YSPCv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma have disproportionally high morbidity and healthcare utilization as compared with their peers with well-controlled disease. Although treatment options for these patients were previously limited, with unacceptable side effects, the emergence of biologic therapies for the treatment of asthma has provided promising targeted therapy for these patients. Biologic therapies target specific inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in patients with an endotype driven by type 2 (T2) inflammation. In addition to anti-IgE therapy that has improved outcomes in allergic asthma for more than a decade, three anti-IL-5 biologics and one anti-IL-4R biologic have recently emerged as promising treatments for T2 asthma. These targeted therapies have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce oral corticosteroid use, and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients. In addition to the currently approved biologic agents, several biologics targeting upstream inflammatory mediators are in clinical trials, with possible approval on the horizon. This article reviews the mechanism of action, indications, expected benefits, and side effects of each of the currently approved biologics for severe uncontrolled asthma and discusses promising therapeutic targets for the future.

### Factors to consider in prescribing asthma biologic therapies to children [^114o81fd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The increasing availability of biologics, both by expanding age indications and by development of new therapies, provides additional options to treat children and adolescents with severe asthma. However, the evidence for these biologics in these populations is limited compared with that for adult studies. As such, before initiation of therapy, possible alternative therapies that can also provide asthma control, confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma, management of comorbidities, and assessment of adherence should be explored. The choice of a biologic should be a shared decision-making process between providers and families, balancing biologic efficacy, goals of care, administration, and ability to treat multiple conditions. Response to treatment should be periodically evaluated not only to ensure an ineffective treatment is not continued but also to consider when to potentially discontinue therapy should it be beneficial. The utilization of biologics in children and adolescents with severe asthma also leads to unanswered questions on their role in disease remission and long-term outcomes.

### An update on monoclonal antibody therapy to treat moderate-to-severe asthma: benefits, choices, and limitations [^112x4jSF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Moderate or severe asthma is a complex disease process clinically manifesting as at least partially reversible airway obstruction due to airway hyperresponsiveness. Asthma therapy was based primarily on symptom control until recent studies of its mechanisms have led to a host of new targeted, safe, and effective therapies. These biologic therapies directly attack culprit inflammatory mediators at the molecular level. In this article we review currently available biologic agents for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma. We provide information deemed necessary to optimally consult with an asthma specialist to choose, assist in financial arrangements for, and coordinate the use of these new, promising, Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic agents. We will also briefly review the molecular pathways targeted with each class of biologic to provide a more in-depth understanding of why these targeted therapies are effective. These biologics are the first of many to come that modify newly discovered components of the immune system with which many physicians are unfamiliar.

### Real-world studies of biologics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma [^111GVrBu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Presently, there are 6 biologic agents available for treatment of asthma. Each of these agents has undergone robust clinical trials in their approval programs. Such studies rely upon very rigid entry criteria that may not translate to real-world efficacy. Thus, exploring the efficacy of these agents in a larger, more heterogeneous, population brings a sense of comfort regarding their efficacy in the real-world. This review explores the available literature regarding the use of biologics in the real world, with a focus on markers of likely response to therapy.

### Decoding treatment efficacy: uncovering response and failure dynamics to biologics in asthma [^115nsm34]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a global health problem, with alarming prevalence and mortality rates. Biologic therapies, particularly monoclonal antibodies such as omalizumab, have emerged as promising alternatives, targeting specific immune pathways. This article assesses the efficacy of these biologics in asthma management and attempts to reveal factors associated with their response and failure dynamics.

Area Covered

This article explores the efficacy of biologics in asthma, biomarkers, and the relationship between asthma phenotypes (including eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic (neutrophilic) types) and biologic treatments; particularly their effectiveness for each subtype.

Expert Opinion

Personalized asthma management that incorporates molecular insights as well as individual variations is of outmost necessity. An emphasis is put on immunological profiling, understanding comorbidities and considering individual patient factors when managing asthma. Cutting-edge phenotyping tools including omic technologies play a crucial role in improving asthma management precision. Variability in patient responses to biologic treatments such as non-responders, partial responders and super responders poses a formidable challenge to effective asthma care management strategies.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: a Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^113ihZfT]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering anti-IL-5 therapies in ≥ 18 years old patients with severe eosinophilic corticosteroid-dependent asthma, in an attempt to decrease or withdraw oral corticosteroids.

### Biologics in asthma: emerging biologics [^114Z45Q6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Advances in our understanding of asthma pathophysiology have led to the advent of multiple targeted asthma therapies such as biologics. However, partial response to biologics occurs, indicating residual disease activity in some patients. Hence, there exists a need for new therapies that focus on novel pathways, alongside perhaps evaluation of combination biologic therapies and modulators of downstream cytokine activation. Therefore, although our current focus is on biologics; it is critical to take a more holistic approach including consideration for nonbiologic therapies that have the potential to significantly advance asthma care.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-recommendations for severe asthma [^116pkF4Q]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of severe asthma, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include selection of a certain biological (as they all target overlapping disease phenotypes), the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based) and its cost-effectiveness. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of biologicals in severe asthma follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each biological and each outcome. In addition, a management algorithm for the use of biologicals in the clinic is proposed, together with future approaches and research priorities.

### Effective management of severe asthma with biologic medications in adult patients: a literature review and international expert opinion [^115ab5gn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma often remains uncontrolled despite effective treatments and evidence-based guidelines. A group of global experts in asthma and biologic medications from 9 countries considered the most relevant clinical variables to manage severe asthma in adult patients and guide treatment choice. The resulting recommendations address the investigation of biomarker levels (blood eosinophil count along with fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]), clinical features (oral corticosteroid [OCS] dependence, specific comorbid disease entities associated with severe type 2 asthma), and safety considerations. Current evidence suggests that biomarkers, including both blood or sputum eosinophil counts as well as FeNO, add prognostic and predictive value and should be measured in all patients with severe asthma. OCS use is an important factor in biologic selection, especially given the documented ability of some biologics to reduce OCS dependence. Comorbid diseases and relevant safety considerations to each biologic should also be considered. More data are needed to determine whether biomarker profiles identify patients suited to one biologic versus another as limited data support differential predictors of response. Further prospective head-to-head trials and post hoc analyses of clinical trial data are warranted. The authors believe that these recommendations have value as they offer expert opinion to assist health care providers in making difficult decisions regarding the quality of care in severe, type 2 asthma with biologic medications. They remain conditional and are based on limited data owing to a lack of head-to-head comparisons.

### Controversies in allergy: are biologic treatment responses in severe asthma the same in adults and children? [^113ygdQC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The availability of biologic agents for patients with severe asthma has increased dramatically over the last several decades. The absence of direct head-to-head comparative data and relative lack of biomarkers to predict response can make it difficult to choose the right biologic medication for a given patient. Selecting a biologic agent for the pediatric population presents further challenges due to more limited approved biologic agents and fewer clinical trials in children. In addition, the outcome data that are currently available suggest that treatment responses for a given biologic may be different between adult and pediatric patients. To better understand this possible difference in treatment response, this review focuses on the available efficacy data for biologics evaluated in adult and pediatric patients with severe asthma in addition to other considerations when choosing a biologic agent. Finally, this review discusses how asthma phenotypes differ across age groups and their contributions to the responses to biologic treatment across age groups.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114JybtT]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma biologic treatments — current consensus advice is that, generally, for a patient with a good response, a trial of withdrawal of the biologic should not be considered until after at least 12 months of treatment, and only if asthma remains well controlled on medium-dose ICS-containing therapy, and (for allergic asthma) there is no further exposure to a previous well-documented allergic trigger. There are few studies of cessation of biologic therapy; in these studies, symptom control worsened and/or exacerbations recurred in many (but not all) patients after cessation of the biologic. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, significantly more patients who stopped mepolizumab experienced a severe exacerbation within 12 months compared with those who continued treatment, with a small increase in ACQ-5 but no significant difference in symptom control between groups. In adults, long-term safety over 5 or more years of treatment has been reported for several biologics, with shorter follow-up to date for others.

### The evolving algorithm of biological selection in severe asthma [^115Mgwvm]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

New therapeutic options for severe asthma have recently emerged, mostly in the form of monoclonal antibodies ("biologicals") targeting relevant inflammatory pathways. Currently available agents target different aspects of "Type 2" immunity, and their indications often include overlapping patient groups. We present a round-table discussion that took place during the Annual Meeting of the Respiratory Effectiveness Group (REG), on the reasoning behind the use of different add-on medications for severe asthma, and crucially, on selection strategies. The proposed rational is based on current evidence, including real-life studies, as well as on the appreciation of the relevant complexities. Direct head-to-head comparisons of biologicals are lacking; therefore, algorithms for initial choice and potential switch between agents should be based on understanding the key characteristics of different options and the development of a clear plan with predefined targets and shared decision-making, in a structured way.

### Step 4: stick or twist? A review of asthma therapy [^117MFrg3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The evidence for pharmacological therapy at step 4 of the 2014 BTS/SIGN asthma management strategy is limited and current use of asthma therapy at this stage in the clinic relies heavily upon small clinical trials, broad licence indications, extrapolation from mild and moderate disease and observational evidence. Clinical trials are required to inform which of these treatments to try first and whether or not there are asthma phenotypes associated with specific treatment responses. The new era of biologics is likely to change how we view asthma severity and the step-up/step-down paradigm outlined in the 2014 version of the BTS/SIGN guidance may become less relevant, with stratified and personalised medicine becoming more important in the management of step 4–5 asthma.

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^116Q5po1]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and of improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma. We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogenous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology, and therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches that use previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### The relationship of asthma biologics to remission for asthma [^113LVvZ8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma treatments have evolved from bronchodilators to interventions directed toward the regulation of airway inflammation. From these advances has come greater disease control and reduced morbidity. The addition of biologics directed toward specific pathways of inflammation has advanced the efficacy of asthma control. With these treatment advances, a renewed interest in achieving a remission in asthma has arisen. Although asthma remission has been considered to reflect a "cure", new evaluations of this concept have proposed criteria for remission while on treatment. These criteria reflect a high level of disease control including absence of symptoms, optimization and stabilization of lung function, and absence of the use of systemic corticosteroids and have been proposed to indicate a remission of disease activity. Given the added efficacy found with biologics in asthma treatment for patients with moderate to severe disease, the question has arisen as to whether the use of biologics meets criteria for remission and may this change a component of underlying disease and risks. Biologics are highly effective in reducing exacerbations, diminishing symptoms, and improving lung function in well-defined asthma populations. At present, however, biologics achieve some, but in most cases not all criteria for a remission on treatment. However, the concept of promoting treatment efforts to achieve disease remission in asthma is important, potentially achievable, and merits consideration for future guideline-directed care approaches.

Public input and biologic agents as an emerging topic — The Expert Panel received and reviewed approximately 500 comments from almost 100 individuals and organizations, and commenters mentioned almost all of the emerging topics; of the 11 emerging topics, biologic agents received the most attention. The first biologic agent for asthma received approval from the US FDA in 2003, but the second biologic agent did not receive approval until November 2015, and between November 2015 and November 2017, four biologic agents received approval; at the time that the priority topics and key questions were developed, the only biologic agent available for use in the United States was omalizumab, which EPR-3 had addressed.

### Immunomodulatory and biologic therapies for severe refractory asthma [^113m8XzC]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Despite undoubted efficacy of the combination of inhaled corticosteroids and beta(2)-agonists for most asthmatic patients with moderate-to-severe disease, there remains approximately 10% of the asthmatic population with serious unremitting symptoms, resulting in considerable impact on quality of life, disproportionate use of health care resources, and adverse effects from regular systemic steroid use. In an ideal world, optimal treatment of severe refractory asthma should achieve the best possible asthma control and quality of life with the least dose of systemic corticosteroids. The choice and formulation of therapeutic agent are dictated by the severity of disease and may include immunological modifiers and biologic therapies. Unfortunately, current asthma guidelines offer little contribution to the management of the challenging patient with severe refractory asthma and none of them have addressed therapeutic alternatives to oral corticosteroids. This article reviews the current evidence for immunomodulating and biologic approaches in severe refractory asthma.

### Recent evidence for stepping down severe asthma therapies [^116psxWo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Biologics have proven safe and effective for severe asthma. Their introduction has offered hope for patients and prescribers with a growing list of novel medications and indications. While 'step-up' indications for biologic initiation are well described in guidelines, 'step-down' strategy remains poorly understood and thus guidance is limited. In this opinion article we aim to focus on recent practice changing evidence for stepping-down severe asthma management, tools for the assessment of biologic efficacy, propose a framework for the step-down of biologic and nonbiologic therapies and suggest topics of interest for future research.

Recent Findings

Clinical tools have been developed to aid in assessing biologic response. Some patients experience marked improvement and may enter a period of clinical remission or even complete remission. Following positive response, add-on therapy may safely be approached for taper or withdrawal.

Summary

There is limited consensus but growing evidence for stepping-down therapies in patients who achieve clinical response and/or remission after biologic initiation. Further structured guidance would benefit clinicians who face clinical uncertainty when deciding to step-down therapy in patients with well controlled asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1155yLmJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The working group that identified the six priority topics for this update based its recommendations on information available at that time. This information did not include the subsequent explosion of research and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of multiple drugs classified as asthma biologics. Any attempt to include biologic agents in this report at the start of this effort would have delayed the release of these recommendations for another 1 to 2 years, and this was felt to be unacceptable. This update also is not a complete revision of EPR-3. Important aspects of care, such as asthma education (including inhaler technique) and assessment tools for asthma control, adherence, and other factors, are not covered. Reasons for these limitations included lack of time, lack of resources, and, for some topics, insufficient new evidence.

Finally, several new features in this update were designed to aid providers and clinicians in addressing these topics with their patients. The biggest of these changes is the addition of an Implementation Guidance section for each recommendation. Each Implementation Guidance section begins with a clinician summary — an expanded statement of the recommendation to quickly assist clinicians in better understanding the recommendation from a user's perspective. The Implementation Guidance section also provides further clarification of the population to which the recommendation applies, exceptions, and practical aspects of how to use the recommendation in patient care. At the end of each Implementation Guidance section is a list of issues suggested by the Expert Panel to communicate to patients as part of shared decision making about whether to use the therapy or intervention mentioned in the recommendation. Amended step diagrams for asthma management are also provided for the topics being updated. Many of the updated interventions in these diagrams are now preferred first-line treatments.

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^113yCoau]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that availability of biologics for severe asthma is limited to high‐income countries at present, with omalizumab being the most accessible monoclonal antibody, worldwide. The high cost of these biologics remains the main constraint. Even in high‐income countries where healthcare is accessed by insurance, its availability is not universal. It should also be noted that the nature of asthma, including the prevalence of non‐eosinophilic asthma, varies across the world. Undoubtedly a small number of LMIC asthmatics will benefit from biologicals. Omalizumab is coming off patent in November 2025, and there is a large market developing biosimilars. This is likely to become much more accessible worldwide, and given it is still effective in approximately half‐two‐thirds of children, this will be a step forward in LMIC. However, it is crucial that the basic work‐up and management of severe asthma is first addressed. Also important is making the WHO list of essential asthma medications universally available, as targeting public heath interventions to improve disease awareness and address modifiable risk factors in low‐ and middle‐income countries, to to have the greatest impact in improving disease burden.

### Clinical issues in severe asthma: debates and discussions about personalizing patient management [^1144M7VS]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

An outsized proportion of asthma-related morbidity and mortality is borne by the 5% to 15% of affected patients who have severe forms of the disease. These patients experience poorly controlled symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite daily treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and other long-acting controller medications. Ongoing research has elucidated key pathophysiologic processes and other clinical parameters related to asthma severity and persistence. In many cases, the patient's medical history, clinical presentation, and results from biomarker testing can help classify severe asthma phenotypically. Increasingly, this approach can allow health-care providers to personalize maintenance regimens using targeted therapies for the identified endotypes; that is, asthma phenotypes linked to specific underlying disease mechanisms and proinflammatory signaling cascades. Several biologic medications are now available to treat certain cohorts with severe asthma, and a number of other targeted agents are in late-stage development. Pulmonologists and asthma specialists who manage patients with severe asthma need to stay current on the latest published trial data for newer targeted therapies, approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration, and actionable best-practice recommendations on evaluating and treating patients with severe asthma. During this web-based Clinical Issues program (available online at https://courses.elseviercme.com/asthma18/761e), a panel of expert faculty discuss a series of topics related to the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of severe asthma, including the following: characterizing severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes; identification of patients with severe asthma; and the role of biomarkers in asthma phenotyping. The faculty also highlight the identification and management of comorbid conditions commonly associated with asthma. An overview of new and emerging biologic therapies for severe asthma is provided, followed by a detailed discussion on personalizing treatment for patients with severe asthma.

### New and emerging drug treatments for severe asthma [^113Hg6uf]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the airways affecting over 300 million people world-wide. In 5%-10% of cases, it is severe, with disproportionate healthcare resource utilization including costs associated with frequent exacerbations and the long-term health effects of systemic steroids. Characterization of inflammatory pathways in severe asthma has led to the development of targeted biological and small molecule therapies which aim to achieve disease control while minimizing corticosteroid-associated morbidity. Herein, we review currently licensed agents and those in development, and speculate how drug therapy for severe asthma might evolve and impact on clinical outcomes in the near future.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111eYqKT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

This recommendation is specific to using Flevels when selecting therapy for individuals with asthma and when monitoring the response to and adjusting the dosage of anti-inflammatory therapies. This recommendation does not apply to individuals taking biologic agents, with the exception of omalizumab, because the systematic review literature searches conducted until October 2018 did not include data on biologic agents other than omalizumab. Clinicians must interpret Flevels in conjunction with other clinical data because these levels are affected by comorbid conditions, including allergic rhinitis and atopy. The weight of the evidence suggests that when used as part of an asthma management strategy, Fmonitoring is effective in preventing exacerbations only when used frequently (such as every 2–3 months), but even frequent monitoring does not improve asthma control or quality of life in individuals with asthma.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^112Us43S]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### Biologic therapies for asthma [^114Y2zrp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The use of immunomodulators in asthma has been well established with omalizumab. Evidence is accumulating for other biologic agents. The following article presents an overview of current biologic therapies employed and under investigation in the treatment of asthma.

Recent Findings

Anti-immunoglobulin E and anti-interleukin-5 are best supported by current evidence. However, new data are also available with other therapies, including cytokine inhibitors, oligonucleotides and CpG vaccines.

Summary

Biologic therapies currently represent useful adjunctive treatments for asthma, especially in patients with more severe disease that is not responsive to conventional therapies alone. However, the varied responses now found suggest that specific phenotypes may need to be identified to see optimal effects from specific treatments. Further studies are required to access the efficacy and side effect profiles of these therapies.

### Precision medicine in asthma: linking phenotypes to targeted treatments [^117QU3QG]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease consisting of different phenotypes that are driven by different mechanistic pathways. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the important role of precision medicine in asthma management.

Recent Findings

Despite asthma heterogeneity, the approach to management has been on the basis of disease severity, with the most severe patients reserved for the maximum treatments with corticosteroids and bronchodilators. At the severe end, the recent availability of biologic therapies in the form of anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL5 therapies (mepolizumab and reslizumab) has driven the adaptation of precision medicine. These therapies are reserved for severe asthma with defined either allergic or eosinophilic background, respectively.

Summary

Unbiased definition of phenotypes or endotypes (which are phenotypes defined by mechanisms) is an important step towards the use of precision medicine in asthma. Although T2-high asthma has been defined with targets becoming available for treating allergic or eosinophilic asthma, the definition of non-T2 phenotypes remains a priority. Precision medicine is also dependent on the definition of biomarkers that can help differentiate between these phenotypes and pinpoint patients suitable for specific-targeted therapies. Thus, precision medicine links phenotypes (endotypes) to targeted treatments for better outcomes.

### Asthma phenotypes as a guide for current and future biologic therapies [^115wr1Aa]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma has been increasingly recognized as being a heterogeneous disease with multiple distinct mechanisms and pathophysiologies. Evidence continues to build regarding the existence of different cell types, environmental exposures, pathogens, and other factors that produce a similar set of symptoms known collectively as asthma. This has led to a movement from a "one size fits all" symptom-based methodology to a more patient-centered, individualized approach to asthma treatment targeting the underlying disease process. A significant contributor to this shift to more personalized asthma therapy has been the increasing availability of numerous biologic therapies in recent years, providing the opportunity for more targeted treatments. When targeted biologics began to be developed for treatment of asthma, the hope was that distinct biomarkers would become available, allowing the clinician to determine which biologic therapy was best suited for which patients. Presence of certain biomarkers, like eosinophilia or antigen-specific IgE, is important features of specific asthma phenotypes. Currently available biomarkers can help with decision making about biologics, but are generally too broad and non-specific to clearly identify an asthma phenotype or the single biologic best suited to an asthmatic. Identification of further biomarkers is the subject of intense research. Yet, identifying a patient's asthma phenotype can help in predicting disease course, response to treatment, and biologic therapies to consider. In this review, major asthma phenotypes are reviewed, and the evidence for the utility of various biologics, both those currently on the market and those in the development process, in each of these phenotypes is explored.

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^112vLMzf]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma affects one in 11 children in the UK, one of the highest prevalences of this condition in Europe. This disease burden has not significantly changed over the last two decades, and the UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes (including childhood asthma deaths) in Europe. Asthma was classically thought to be variable airflow flow obstruction, caused by inflammation and bronchial hyper‐responsiveness. However, more evidence is emerging that asthma is a heterogeneous condition. Management of severe asthma is challenging, particularly since the evidence base for treatment is largely extrapolated from teenagers and adults with severe asthma, which is recognized to have a different pathophysiology to school aged asthma. Evidence has also emerged that children with mild or moderate asthma may have different pathophysiology to those with severe asthma. It is estimated that around 2%–5% of children with school aged asthma have problematic severe asthma (PSA), with poor symptom control despite being prescribed maximum asthma therapy. It is crucial to recognize that children with PSA account for half of healthcare costs for childhood asthma and are at high risk of asthma related deaths, and therefore all children with severe asthma must be referred to a severe asthma specialist center.

### Biologics in asthma: potential to achieve clinical remission [^11373CfY]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Establishing a universal definition for asthma remission has the potential to improve asthma outcomes and advance research. However, there is still no consensus definition despite broad multidisciplinary efforts to achieve this goal. This study explores the evolving concept of asthma remission, emphasizing the potential of biologics to achieve this state. We will discuss various proposed definitions of asthma remission, international guidelines, and studies evaluating the effectiveness of biologics at achieving clinical remission. We highlight the need for a consensus definition of asthma remission to standardize treatment goals and improve patient outcomes.

### Biologics for the treatments of allergic conditions: severe asthma [^112i9tNF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

By selectively targeting specific steps of the immune inflammation cascade, biologic drugs for severe asthma have substantially contributed to increase the standard of care, to reduce drug-related morbidity. and most importantly to ameliorate patients' quality of life. Upcoming molecules are going to provide a chance for severe phenotypes besides Th2 high through the interaction with epithelial and innate immunity. Some practical aspects including optimal treatment duration, the possibility of a dose treatment modulation, the place and relevance of ICS in best responders are still under debate. Long-term safety, especially when interacting with innate immunity needs to be further investigated.

### Biologic immune modifiers: trials and tribulations – are we there yet? [^1164HwMd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Biologic agents as therapeutic modalities have emerged as an important new drug treatment. This article focuses on specific groups of immune response modulators of mAbs and recombinant proteins, and their use or their potential use in asthma as an example of an inflammatory allergic process. Although some of these new biologic agents are currently used only in animal models of allergic disease or in other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, this field is advancing so rapidly that in a few years, these new treatment modalities could be applied to allergic diseases. This article provides a brief rationale for the use of these new biologic agents in asthma. Although optimism is very high for this new class of drugs, caution is needed in extrapolating in vitro data or studies from animal models; adverse events will happen. Nevertheless, as we learn how to modify and alter the inflammatory and immune processes with these new biologic agents, clinicians will enter a new era of treatment options available for their patients with allergic disorders.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bRNCH]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission on treatment — In patients with severe asthma receiving biological therapy and medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), remission rates will vary by baseline population characteristics and by how remission is defined and assessed; baseline predictors of remission on treatment include better short-term asthma symptom control scores (ACT or ACQ), better lung function, fewer comorbidities, earlier asthma onset, and no or lower maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS), while in adult-onset asthma studied off treatment the only baseline predictors of clinical persistence were moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness and nasal polyps; although most data are from adults with severe asthma treated with biologics, the concept is relevant to patients with asthma of any severity and any treatment (including ICS-containing therapy, oral pharmacotherapies, allergen immunotherapy and non‑pharmacological interventions), and when discussing 'remission' with patients the medical meaning for asthma should be explained and patients should not stop taking any of their asthma medications except on medical advice; research needs include linking clinical criteria with biomarkers/imaging/pathology and investigating predictors of long-term remission or recurrence, and clinical and qualitative research is needed to know whether aiming for remission improves long-term outcomes.

Adjunct therapies and scope notes for ages 12+ years — immunotherapy and biologics: "Steps 2–4: Conditionally recommend the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy as an adjunct treatment to standard pharmacotherapy in individuals ≥ 5 years of age whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy". The figure notes to "Consider adding Asthma Biologics (e.g., anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL5R, anti-IL4/IL13)", but also states, "The AHRQ systematic reviews that informed this report did not include studies that examined the role of asthma biologics (e.g., anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL5R, anti-IL4/IL13). Thus, this report does not contain specific recommendations for the use of biologics in asthma in Steps 5 and 6". For LAMA at the highest step, "Data on the use of LAMA therapy in individuals with severe persistent asthma (Step 6) were not included in the AHRQ systematic review and thus no recommendation is made". Medication considerations include: "Cromolyn, Nedocromil, LTRAs including Zileuton and montelukast, and Theophylline were not considered for this update, and/or have limited availability for use in the United States and/or have an increased risk of adverse consequences and need for monitoring that make their use less desirable. The FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020".

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer the following add-on biologic therapy options in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma despite optimized maximal therapy:

- anti-IgE treatment (omalizumab) in patients aged ≥ 6 years with severe allergic asthma

- anti-IL-5/5 receptor treatment (mepolizumab SC in patients aged ≥ 6 years, benralizumab SC in patients aged ≥ 12 years, or reslizumab IV in patients aged ≥ 18 years) in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma

- anti-IL-4Ra treatment (dupilumab SC) in patients aged ≥ 6 years with severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma or in adult or adolescent patients requiring treatment with maintenance corticosteroids

- anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin treatment (tezepelumab SC) in patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe asthma.

### Exploring definitions and predictors of severe asthma clinical remission after biologic treatment in adults [^1114LnqG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings have tested the sensitivity of asthma remission definitions in the largest severe asthma cohort in the world, shown how the proportion of patients categorized as in remission is affected by some domains more than others, and, by identifying a wide range of prebiologic factors associated with remission, brought us one step closer to accurate remission prediction in real life. Although remission is the ultimate goal of asthma management, it occurs in a relatively small proportion of patients treated with current biologics. This may suggest the need to consider switching biologic therapies if remission is not achieved, use of biologic combinations, and use of biologics earlier to give patients the best chance of achieving remission, but further research is needed. If remission is the target, guidelines should reflect that, and treatment approaches/strategies in selected patients most likely to achieve it may be recommended (pending confirmation).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113EvJVp]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-down and sequencing with biologic therapy and oral corticosteroids (OCS) — once good symptom control has been maintained for 2–3 months, and if the patient has not had any exacerbations, asthma treatment can be carefully down-titrated to the minimum medications and dose that will maintain good symptom control and minimize exacerbation risk, while reducing the potential for side-effects. For patients with severe asthma who have had a good asthma response to biologic therapy, a longer period of stability is recommended before the ICS dose is reduced, and reduction and cessation of OCS should be undertaken first; patients who are being considered for a high daily dose of ICS (except for short periods) should be referred for expert assessment and advice, where possible.

### Long-term safety, durability of response, cessation and switching of biologics [^114LYmkh]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe asthma patients suffer from decreased quality of life, and increased asthma symptoms, exacerbations, hospitalizations, and risk of death. Biologics have revolutionized treatment for severe asthma. However, with multiple biologic agents now available, clinicians must consider initial selection the long-term effectiveness of biologics. Additionally, patients have overlapping eligibilities and clinicians may consider switching between biologics for improved response. Finally, careful assessment of biologics cessation is needed for severe asthma patients who depend on these add-on therapies for asthma control.

Recent Findings

Evidence for long-term durability and safety varies by biologic agent. In general, initial benefits noted from these agents (ex. exacerbation reduction) is, at minimum, sustained with long term use. Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events, including those requiring cessation of a biologics are low with long term use. Further studies are needed to understand the development of antidrug antibodies but currently their prevalence rates are low. Adverse events and insufficient efficacy are common reasons for biologic cessation or switching. Discontinuation maybe associated with waning of benefits but can be considered in certain situations. Biologic switching can be associated with improved asthma control.

Summary

Biologics are safe and effective long-term therapies for the management of asthma. Discontinuation must be carefully considered and if possible avoided. Reasons for insufficient efficacy must be evaluated and if needed, biologic switching should be considered.

### Novel asthma treatments: advancing beyond approved novel step-up therapies for asthma [^115kZmxv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, the management of severe asthma has shifted from relying on inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to more precise, targeted approaches. Monoclonal antibodies designed to address specific molecular pathways in asthma have transformed care for patients with severe asthma. Because therapy targeting IgE became the first biologic developed for allergic asthma in 2003, monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin (IL)-5, IL-5 receptor, IL-4/-13 receptor, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin have been approved for treating difficult-to-treat asthma, improving symptoms, reducing exacerbations, and reducing oral corticosteroid dosing. Despite these advances, many patients continue to experience asthma exacerbations and symptoms and fail to achieve remission. To address this, pharmaceutical companies and researchers are exploring novel therapies targeting different aspects of asthma pathophysiology, including cytokines, enzymes, and cellular pathways. Innovative treatments such as inhaled biologics, ultra-long-acting biologics, and combination biologics are in development. New molecular targets, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase, OX-40 ligand, and Janus kinase, offer promise for addressing unmet needs in asthma care. Although many therapies have failed to get approval for use because of a lack of efficacy, trial design, or toxicity, these experiments still provide insights into asthma's underlying mechanisms. The future of asthma management looks promising, with emerging therapies aiming to improve patient outcomes. The challenge will lie in identifying the right therapy for each patient and developing personalized treatment strategies.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^116kVhmb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future direction

Despite the advent of targeted biologics and OCS drawbacks and disadvantages, corticosteroids continue to be used in asthma management. The goal is to find ways to greatly reduce or eliminate their long‐term use and to better balance the safety and effectiveness of asthma treatments.

There are gaps in knowledge and practice related to OCS stewardship. Systemic corticosteroids are the option of last resort in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 treatment, and GINA recommends gradual decrease and/or discontinuation of OCS after patients achieve a good response to biologic therapies. Ideally, the role of OCS will continue to narrow as the use of novel therapies targeting specific pathways increases.

In order to prevent both the systemic effects and the development of AI associated with long‐term OCS use, steroid‐sparing strategies are needed to advance safety amongst patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Treatments that directly target airway inflammation offer improved overall control of asthma and reduce OCS use. Biologic therapies greatly decrease the role of OCS and, in many cases, eliminate their need entirely.

Education is key to elevating awareness of optimal asthma control for patients, as well as steroid‐sparing strategies amongst clinicians. Ongoing clinical trials are already changing clinical practice by guiding the tapering of OCS and the screening and management of AI after introducing biologics. Importantly, substantial and long‐lasting modifications in prescribing patterns of OCS may well require changes to healthcare systems and collaborations amongst different specialties.

### Biological therapies for eosinophilic asthma [^117WYuDD]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe uncontrolled asthma is by definition refractory to traditional therapies or can be controlled only with therapies that have intolerable side effects. Monoclonal antibodies that target interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5Rα, IgE, and IL-4Rα have shown favorable results in clinical trials, including reductions in asthma exacerbations and other important clinical outcomes. These biological agents offer treatment alternatives to patients with uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma.

Areas Covered

This article reviews how the shifting emphasis toward identifying distinct asthma phenotypes has led to the approval of biological therapies that preferentially benefit patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The clinical trials that led to the approval of these biologic treatments are discussed in detail.

Expert Opinion

Biologic therapies targeting the IL-5, IgE, IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways have been successful in clinical trials in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Some of these agents have also been successful regardless of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. These treatments have shown a relatively favorable safety profile in clinical trials, although long-term safety data for some of these agents are limited. Due to the high costs associated with these medications, they should be reserved for select patients where they yield a therapeutic and pharmacoeconomic advantage.

### Do comorbidities influence the response to biologics in severe asthma? [^1173c3aU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to this breakthrough study in that biologic treatments were dominated by anti–IL-5/IL-5R agents. It will be interesting and important that similar future observations include anti–IL-4/IL-13 receptor and anti–thymic stromal lymphopoietin biologics. Nonetheless, Wechsler and colleagues provide new insights into the responsiveness to biologic treatments in severe asthma and the important influence of selected comorbidities. An ongoing therapeutic dilemma has been a more informed identification of patients most likely to respond to a biologic; information to narrow this gap now includes selected comorbidities. However, the equivalence regarding this treatment-enhancing effect is not found with all comorbid entities. In particular, the occurrence of better clinical and functional improvements in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma and comorbidities such as CRS ± NP or NP, for example, implies the necessity of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary management of these complex patients. Our quest to be more precise and predictable in identifying the right patient for the right biologic has been significantly advanced by this innovative study.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114u1h56]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 8–3 — assess and treat severe asthma phenotypes presents a Type 2 airway inflammation pathway in which Type 2 inflammation is indicated by blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb and/or sputum eosinophils ≥ 2%, and/or asthma is clinically allergen-driven, with a note to repeat blood eosinophils and FeNO up to 3x, at least 1–2 weeks after OCS or at lowest possible OCS dose. For patients with evidence of Type 2 airway inflammation, consider adherence tests, consider increasing the ICS dose for 3–6 months, and consider add-on non-biologic treatment for specific Type 2 clinical phenotypes. The algorithm asks, Is add-on Type 2 biologic therapy available/affordable?, and advises, Check local eligibility criteria for specific biologic therapies as these may vary from those listed. If add-on Type 2 targeted biologic therapy is NOT available/affordable, consider higher dose ICS, if not used, consider other add-on therapy (e.g. LAMA, LTRA, low dose azithromycin), as last resort, consider add-on low dose OCS, but implement strategies to minimize side-effects, and stop ineffective add-on therapies.

### Biomarkers in severe asthma [^115AGHre]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been critical for studies of disease pathogenesis and the development of new therapies in severe asthma. In particular, biomarkers of type 2 inflammation have proven valuable for endotyping and targeting new biological agents. Because of these successes in understanding and marking type 2 inflammation, lack of knowledge regarding non-type 2 inflammatory mechanisms in asthma will soon be the major obstacle to the development of new treatments and management strategies in severe asthma. Biomarkers can play a role in these investigations as well by providing insight into the underlying biology in human studies of patients with severe asthma.

### Biologics in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents [^116xJyY6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma in childhood confers substantial patient- and society-level burdens. Although biologics have been available for the management in adults and adolescents for nearly 20 years, research on the efficacy and safety of biologics in children and adolescents has lagged. Fortunately, more recent research specifically in children has provided an evidence base for biologic use in this age group. Most children with severe asthma demonstrate a type 2 inflammatory phenotype, the primary target of currently approved biologics. Three biologics, omalizumab, mepolizumab, and duplilumab, are Food and Drug Administration-approved for children as young as 6 years, whereas benralizumab and tezepelumab are approved for adolescents older than 12 years. All these agents reduce the rates of severe asthma exacerbations, whereas their effects on pulmonary function vary across agents. Safety profiles are reassuring, although additional long-term safety data in children are still needed. The choice of a biologic agent follows a careful assessment of other factors that contribute to uncontrolled asthma and includes biomarkers of blood eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, allergic sensitization, and IgE levels. This review focuses on the underlying pathophysiology of childhood asthma, an approach to phenotyping patients, and the efficacy, safety, and use of biologics in children and adolescents with severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

Recognize that the following cutoffs have been used at initiation:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |

### Remission in children receiving biologic therapy for severe asthma [^113ZzUQr]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Biologic therapy has transformed the management of severe asthma, with benefits including reduced asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions, along with improved asthma control, quality of life, and lung function. Often, patients are also able to reduce background asthma therapy. The response to biologic therapy can be so profound that some patients are said to be in remission. While the definition of remission in asthma has been debated, consensus criteria have been published by the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and American Thoracic Society (herein referred to as consensus criteria). A recent analysis of the International Severe Asthma Registry (ISAR), which included data from 23 countries and 3717 participants, reported that 20.3% of people treated with biologics achieved remission. Of note, the definition of remission used in the ISAR study differed from the consensus criteria, with the ISAR definition being easier to achieve. Further, the ISAR study only included participants aged 18 years and older. Biologic therapy is approved down to 6 years of age; however, data regarding the rates of remission in children and adolescents are lacking.

### Asthma: pathogenesis and novel drugs for treatment [^115F8xVU]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Asthma affects almost 20 million people in the United States and more than 300 million people worldwide. Of these, 10–15% have severe asthma, which is refractory to commonly available drugs. New drugs are needed because those that are currently available cannot control symptoms and exacerbations in all patients and can cause adverse reactions. In the past 10 years, there have been substantial advances in the understanding of asthma genetics, airway biology, and immune cell signaling. These advances have led to the development of small molecule therapeutics and biologic agents that may improve asthma care in the future. Several new classes of asthma drugs — including ultra long acting β agonists and modulators of the interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 pathways — have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. Other new drug classes — including dissociated corticosteroids, CXC chemokine receptor 2 antagonists, toll-like receptor 9 agonists, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors — remain in earlier phases of development. Despite some preliminary efficacy data, there is insufficient evidence to make strong recommendations about the use of these newer agents. Future research on the clinical efficacy of these biologic agents, the effect of newer agents on severe asthma in pediatric patients, and the biology of non-eosinophilic and corticosteroid resistant asthma is needed to reduce the morbidity of asthma worldwide.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^116hJFhh]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Making the Decision for a Biologic

Assuming a satisfactory and unrevealing workup, four main therapeutic options could be considered at the first patient encounter. In increasing order of expected benefits for the patient, these are as follows.
1 No therapeutic change is implemented, but allergen avoidance is recommended, despite the low likelihood that that will decrease exacerbation frequency. Ordering more ancillary tests may be considered, despite having clearly identified the clinical problem.
2 Optimizing the pharmaceutical care of potentially related comorbidities (eg, acid reflux, sinus disease), without necessarily addressing the cause of asthma attacks.
3 Prescribing oral medications (eg, montelukast, sublingual immunotherapy, or theophylline) that are likely to be of very limited proven efficacy in severe asthma.
4 Initiating a monoclonal antibody for asthma. Although all of the options above may be considered, this is likely the best option, assuming an appropriate prescription based on biomarkers and comorbidities and that the patient meets regional prescription criteria, treatment is reimbursed, and the medications are available.

In considering biologic therapies in this patient and in all ensuing patients, we assume that the extrinsic factors noted in (4) otherwise have been addressed.

Choosing a Biologic

The first patient is typical insofar as she is eligible for all biologics available: the anti-IgE omalizumab, the anti-IL-5s mepolizumab and reslizumab, the anti-IL-5-receptor (IL-5R) benralizumab, the anti-IL-4-receptor dupilumab, and the anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) tezepelumab.

In the absence of direct head-to-head analyses, it is difficult to provide a strong evidence-based choice solely considering the characteristics of the asthma. As can be expected, indirect comparisons of different biologic treatments either by carefully matching key baseline characteristics or by performing network meta-analyses have not yet led to any firm conclusions. Perhaps the sole exception to this rule is when a treatment goal is to wean patients off maintenance systemic corticosteroids; mepolizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab have demonstrated oral corticosteroid (OCS)-sparing effects in controlled trials. However, this is not applicable to this patient's case. So, how does one choose?

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1178TNY9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Ages 5–11 years asthma stepwise management — preferred controller/reliever options escalate from daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), to daily and PRN combination low-dose ICS–formoterol, then daily and PRN combination medium-dose ICS–formoterol, followed by daily high-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) with PRN SABA, and finally daily high-dose ICS–LABA + oral systemic corticosteroid with PRN SABA. Assess control and actions include to first check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions; step up if needed and reassess in 2–6 weeks; step down if possible if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months; and consult with an asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required, considering consultation at Step 3. For adjuncts, Steps 2–4 conditionally recommend the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy in individuals ≥ 5 years of age whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy; consider Omalizumab, noting that Omalizumab is the only asthma biologic currently FDA-approved for this age range, and the FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020.

### Biologics in asthma: difficulties and drawbacks [^117SroHy]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Biologics have become an increasingly important class of therapeutic compounds in a variety of immune and/or inflammatory diseases. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma represent a significant unmet need.

Methods

This review gives some examples of the complex use of biologics in asthma.

Results/Conclusions

It is very difficult to predict the efficacy of biologics in severe asthma and only one monoclonal antibody to date has been found to be effective and approved by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of difficult allergic asthma. New pathways may prove to be of importance for the development of biologics. Biologics are not devoid of side effects, which can, although not always, be predicted from their mechanism of action. These include hypersensitivity reactions, which need to be better understood to prevent and control them. Finally, biologics should be cost-effective. This review gives some examples of the complex use of biologics in asthma.

### Asthma phenotypes and the use of biologic medications in asthma and allergic disease: the next steps toward personalized care [^117TAYuQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Traditionally, asthma and allergic diseases have been defined by broad definitions and treated with nonspecific medications, including corticosteroids and bronchodilators. There is an increasing appreciation of heterogeneity within asthma and allergic diseases based primarily on recent cluster analyses, molecular phenotyping, biomarkers, and differential responses to targeted and nontargeted therapies. These pioneering studies have led to successful therapeutic trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined phenotypes. This review analyzed randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined allergic disease and asthma phenotypes. IgE was the first successful biological target used in patients with allergic disease and asthma. This review shows that therapies targeting the canonical type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 have shown consistent efficacy, especially in asthmatic patients with evidence of TH2/type 2 inflammation ("type 2 high"). As of yet, there are no successful trials of targeted therapies in asthmatic patients without evidence for type 2 inflammation. We conclude that further refinement of type 2 therapies to specific type 2 phenotypes and novel approaches for patients without type 2 inflammation are needed for asthma and allergic disease treatment.

Childhood asthma remission — research needs note that clinical questions about remission off treatment in children focus on risk factors for asthma persistence and recurrence (including clinical, pathological, and genetic factors), the effect of risk reduction strategies on the likelihood of remission, whether monitoring after remission to allow early identification of asthma recurrence improves outcomes, and whether progression to persistent airflow limitation can be prevented. Clinical questions about remission on treatment (e.g., in children with severe asthma treated with biologic therapy) include whether inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy can be down-titrated.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11782icB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity terminology — variability across settings — explains that in the community and in primary care, 'severe' or 'mild' labels are commonly based on symptom or exacerbation frequency irrespective of treatment, whereas epidemiological studies and clinical trials often classify severity by prescribed treatment GINA or BTS Step regardless of asthma control. Most clinical trials of biologic therapy enroll patients uncontrolled despite taking medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA without routinely addressing contributory factors before enrolment. Some guidelines retain an older symptom-based classification distinguishing 'intermittent' and 'mild persistent' asthma with an untested assumption that patients with symptoms ≤ 2 days/week were not at risk and should be treated with SABA alone; however, patients with so-called 'intermittent' asthma can have severe or fatal exacerbations and their risk is substantially reduced by ICS-containing treatment compared with SABA alone. For low-resource countries, the World Health Organization definition of severe asthma includes 'untreated severe asthma', corresponding to uncontrolled asthma in patients not taking any ICS-containing treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115E5fQV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The six priority topics identified for systematic review were as follows:
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (F) in diagnosis, medication selection, and monitoring of treatment response in asthma
Remediation of indoor allergens (eg, house-dust mites/pets) in asthma management
Adjustable medication dosing in recurrent wheezing and asthma
Long-acting antimuscarinic agents in asthma management as add-ons to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs)
Immunotherapy and the management of asthma
Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) in adult severe asthma

The NHLBAC Asthma Expert Working Group recommended that another 11 topics be acknowledged in the update but that no recommendations be developed for these topics because of the lack of sufficient new data for a systematic review of these topics at that time. These emerging topics are as follows:
Adherence
Asthma action plans
Asthma heterogeneity
Biologic agents
Biomarkers (other than F)
Classification of asthma severity
Long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) safety
Physiological assessments
Prevention of asthma onset
Role of community health workers in asthma management
Step down from maintenance therapy

The AHRQ EPCs conducted systematic reviews of the six priority topics and published the findings from these reviews online between October 2017 and March 2018. – These systematic reviews provided the evidence used to update the priority topics for this report.

In 2015, the NAEPPCC, which is a federal advisory committee, was created to continue the work of the NAEPP. In 2018, after the systematic reviews on the priority topics were completed, the NAEPPCC established the "Expert Panel", which was charged with using the published systematic review reports to make recommendations on the key questions that could be implemented by health care providers and people with asthma.

The Expert Panel, composed of 18 members and a chair, included asthma content experts (pediatric and adult pulmonologists and allergists, an emergency room physician, and a pharmacist), primary care clinicians (pediatric, internal medicine, and family medicine providers), health policy experts, and implementation and dissemination experts. The Expert Panel received support from individuals who had experience using the GRADE approach.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement — future research opportunities in asthma include clarifying its role in the diagnostic process, including which individuals with asthma aged 5 years and older should be tested; using FeNO testing to monitor adherence of children and adults to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and other anti-inflammatory treatments; evaluating FeNO in children aged 0 to 5 years with wheezing or asthma-like symptoms to predict subsequent asthma diagnoses; assessing point-of-care FeNO to identify children who do not require oral corticosteroid therapy; FeNO-based asthma management in people with moderate to severe persistent asthma; potential uses for asthma management in primary care; impact of health disparities due to lack of health care coverage and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations and clinical settings; the role of FeNO testing in uncontrolled asthma to predict benefit of adding T2-directed biologic therapies; refinement and validation of FeNO cutoff levels for diagnostic purposes across determinants and groups; identification of algorithms combining objective measures (including FeNO levels, blood eosinophil levels, spirometry test results, short-acting beta2-agonist [SABA] use, and symptom scores) for choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapy; and identifying populations most likely to benefit from FeNO-guided treatment and the optimal frequency of FeNO monitoring.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — interim advice on severity descriptors for clinical practice and education: The document states that GINA "continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled". It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Switching between biologics in severe asthma patients. when the first choice is not proven to be the best [^111whaXK]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

During the last decades, new treatments targeting disease mechanisms referred as biologics have been introduced in the therapy of asthma and currently, five monoclonal antibodies have been approved. Although these therapeutic agents have been formulated to target specific asthma endotypes, it is often difficult for the treating physician to identify which patient is the best candidate for each one of these specific treatments especially in the clinical scenario of a patient in whom clinical characteristics overlap between different endotypes, allowing the selection of more than one biologic agent. As no head-to-head comparisons between these biologics have been attempted, there is no evidence on the superiority of one biologic agent over the other. Furthermore, a physician's first therapeutic decision, no matter how carefully has been made, may often result in suboptimal clinical response and drug discontinuation, indicating the need for switching to a different biologic. In this short review, we discuss the available evidence regarding the switching between biologics in patients with severe asthma and we propose a simple algorithm on switching possibilities in case that the physicians' initial choice is proven not to be the best.

### Guiding principles for use of newer biologics and bronchial thermoplasty for patients with severe asthma [^117HmiaT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe asthma poses significant disease-related and economic burdens in the United States. Challenges in practice include how to define "severe asthma" for a given patient, knowing which are the right tests to perform and when, and having a better understanding of a patient's asthma phenotype. Furthermore, current guidelines do not address a clear, practical approach to treatment that is based on a patient's asthma phenotype.

Objective

To develop a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, the role of biomarkers and phenotyping severe asthma, and the use of newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty to help guide practicing clinicians.

Methods

A roundtable meeting was convened with a panel of severe asthma experts to discuss areas in practice that are not adequately addressed by current guidelines, specifically phenotype-guided treatment.

Results

We describe a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, asthma phenotyping with the use of available biomarkers, and guiding principles for newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty.

Conclusion

To optimize therapy and improve outcomes such as daily symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, and hospitalizations, a clear picture of a patient's asthma phenotype is needed to guide therapy. Determining asthma phenotypes is the foundation of precision medicine for this persistent, often difficult-to-treat disease.

### Choosing the right biologic treatment for individual patients with severe asthma-lessons learnt from picasso [^114LLXff]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma represents a true challenge for clinicians from two basic perspectives, i.e.: a rational assessment of the underlying endo/phenotype and the subsequent selection of the best fitted (personalized) and effective treatment. Even though asthma is a heterogeneous disease, in the majority of therapy-compliant patients, it is possible to achieve (almost) complete disease control or even remission through conventional and quite uniform step-based pharmacotherapy, even without phenotyping. However, the absence of deeper assessment of individual patients revealed its handicap to its fullest extent during the first years of the new millennium upon the launch of biological therapeutics for patients with the most severe forms of asthma. The introduction of differentially targeted biologics into clinical practice became a challenge in terms of understanding and recognizing the etiopathogenetic heterogeneity of the asthmatic inflammation, pheno/endotyping, and, consequently, to choose the right biologic for the right patient. The answers to the following three questions should lead to correct identification of the dominant pheno/endotype: Is it really (severe) asthma? Is it eosinophilic asthma? If eosinophilic, is it (predominantly) allergen-driven? The identification of the best achievable and relevant alliance between endotypes and phenotypes ("euphenotypes") should be based not only on the assessment of the actual clinical characteristics and laboratory biomarkers, but more importantly, on the evaluation of their development and changes over time. In the current paper, we present a pragmatic three-step approach to severe asthma diagnosis and management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eivKt]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### Systematic literature review of systemic corticosteroid use for asthma management [^1137ycVX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of these new well-tolerated, effective, targeted biologic add-on treatments and the well-recognized AEs associated with SCS use, OCS are still treatment options in the current asthma treatment guidelines. The 2019 GINA guidelines recommend that if OCS are prescribed, they should be prescribed at lesser dosages. Prescribers should be fully aware of and monitor for AEs. OCS should be considered, along with targeted biologic treatments, for add-on treatment for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of high-dosage ICS therapy (GINA step 5 treatment). The GINA guidelines also recommend short-term OCS use for patients experiencing a severe exacerbation who do not respond to treatment. However, this guidance is relatively unspecific. Patients can repeatedly receive prescriptions for both short- and long-term OCS and ultimately become OCS dependent. The continued inclusion of OCS in guidelines, together with their worldwide easy accessibility, familiarity of use, and low acquisition costs compared with newer targeted treatments, contributes to the ongoing use of SCS for patients with severe asthma. In addition, it is likely that some patients fail to benefit significantly from the OCS-sparing effect of biologic treatments because of differences in their susceptibility to OCS-related adverse effects, or because of their unwillingness to initiate new treatment options and reduce OCS use.

The certainty of evidence is low for Fmonitoring to exert a change of at least the established MID using the ACT (MID, 3), Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MID, 0.5), or Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MID, 0.5). For each of these outcomes, the mean difference in scores between groups with and without Fmonitoring was less than 0.1.

It is not known whether the recommendation applies to children who do not have allergic asthma because atopy (defined based on a positive skin prick test result or elevated aero-allergen-specific IgE)and allergic asthma were inclusion criteria in most of the pediatric studies, or allergic asthma was highly prevalent in the study populations. For the studies of adults, the presence of atopy was less consistently reported, or was assessed as part of the study. Therefore, the evidence supporting this recommendation comes from mixed populations of allergic and nonallergic adults.

Studies evaluating the use of Fto help select or monitor responses to biologic agents, with the exception of omalizumab, were not available for assessment. Therefore, whether this recommendation applies to other biologic agents is not known.

### Stop the asthma treatment elevator, we need to get off! [^117T4M8i]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What can we learn from this approach? The domains of asthma risk include a short-term one, namely the impending risk of an asthma attack, but also, seriously, the risk of progression from mild to moderate disease to severe (or "too-late") disease. There is a huge and appropriate focus on severe asthma, but to what extent is severe asthma the consequence of inadequate earlier treatment of more mild disease and a failure to appreciate the underlying risk in some of these patients? In a recent study of asthma remission, still a concept for which there is no uniformly agreed-upon definition, the longer the duration of disease, the less likely remission was to be reached with any of the biological agents studied (omalizumab, anti–IL-5/IL-5 receptor, anti–IL-4 receptor-α). Remission was also likeliest in those with better lung function, fewer asthma attacks, lower oral corticosteroid exposure, and fewer symptoms. Surely this drives us to the hypothesis that the early institution of biologic agents while the disease is in the throes of early activity offers the best chance of attaining remission. If this hypothesis is correct (and of course, it must be proven prospectively or otherwise), we need markers of risk for progression to severe asthma in those with mild disease or we will bankrupt the health economy and risk poor patient engagement and inadequate treatment adherence by treating a high proportion of patients who are at low risk. The same study provides the clue: remission was likeliest in those with the highest biomarker levels. We know that a high blood eosinophil count and particularly a high F NO are predictors of accelerated deterioration in lung function, something that needs to be prevented if true asthma remission is to be attained. Another clue is from the START (inhaled Steroid Treatment as Regular Therapy in early asthma) study, which documented a more rapid decline in lung function in patients who had severe asthma attacks and were not prescribed inhaled corticosteroids. We propose that patients with mild to moderate asthma who have increased blood eosinophil count and F NO, especially if they are experiencing severe asthma attacks, are a high-risk group whose treatment should rapidly be escalated to biologic agents if standard therapy does not normalize the biomarkers and prevent attacks. Of course, determining whether this has resulted in the prevention of severe asthma will take years, but this aggressive approach would be justified by a much shorter-term study if attack frequency was reduced. In any case, there is plenty of scope to reduce the morbidity of so-called "mild" but highly active asthma.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^114ckC3A]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix G biological agents in asthma — referral and eligibility assessment states that patients for which biological agents are being considered should be referred from primary to specialty care, and primary care practitioners should consult a pulmonologist or allergist before offering biologics including omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab, and tezepelumab. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) testing can be a valuable tool to identify airway inflammation and can aid clinicians in selecting appropriate biologic therapies. Biologic agents targeting immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin‑5, interleukin‑4α, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are used as add‑on maintenance therapy for moderate‑to‑severe asthma inadequately controlled despite optimized inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other controller medications (long‑acting beta agonist [LABA], long‑acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA]) with proper technique and adherence, and compared to placebo these agents have reduced exacerbations and improved patient symptoms and quality of life.

Rationale and discussion

The data on the benefits and harms of BT derive primarily from three RCTs that enrolled a total of 432 patients in both the intervention and treatment arms. Overall, the improvements after BT were small, and the harms of BT were moderate. Long-term follow-up of a sufficient number of patients to fully assess clinical benefits and harms is lacking. The therapy may offer an acceptable benefit-to-harm ratio for some patients after careful shared decision making. Further research that includes randomized trials as well as long-term registry outcomes are desirable.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel identified the following research gaps:
Identify the population most likely to benefit from BT, such as individuals who have been treated unsuccessfully with different biologic agents.
Develop a registry to determine the risk of significant but rare long-term harms, such as bronchiectasis, vascular damage, and other lung complications. Follow both treated and untreated individuals over the long-term to determine whether side effects reported at 5 years in the AIR 2 studyare more common in individuals treated with BT than in a control group.
Conduct RCTs and long-term registry studies of BT for asthma treatment, with appropriate controls and a sufficient number of patients, to fully assess the clinical benefits and harms of BT.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^111i6wYB]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix G biologic indications and monitoring detail steroid-sparing evidence, age-based approvals, and continuation of controllers. An oral steroid-sparing effect with benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials in oral steroid–dependent patients; tezepelumab was not shown to reduce ICS dose while maintaining asthma control compared to placebo, and real-world studies with omalizumab have shown reduction in oral steroid maintenance doses. Omalizumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age and older with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen; mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab are indicated for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, with mepolizumab and benralizumab approved for those who are six years of age and older and reslizumab for those who are 18 years of age and older; dupilumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe asthma in those who are six years of age and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; tezepelumab is indicated for severe asthma in those who are 12 years of age or older without regards to phenotype or biomarkers; and higher blood eosinophils at baseline is a predictor of a good asthma outcome to biologic therapy. When biologics are started, other controller treatments are continued. Do not discontinue ICS. A trial of at least 4 months is needed to assess initial response, with assessments including asthma symptom control, exacerbations, lung function, side effects to therapy, and patient satisfaction, and where applicable, effects on type 2 co-morbidities such as nasal polyps and atopic dermatitis should be assessed.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112X1FMk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g. medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes.

GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS–formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ⩾60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA.

Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS–formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS–formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS–long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4.

Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Biologic therapies for severe asthma in school-age children [^117ELUk9]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with severe asthma incur substantial disease-related morbidity. Despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and additional controller medications, many patients continue to experience recurrent exacerbations, impaired lung function, and diminished quality of life. Most children with severe asthma demonstrate evidence of a phenotype consistent with ongoing type 2 inflammation. Fortunately, the advent of biologic therapies, monoclonal antibodies that target specific pathways relevant to asthma pathogenesis, has allowed most children with severe asthma to experience marked improvements in disease control and clinical outcomes. Four biologic medications that target various aspects of type 2 inflammation-specifically omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab-are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in children 6–11years of age with specific phenotypes of severe asthma. The selection of the most appropriate biologic for a patient's phenotype is driven by a biomarker-based approach, including assessments of blood eosinophil counts, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels, and allergic sensitization and total immunoglobulin E levels. These biologic medications have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the rates of asthma exacerbations between 27% and 59% relative to placebo, although they vary in their impact on lung function. The overall safety profiles of these biologics have been reassuring. This review discusses the role of biologics in childhood asthma, including the strategy for phenotyping patients, summarizes the data supporting the efficacy and safety of biologics in this population, and presents an approach for choosing a biologic and monitoring patient outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116RJgLJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer the following options when stepping down treatment:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 5. High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids|- Add biologic therapy in cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible and reduce oral corticosteroids <br/> -; optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose <br/> -; use sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids <br/> -; switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids|
|Step 5. Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA|- Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids, then consider reducing inhale corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonis dose|
|Step 4. Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment|- Continue combination ICS-LABA with 50% reduction in ICS component by using available formulations <br/> -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration <br/> -; switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, with lower maintenance dose|
|Step 4. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to low dose, and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever|
|Step 4. High-dose ICS plus second controller|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% and continue second controller|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance|- Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily <br/> -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol dose to once daily and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever <br/> -; consider stepping down to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol|
|Step 3. Medium or high-dose ICS|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% <br/> -; consider adding leukotriene receptor antagonists to allow ICS dose to be stepped down|
|Step 2. Low-dose maintenance ICS|- Switch to once-daily dosing - budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, fluticasone furoate <br/> -; switch to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol <br/> -; switch to taking ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -; do not discontinue ICS completely because the risk of exacerbations is increased with short-acting β-agonist-only treatment|

### Biologic therapies for severe asthma | NEJM resident 360… [^1165xLLp]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A: Severe asthma is heterogeneous biologically, with distinct patterns of airway inflammation defined by the predominant granulocyte in sputum or bronchial biopsy specimens and often identified by means of blood or exhaled-breath biomarkers. Type 2 high-inflammation asthma is characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation, which is associated with increased blood eosinophil counts or elevations of fractional exhaled nitric oxide, whereas type 2 low-inflammation asthma encompasses neutrophilic asthma and paucigranulocytic asthma. A: Type 2 cytokines include interleukin-5, interleukin-4, and interleukin-13. Interleukin-5 promotes proliferation, differentiation, activation, and survival of eosinophils. The numbers of eosinophils in peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and bronchial biopsy specimens directly correlate with the severity of asthma. Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, which share interleukin-4 receptor α, have many overlapping functions.

Interleukin-4 plays a key role in CD4+ type 2 helper T lymphocyte differentiation and drives IgE isotype switching in B lymphocytes. Interleukin-13 induces the contraction of airway smooth-muscle cells and stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase in bronchial epithelial cells, which leads to an increase in Feno. A: In clinical trials, several anticytokine antibodies enabled tapering of oral glucocorticoids with the use of predefined schedules while asthma control was maintained in adults with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma. Mepolizumab reduced the glucocorticoid dose by a median of 50%, as compared with placebo, while reducing the annualized rate of exacerbations by 32% and improving asthma control, findings that were supported by real-life observational studies.

Benralizumab significantly reduced the median oral glucocorticoid dose from baseline to 28 weeks, as compared with placebo. In contrast, neither fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab nor fixed-dose subcutaneous tezepelumab reduced the daily oral glucocorticoid dose in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma.

### Biologics for asthma and allergic skin diseases in children… [^116BtxBr]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome was ICS reduction. After 28 weeks of omalizumab therapy, the ICS dose was reduced, as tolerated, and the percentage of patients in whom ICS reduction occurred was 100% with omalizumab versus 66. 7% of the placebo group patients. Fewer participants had asthma exacerbations during the steroid reduction phase in the omalizumab group versus placebo. 7 Participants were randomly assigned 2: 1 to receive omalizumab or placebo, and there was a 24-week, fixed inhaled-steroid phase followed by a 28-week, adjustable ICS steroid phase. From the baseline period to week 24, there was a 31% reduction in exacerbations in the omalizumab group versus placebo and a 43% reduction in exacerbations over the entire study time frame with omalizumab versus placebo.

Mepolizumab Mepolizumab is a fully humanized anti–IL-5 antibody, currently approved in the United States for the add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma. 17 Mepolizumab binds to IL-5, blocking its interaction with the IL-5 receptor on the surface of eosinophils, obstructing its actions at that level. 18 The best response is observed in patients with eosinophil concentrations > 300 cells/μL. Reslizumab Reslizumab is another anti–IL-5 agent for use in severe asthma that binds to circulating IL-5 and downregulates the IL-5 signaling pathway. Benralizumab Benralizumab is the third of the anti–IL-5 monoclonal antibodies and induces a nearly complete reduction in eosinophil concentration by binding to the α chain of the IL-5 receptor on eosinophils and possibly inducing destruction by natural killer cells.

Similarly, in the SIROCCO study, researchers evaluated 1204 participants 12 to 75 years of age with severe asthma and found that in patients with eosinophil concentrations > 300 cells/μL, benralizumab reduced the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 48 weeks when given every 4 or 8 weeks and increased prebronchodilator FEV.

### Association between T2-related comorbidities and effectiveness of biologics in severe asthma… [^111gvo8n]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To determine the association between type 2-related comorbidities and biologic agent effectiveness in adults with severe asthma. STUDY POPULATION: This study included 1, 765 patients ≥ 18 years in the International Severe Asthma Registry who had severe asthma and type 2-related comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, chronic rhinosinusitis with or without NP, and/or atopic dermatitis and who were being treated with a biologic agent. Registry data were collected from patients in 21 countries between 2017 and 2022. n = 1257), anti-IgE, or anti-IL-4/13 biologic therapies were assessed to determine the association of the type 2 comorbidity on the effectiveness of biologic therapy for the treatment of asthma.

Asthma control outcomes were assessed before and after biologic therapy. Patients on anti-IL-5/5R therapy generally had more severe asthma and patients on anti-IL-4/13 generally had less severe asthma, although there were fewer subjects treated with anti-IL-4/13 therapy. Overall, all patients had improvement in all the asthma control outcomes on any biologic therapy. However, the subjects with NP versus without NP had greater postbiologic therapy improvement in exacerbation rate, asthma control, and lung function. When adjusted for blood eosinophil count, the difference was still present but not as significant.

Patients with CRS with or without NP or patients with NP alone experienced 22% to 23% fewer exacerbations per year and had 56% to 59% higher odds of better postbiologic therapy asthma control compared with subjects without CRS ± NP, or NP alone. AR and AD did not significantly influence biologic agent effectiveness for any outcome assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Severe asthma with comorbid CRS ± NP or NP alone may represent a distinct asthma phenotype associated with improved clinical and functional outcomes in response to biologic therapies. Comorbid AR and AD were not associated with improved effectiveness of biologics used to treat severe asthma.
