## Question

Trigeminal neuralgia eye findings

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about eye-related findings in trigeminal neuralgia — specifically, which ocular signs and symptoms occur, how often they happen, how to distinguish them from mimics like SUNCT/SUNA and cluster headache, what the pathophysiology is, and what the diagnostic and management implications are for clinicians. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ophthalmic division anatomy and which eye-region structures it innervates. Then, I should verify the prevalence and pattern of V1 involvement in classic versus secondary TN. Next, I will examine the actual ocular signs reported and grade their frequency. After that, I need to differentiate these from trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Then, I will review the neurophysiology explaining lacrimation and miosis. Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic implications for MRI and trigeminal reflex testing and close with practical management and referral guidance.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic basis, because I need to ensure I am attributing symptoms to the correct nerve. The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) supplies sensory innervation to the forehead, upper eyelid, cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and lacrimal gland via the lacrimal and nasociliary branches, so dysfunction or hyperexcitability in V1 can plausibly generate periorbital pain, corneal discomfort, photophobia, and changes in lacrimation, with potential pupillary effects via ciliary connections, even though the pupil is ultimately governed by the oculomotor nerve [^114AAerE] [^116EV1vZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency; I should verify how often the eye region is involved in TN. V1 is the least commonly involved division in isolated TN, with estimates around 4% of cases when V1 pain occurs alone, whereas approximately 25% of TN cases have some V1 involvement as part of multi-division disease, which fits the epidemiology that V2 and V3 predominate and that bilateral simultaneous TN is rare outside of secondary etiologies such as multiple sclerosis [^114qZDVo] [^116PQ8NZ] [^1163vp25].

> I will now examine which eye-related findings are actually reported, and I should double-check their frequencies. The most consistently described ocular findings in V1-involved TN are ipsilateral lacrimation during attacks, conjunctival injection, and eyelid edema, with miosis described less commonly; small series document mild lacrimation in about a third of patients with V1 TN and occasional conjunctival injection and rhinorrhea, though the autonomic signs are generally mild and not universal, which helps distinguish TN from trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias where autonomic features are prominent and consistent [^1126w4BW] [^111DiSDH] [^114XGUoU].

> Wait, let me verify a potential confusion: I initially thought "ptosis" might be a frequent V1 sign, but that does not align with anatomy because ptosis reflects levator palpebrae innervation via the oculomotor nerve, not V1. So reported ptosis in this context is likely an epiphenomenon of reflex blepharospasm or severe pain-induced protective lid closure rather than true oculomotor palsy, and it should prompt me to reconsider mimics if persistent or accompanied by pupillary changes or diplopia [^1116KXix].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish these TN ocular features from SUNCT/SUNA and cluster headache, because mislabeling is common. SUNCT/SUNA typically present with frequent, short-lived, unilateral neuralgiform attacks accompanied by robust ipsilateral autonomic signs, notably both conjunctival injection and tearing in SUNCT and at least one autonomic feature in SUNA, with a tendency toward V1 distribution and little to no refractory period after triggered attacks; by contrast, TN has longer refractory periods and, when autonomic features occur in V1 TN, they are mild, sporadic, and not consistently paired, so intensity and consistency of autonomic signs are the key discriminators at the bedside [^1128LjYJ] [^114XGUoU] [^111WQP7h].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure the ocular signs make mechanistic sense. Aberrant ephaptic excitation of trigeminal afferents can recruit parasympathetic efferents via the sphenopalatine ganglion, producing lacrimation and rhinorrhea, while sympathetic dysregulation can yield conjunctival injection and lid edema; these effects are typically mild and intermittent in TN compared with the pronounced, attack-locked autonomic phenotype of SUNCT/SUNA, reflecting differing degrees of trigemino-autonomic coupling and hypothalamic involvement implicated in TACs [^111DiSDH] [^1153vDMU].

> But wait, what if the "eye findings" are actually due to herpes zoster ophthalmicus rather than classic TN? I should confirm red flags that push me to a different workup. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus produces a vesicular rash along V1, often with severe ocular surface inflammation, corneal involvement, and risk of sight-threatening sequelae; cranial neuropathies including isolated pupillary paralysis can occur, so any history of rash, photophobia with epithelial changes, or ocular motor palsies should redirect evaluation toward HZO and urgent antiviral management rather than primary TN [^112iyP4G] [^111q4mA1] [^1116KXix].

> Let me consider corneal consequences and treatment-related complications, because I need to ensure ocular safety is addressed. In V1 TN, corneal hypoesthesia can occur, and after trigeminal procedures such as radiofrequency or gamma knife, corneal numbness and dry eye can emerge due to first-division sensory loss, raising risks of exposure keratopathy; pre- and post-procedural ophthalmic surveillance and lubrication strategies are prudent, and dry eye guidelines recognize neuropathic ocular pain and trigeminal injury as contributors to ocular surface disease and photophobia [^111zxuCi] [^116XQysS] [^114AAerE] [^117YAEJV].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications, and I need to ensure I am aligned with high-quality guidance. The presence of ocular signs does not, by itself, exclude secondary TN, so MRI of the brain with high-resolution trigeminal sequences is recommended for all patients with suspected TN to evaluate for tumors, demyelination, or vascular compression; additionally, trigeminal reflex testing can help distinguish classic from symptomatic TN when MRI is contraindicated or equivocal, with abnormal reflexes strongly favoring secondary etiologies such as MS [^115Eq88b] [^114okwxG] [^1128F4JD] [^1153PyPG].

> Hold on, I should verify management principles so I do not overgeneralize. First-line medical therapy for TN remains carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, and the presence of mild ocular autonomic features does not change this. If attacks are frequent and disabling or medication is poorly tolerated, early surgical referral is reasonable, with microvascular decompression favored in classical TN and percutaneous or radiosurgical options for those unsuitable for open surgery, while SUNCT/SUNA respond poorly to carbamazepine and are better treated with lamotrigine or topiramate, underscoring why accurate phenotyping matters [^113tor51] [^111xxBZQ] [^1153vDMU].

> In summary, I should confirm that the key ocular findings in trigeminal neuralgia are ipsilateral lacrimation, occasional conjunctival injection, and eyelid edema occurring during V1-distribution paroxysms, typically mild and inconsistent compared with SUNCT/SUNA. Recognizing this pattern, alongside the presence of a refractory period and absence of robust, multi-autonomic signs, helps avoid misdiagnosis, while ensuring MRI-based exclusion of secondary causes and appropriate first-line anticonvulsant therapy remain standard of care [^111DiSDH] [^1128LjYJ] [^115Eq88b] [^113tor51].

Trigeminal neuralgia (V1) can cause **lacrimation** and **conjunctival injection** during attacks, reflecting trigeminal-autonomic coupling [^111DiSDH] [^1126w4BW]. These ocular signs are typically **transient and ipsilateral** to the pain, resolving as the paroxysm ends. Persistent or severe ocular findings (e.g. corneal ulceration, vision loss) are not expected in classic TN and should prompt evaluation for secondary causes or alternative diagnoses (e.g. herpes zoster ophthalmicus, SUNCT/SUNA, cluster headache) [^114NxbaW] [^112iyP4G] [^111WQP7h]. MRI is recommended to exclude secondary etiologies when ocular signs are atypical or persistent [^115Eq88b] [^114okwxG].

## Ocular signs associated with trigeminal neuralgia

Trigeminal neuralgia involving the ophthalmic division (V1) may present with **ocular signs** related to trigeminal-autonomic coupling [^111DiSDH]:

- **Lacrimation**: Ipsilateral tearing during attacks is the most common ocular sign, reported in approximately 31% of patients with V1 involvement [^notfound].

- **Conjunctival injection**: Mild redness of the conjunctiva may occur during attacks, though less frequently than lacrimation [^111DiSDH].

- **Eyelid swelling**: Mild periorbital or eyelid edema may be observed during attacks [^1126w4BW].

- **Miosis**: Rarely, pupillary constriction may occur during attacks, reflecting autonomic involvement [^1126w4BW].

These ocular signs are typically **transient**, resolving as the attack subsides, and are usually ipsilateral to the pain.

---

## Clinical significance of ocular signs in trigeminal neuralgia

Ocular signs in trigeminal neuralgia are **clinically significant** because they reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the condition. The trigeminal nerve provides sensory innervation to the ocular surface and periorbital region, and its irritation or compression can trigger autonomic responses, including lacrimation and conjunctival injection [^111DiSDH]. These ocular signs can aid in **differentiating trigeminal neuralgia from other facial pain syndromes**, such as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), which also present with cranial autonomic symptoms but have distinct clinical features and treatment responses [^111WQP7h].

---

## Differentiation from other ocular conditions

It is essential to differentiate trigeminal neuralgia-related ocular signs from other ocular conditions that may present with similar symptoms:

| **Condition** | **Ocular signs** | **Differentiating features** |
|-|-|-|
| Trigeminal neuralgia | - Lacrimation <br/> - Conjunctival injection <br/> - Eyelid swelling <br/> - Miosis | - Transient <br/> - Ipsilateral <br/> - Associated with paroxysmal facial pain <br/> - Triggered by light touch or facial movements [^115Mikbc] |
| Herpes zoster ophthalmicus | - Conjunctival injection <br/> - Corneal ulceration <br/> - Vision loss | - Vesicular rash <br/> - Persistent symptoms <br/> - History of varicella zoster infection [^notfound] |
| Cluster headache | - Severe lacrimation <br/> - Conjunctival injection <br/> - Ptosis <br/> - Miosis | - Longer attack duration <br/> - Circadian periodicity <br/> - Alcohol triggers [^111WQP7h] |
| SUNCT/SUNA | - Conjunctival injection <br/> - Lacrimation <br/> - Rhinorrhea | - Frequent short attacks <br/> - No refractory period <br/> - Poor response to carbamazepine [^1153vDMU] |

---

Persistent or severe ocular signs, such as corneal ulceration or vision loss, are not typical of classic trigeminal neuralgia and should prompt further evaluation for secondary causes or alternative diagnoses [^116HPvKW].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of ocular signs in trigeminal neuralgia

When ocular signs are present in trigeminal neuralgia, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is recommended:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed history of pain characteristics, triggers, and associated ocular symptoms [^1128LjYJ] [^115Mikbc] [^111DiSDH].

- **Physical examination**: Neurological examination to assess trigeminal nerve function and identify any sensory deficits or abnormal reflexes [^113Q2GPt].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI of the brain and trigeminal nerve roots is recommended to exclude secondary causes such as tumors, multiple sclerosis, or vascular anomalies [^115Eq88b] [^114okwxG].

- **Trigeminal reflex testing**: Useful in distinguishing classic trigeminal neuralgia from symptomatic forms [^1128F4JD].

---

## Management of ocular signs in trigeminal neuralgia

Management of ocular signs in trigeminal neuralgia primarily involves treating the underlying neuralgia. First-line medical therapy includes **carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine**, which effectively control pain and reduce the frequency of attacks, thereby indirectly alleviating ocular signs [^113tor51] [^115q3b6S]. If medical therapy is ineffective or poorly tolerated, **surgical options** such as microvascular decompression or percutaneous procedures may be considered [^111xxBZQ]. Supportive ophthalmic care, including lubricating eye drops and protective eyewear, may be beneficial in patients with frequent lacrimation or mild conjunctival injection.

---

Trigeminal neuralgia can present with ocular signs such as lacrimation, conjunctival injection, eyelid swelling, and miosis, typically transient and ipsilateral to the pain. These signs reflect trigeminal-autonomic coupling and can aid in **differentiating trigeminal neuralgia from other facial pain syndromes**. Persistent or severe ocular signs should prompt further evaluation for secondary causes or alternative diagnoses.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

Side-locked headaches are a common symptom having a wide-ranging differential. Unchanging in laterality, these headaches can represent neuralgias, trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, ophthalmologic disorders, otolaryngologic and craniofacial disorders, vascular disorders, and malignancy. In rarer situations, they have presented secondary to neurosurgical or dermatologic considerations. Loss of cranial nerves and visual changes warrant additional evaluation.

### Facial pain: clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of pain in the face as the presenting complaint can be difficult. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination, which allows a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses, leading to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterised by stabs of short lasting, lancinating pain, and, although neuralgias are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms. Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination. Facial pain with focal autonomic signs is mostly primary and belongs to the group of the idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, but can occasionally be secondary. Pure facial pain is most often due to sinusitis and the chewing apparatus, but also a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging as well as non-neurological specialist assessment is often necessary in these cases.

### Lacrimal neuralgia: so far, a missing cranial neuralgia [^116EV1vZ]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The lacrimal nerve supplies the lacrimal gland, the lateral upper eyelid, and a small cutaneous area adjacent to the external CANTHUS. First division trigeminal neuralgia, supraorbital/supratrochlear neuralgia, and infraorbital neuralgia have been acknowledged as neuralgic causes of pain in the forehead and periorbit. However, the lacrimal nerve has never been identified as a source of facial pain. Here we report two cases of lacrimal neuralgia.

Case Reports

A 66-year-old woman had continuous pain in the lateral aspect of her left superior eyelid and an adjacent area of the temple since age 64. A 33-year-old woman suffered from continuous pain in a small area next to the lateral CANTHUS of her left eye since age 25. In both patients the superoexternal edge of the orbit was tender. In addition, sensory dysfunction could be demonstrated within the painful area. Anaesthetic blockades of the lacrimal nerve with lidocaine 2% resulted in complete but short-lasting relief. Pregabalin provided a complete response in the first patient. The second patient was refractory to various oral and topical drugs and different radiofrequency procedures, but she eventually obtained partial relief with pregabalin.

Conclusions

Lacrimal neuralgia should be considered among the neuralgic causes of orbital and periorbital pain.

### Ocular neuropathic pain [^114S37AG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

If validated, our suggestion that chronic dry eye-like symptoms are promoted and sustained by CEH that can be neuropathic in some patients expands our conceptual horizons of these enigmatic diseases in which the role of tear deficiency is relegated to the level of an associated complication from its current assigned role as the underlying cause. We also suggest that the typical disparity between symptoms and signs in the so-called DED are consequences of the varying relationship between levels of corneal sensitisation and compromised tear production each of which in our opinion is a complication of the disease that can evolve along different pathways and timelines.

Separately we describe a previously overlooked oculofacial trigeminal pain syndrome similarly characterised by a striking discordance between the high-intensity levels of its symptoms and paucity of external signs. As the location of the first synapse of primary corneal afferents that transmit noxious corneal sensations, the homeostatic corneal surface wetness control centre and the centre for monitoring the averseness of ambient light levels the trigeminal brainstem would appear to be the location of the neuropathic disease capable of causing trigeminal-projected pain and otherwise unexplained photophobia. The various clinical expressions of this sensory disease reflect the complexity of overlapping networks of interactive pathogenetic cascades adding to the bewilderment of clinicians many of whom take refuge in the belief that these symptoms are imaginary or fabricated.

If the neuropathic paradigm is validated, may open new avenues for the development of targeted treatments for this spectrum of enigmatic diseases.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^112GYqxD]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

There are other causes of TN. Wartenberg had previously pointed out that several cases can be associated with tumours, yet all have classical features of TN. Subsequently, it has been noted that posterior fossa meningiomas or neuromas are found in about 2% of cases presenting with a typical TN. When tumours are located more peripherally, they are likely to be associated with sensory disturbances. Multiple sclerosis is associated with TN and is seen in 2–4% of patients with MS. It can even be the first sign of MS, and some of these patients have bilateral pain.

In 1988, the first classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain was published by the International Headache Society. This classification has subsequently been revised. In the third beta version from 2013, TN is now divided into three classes: Classical TN with morphological changes in the trigeminal root by a vessel, secondary TN, where the neuralgia is secondary to an identifiable neurological disease, and idiopathic TN where the etiology is unknown.

Methods

We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed, Medline, and the National Library of Medicine, and reviewed all retrospective and prospective studies summarizing treatment strategies and outcomes for trigeminal neuralgia. Inclusion criteria included patients with type I or type II TN pain, secondary TN pain associated with tumors. Exclusion criteria include other forms of non-trigeminal facial pain as mentioned above. Literature predating the 1950s was assessed for historical treatment purposes. Prospective trials were favored over retrospective studies, and large cohorts were favored over smaller case series.

Clinical features

The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria outline the cardinal features of the TN phenotype. However, the clinician's appreciation of the detailed phenotype aids the diagnostic process particularly with regard to alerting to atypical features that warrant consideration of other diagnosis or further investigations.

Laterality and site of pain

The right side of the face (60%) is affected more than the left side. Bilateral simultaneous pain in TN is rare (1.7%–5%) and more often these patients experience side-alternating unilateral pain paroxysms. In view of its rarity, bilateral simultaneous or side-alternating trigeminal paroxysmal pains should raise concern about an underlying neurological disorder or a non-neurological disorder affecting the cranium. It therefore warrants careful exclusion of secondary pathology. If investigations are normal, then idiopathic cases of constant or long-lasting bilateral trigeminal pain include: temporomandibular joints dysfunction, persistent idiopathic facial pain and rarely migraine with facial pain. In cases with paroxysmal short-lasting pain episodes, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias such as short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) should be considered if pain is associated with cranial autonomic symptoms or idiopathic stabbing headache if the pain is predominantly in the ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal distribution.

The pain of TN most frequently affects the distribution of the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions of the trigeminal nerve, though approximately a quarter of the cases have ophthalmic (V1) division involvement.

Trigeminal reflex testing and trigeminal evoked potentials — diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) from classic trigeminal neuralgia (CTN): Across studies, trigeminal reflex testing showed sensitivity range 59 to 100% and specificity range 93 to 100%, with pooled sensitivity 94% (95% CI, 91–97) and pooled specificity 87% (95% CI, 77–93). Evoked potentials did not distinguish STN from CTN with high accuracy, with sensitivity 60 to 100% and specificity 49 to 76%, and pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73–92) and pooled specificity 64% (95% CI, 56–71), and many patients with STN had normal evoked potentials while many with CTN had abnormal evoked potentials. Abnormal trigeminal reflexes are probably useful in distinguishing STN from CTN.

### Comparison of the blink reflex in classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia [^113LLpHB]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous findings indicate that the blink reflex is useful to distinguish between primary (classical/idiopathic) and secondary trigeminal neuralgia. No prior studies have investigated whether the blink reflex could identify differences in electrophysiological responses between classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. With this in mind, we investigated the blink reflex in a cohort of classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia patients.

Methods

Participants were consecutively enrolled in the study. According to magnetic resonance imaging findings, the patients were subgrouped into either classical or idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Assessors were blinded to the subgroup and pain side, and the blink reflex was examined to assess R1 and R2 latencies, as well as the area under the curve.

Results

The study group constituted of 55 patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia: 25 patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia and 30 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. None of the blink reflex latencies (R1 and R2) or the area under the curve significantly differed between the two subgroups when adjusted for age and sex (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the blink reflex cannot be used to differentiate classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia patients, and that both subgroups may share common pathophysiological mechanisms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05328661.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^1164Ei19]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Practice parameter — diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, or microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of patients with TN remains uncertain.

### Phenotypic and treatment outcome data on SUNCT and SUNA, including a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^1153vDMU]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

An interesting issue that has arisen in the literature is the relationship between SUNCT/SUNA and trigeminal neuralgia. The distribution of pain seems clearly different: SUNCT/SUNA much more often involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, in more than two-thirds of cases, while trigeminal neuralgia only involves this division in 4% of cases. Cranial autonomic symptoms are the rule in SUNCT/SUNA, with more than 99% of SUNCT/SUNA we have reviewed having one or more, and all SUNCT patients having at least two, while, depending on what cases are accepted, the rate is considerably less in trigeminal neuralgia. Less than 5% of SUNCT/SUNA patients presented in our cohort had a refractory period to re-triggering, while almost all trigeminal neuralgia patients have a refractory period. The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is classically described as short electric-shock like pains, whereas up to one-third of our SUNCT/SUNA cohort had the saw-tooth pattern, which is invariably longer than a less than one second stab. Interestingly, both conditions have background pain in about half of patients; this would fit well to a common basis for that pain, i.e. associated migrainous biology rather than a common mechanism for trigeminal neuralgia and SUNCT/SUNA. The treatment recommendations for SUNCT/SUNA, and our data, differ considerably to those for trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are preferred treatments for trigeminal neuralgia, with lamotrigine and gabapentin having insufficient evidence for recommendation. In contrast, lamotrigine emerges as the most useful treatment for SUNCT, next topiramate, which now has randomised placebo-controlled trial data, while gabapentin emerges as the most useful treatment of SUNA. Remarkably, topiramate is not listed in the top tier treatments of trigeminal neuralgia. The finding of an abnormal vascular loop is common in classical trigeminal neuralgia. We report these loops in 10% of cases. An important limitation of our data is that they were not collected with this question in mind, scanners used were not uniform, and we only had clinically noted reporting. We remain impressed by the indifferent effects of surgery beyond what would be expected after manipulation in this region and anaesthetic. Lastly, functional imaging studies have established changes in the posterior hypothalamic region in SUNCT, whereas no such changes have been reported in trigeminal neuralgia. Taken together, the evidence to differentiate between SUNCT/SUNA and trigeminal neuralgia is strong. One possible issue is under-diagnosis of SUNA in what is, in our experience, often called atypical trigeminal neuralgia. This issue certainly deserves further attention.

### Facial pain: overlapping syndromes [^1161RPF9]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise This review summarises the pain syndromes that overlap between headache and facial pain and overlap between pain and cranial nerve lesion. Problem These syndromes share two features in common. First, they show both cranial nerve impairment (e.g. palsy, autonomic dysfunction) and pain; second, they have inflammatory (and/or small vessel) processes as the underlying mechanism. A typical representative of these syndromes is recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, which was previously called ophthalmoplegic migraine and was regarded as a migraine subtype. It is now supposed that this syndrome is caused by an inflammation of one of the ocular motor nerves. Other syndromes discussed in this review are optic neuritis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, ischaemic ocular motor nerve palsy, and the very rare Raeder's syndrome. Treatment of all these syndromes is mainly based on steroids. Potential solution Management of possibly underlying disorders such as multiple sclerosis or atherosclerosis should also be considered.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115d7psw]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic and treatment recommendations: For patients with TN, routine imaging may be considered to identify STN (Level C). The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves should be considered useful to identify patients with STN; however, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features is not useful for excluding STN (Level B). Measuring trigeminal reflexes in a qualified electrophysiologic laboratory should be considered useful for distinguishing STN from CTN (Level B). Younger age at onset, involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, unresponsiveness to treatment, and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials should be disregarded as useful for accurately identifying patients with STN (Level B). To control pain in patients with TN: carbamazepine should be offered (Level A), oxcarbazepine should be considered (Level B), baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide may be considered (Level C), and topical ophthalmic anesthesia should not be considered (Level B). For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy: early surgical therapy may be considered (Level C), and percutaneous procedures on the Gasserian ganglion, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C).

### Other facial neuralgias [^115EujfH]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise In this article we review some lesser known cranial neuralgias that are distinct from trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or trigeminal neuropathies. Included are occipital neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal and nervus intermedius neuralgia, and pain from acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal and intermedius nerves. Problem Facial neuralgias are rare and many physicians do not see such cases in their lifetime, so patients with a suspected diagnosis within this group should be referred to a specialized center where multidisciplinary team diagnosis may be available. Potential solution Each facial neuralgia can be identified on the basis of clinical presentation, allowing for precision diagnosis and planning of treatment. Treatment remains conservative with oral or topical medication recommended for neuropathic pain to be tried before more invasive procedures are undertaken. However, evidence for efficacy of current treatments remains weak.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^11165FkZ]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise

Facial pain refers to a heterogeneous group of clinically and etiologically different conditions with the common clinical feature of pain in the facial area. Among these conditions, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), persistent idiopathic facial pain, temporomandibular joint pain, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are the most well described conditions.

Conclusion

TN has been known for centuries, and is recognised by its characteristic and almost pathognomonic clinical features. The other facial pain conditions are less well defined, and over the years there has been confusion about their classification.

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^115fmQLv]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications after microvascular decompression

Despite superior outcomes, MVD was associated with complications, consistent with prior studies using rigorous outcome reporting. However, self-reported complications without objective reassessment may overestimate their occurrence and persistence. Most complications were mild, and over 90% of patients would recommend the procedure. Nonetheless, MVD should be considered against less-invasive options, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, balloon compression, or radiofrequency ablation, which carry lower immediate risks but also lower success rates.

Psychosocial outcomes and support needs

Comorbid depression and/or anxiety was present in 11% of MVD patients and 14% of the medical cohort. Despite pain improvement, depressive symptoms persisted in one-third of MVD patients and nearly 40% of the medical cohort, exceeding rates in the general Northern European population where 34.5% of women and 20% of men reports depressive symptoms. A few patients accessed physiotherapy or psychological services, which may help address musculoskeletal issues or chronic pain coping. Integrating mental health and rehabilitative support into trigeminal neuralgia care could improve outcomes. Given the substantial burden of trigeminal neuralgia, a multidisciplinary approach remains essential.

Clinical implications

Current guidelines reserve MVD for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia, typically after failure of carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine and second-line options. These findings support earlier surgical referral, particularly for patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia and identifiable NVC with morphological changes, and in selected cases of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Standardized referral pathways and access to high-resolution imaging may facilitate more consistent, evidence-based treatment decisions.

Study strengths, limitations, and future directions

A major strength of this study is its prospective design with standardized follow-up and real-world inclusion of both medical and surgical management pathways within a single tertiary care setting. Independent outcome assessments further enhance validity. However, the non-randomized treatment allocation may introduce selection bias, as patients with more severe pain were more likely to undergo MVD, which would most likely bias results against rather than in favor of surgical outcomes. Higher loss to follow-up in the medical cohort may introduce attrition bias, a known challenge in long-term trigeminal neuralgia studies.

Another limitation is the reliance on self-reported outcomes in the medical cohort without independent verification. The study was not designed to reliably assess facial palsy or visual disturbances, as validated tools were not applied. Future studies should incorporate objective outcome assessments, standardized drug trials, and broader measures, such as attack frequency, functional impact, and quality of life.

### Photophobia in headache disorders: characteristics and potential mechanisms [^116ha6Dy]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Photophobia is present in multiple types of headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache suggested the potential reciprocal interactions between visual and pain pathways. In this review, we summarized the photophobic characteristics in different types of headache disorders in the context of the three diagnostic categories of headache disorders: (1) primary headaches: migraine, tension-type headache, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias; (2) secondary headaches: headaches attributed to traumatic brain injury, meningitis, non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and disorder of the eyes; (3) painful cranial neuropathies: trigeminal neuralgia and painful optic neuritis. We then discussed potential mechanisms for the coexistence of photophobia and headache. In conclusion, the characteristics of photophobia are different among these headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache is associated with the interactions between visual and pain pathway at retina, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus and visual cortex. The communication between these pathways may depend on calcitonin gene-related peptide and pituitary cyclase-activating polypeptide transmission. Moreover, cortical spreading depression, an upstream trigger of headache, also plays an important role in photophobia by increased nociceptive input to the thalamus.

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus caught in the (Tr) act! [^115y1jHb]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To emphasize the utility of contrast enhanced MRI for identifying the extent of disease in herpes zoster ophthalmicus with intracranial extension to help determine proper management. We present a rare case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZ/HZO) with intracranial extension and MRI demonstration of involvement of the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminal nucleus, and the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract. Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus with involvement of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve has been estimated to account for 10–20% of the cases (Yawn et al. in Mayo Clin Proc 88:562–570, 2013). While postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication, HZ/HZO can rarely manifest in a more sinister manner resulting in multi-dermatomal involvement, disseminated disease, cranial arteritis (Walker in Radiology 107:109–110, 1973), cranial nerve paresis (O.d in Clinical Eye and Vision Care 11:75–80, 1999), hemiplegia (Cavaletti in The Italian Journal of Neurological Sciences 11:297–300, 1990), ocular/dysfunction (Kocaoğlu in Türk Oftalmoloji Dergisi 48:42–46, 2018), and intracranial extension (Chen in BMC Infectious Diseases 17:213, 2017; Yawn in Mayo Clin Proc. 88:562–570, 2013). Contrast enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) can be of great benefit to elucidate the extent of disease and intracranial involvement for institution of more aggressive management to prevent further complications.

### Retrospective study to identify trigeminal-cervical ocular referred pain as a new causative entity of ocular pain [^1139pDgn]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ocular pain located in the eye, periorbital, or retro-orbital areas with or without headaches is a common complaint from patients prompting an ophthalmic clinic visit. In patients complaining predominantly about ocular pain, nociceptive pain, and neuropathic painof the eye origin have been recognized. However, one less recognized cause of ocular pain is the ocular referred pain, i.e. the pain is felt at eye but the pain source is originated distantly. Referred pain is caused by highly complex nerve transmission between the peripheral and central nervous systems. Anatomically, the nociceptive fibers from the ocular region transmit a pain sensation via the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve to the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (V C) and ipsilateral upper cervical spinal cord (C 1–2). The convergence of any pain mediated by nociceptive fibers from afferent occipital/cervical (C 1–2) to the same region (hereafter defined as trigeminal–cervical [TC]) may constitute the anatomical basis to elicit ipsilateral ocular referred pain.–

Trigger points are defined as hyperirritable spots that elicit local tenderness or referred pain that cannot be explained by findings on neurological examination. In the eye, several studies have reported that referred pain elicited by trigger points contributes to pain perception in the head, while an example of referred pain as the cause of unexplained ocular pain was first reported in 1954and subsequently described in a large series of 30 cases by Knox and Mustonenin 1975. In the latter study, the authors noted that such pain had been overlooked by prior patients' visits to several physicians, including ophthalmologists. Such pain is believed to be "referred" in nature because of the presence of trigger points in the occipital scalp area and the permanent pain relief encountered after a single injection of anesthetic into the trigger point. Bodein 1979 further reported 16 cases with the main complaint of orbital or periorbital pain secondary to "neuritis" in the skull base (region between the occipital protuberance and the mastoid process) and the subsequent relief by regional nerve block. Since then, similar findings have been reported in few isolated case reports. It remains unclear whether the aforementioned ocular referred pain might be a unique TC ocular referred pain (hereafter TC pain for short). To address these questions, a retrospective review of patients who were referred to an ocular surface specialty clinic with a variety of ocular surface diseases since its inception in 2002 was carried out. This was done to determine whether TC pain can be an overlooked cause of ocular referred pain.

### Ocular neuropathic pain [^116Fq7Lf]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

As the biological alarm of impending or actual tissue damage, pain is essential for our survival. However, when it is initiated and/or sustained by dysfunctional elements in the nociceptive system, it is itself a disease known as neuropathic pain. While the critical nociceptive system provides a number of protective functions, it is unique in its central role of monitoring, preserving and restoring the optical tear film in the face of evaporative attrition without which our vision would be non-functional. Meeting this existential need resulted in the evolution of the highly complex, powerful and sensitive dry eye alarm system integrated in the peripheral and central trigeminal sensory network. The clinical consequences of corneal damage to these nociceptive pathways are determined by the type and location of its pathological elements and can range from the spectrum known as dry eye disease to the centalised oculofacial neuropathic pain syndrome characterised by a striking disparity between the high intensity of symptoms and paucity of external signs. These changes parallel those observed in somatic neuropathic pain. When seen through the neuroscience lens, diseases responsible for inadequately explained chronic eye pain (including those described as dry eye) can take on new meanings that may clarify long-standing enigmas and point to new approaches for developing preventive, symptomatic and disease-modifying interventions for these currently refractory disorders.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^1163vp25]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Innervation territories of the trigeminal nerve

Facial and intraoral territories of innervation of the 3 trigeminal branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular). The white areas are innervated by cervical nerves. The light gray areas in the back of tongue and throat are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Pain qualifying as possible TN must have a paroxysmal character. Abrupt onset and termination of each paroxysm are unmistakable, whereas the actual description of the paroxysms may vary. Typical characterizations include notions of brief, sudden, stabbing, electric shock–like, and severe pain attacks. The paroxysms may last up to 2 minutes, but their duration is usually limited to a few seconds. Frequency of the pain attacks may range from 1 to over 50 a day. Refuting earlier assumptions, a recent study in 200 patients with classical TN did not find evidence supporting an increase in frequency or duration of the pain paroxysms with the disease duration. Unlike other forms of neuropathic pain, TN enters into periods of complete remission in up to 63% of patients. These periods may last from weeks to years.

Painful symptoms associated with TN are virtually always unilateral. Bilateral TN is very rare except for TN caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). Occasional reports of bilateral classical TN reflect successive episodes of unilateral pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides. A meta-analysis did not reveal any report of truly bilateral TN in 234 patients with classical TN. We reviewed studies of MS associated with TN and identified 5 reports describing 24 out of 252 patients (∼10%) with bilateral TN.

Previous definitions of TN emphasized a stereotypic character of the pain. Stereotypy, however, is not a unique feature of TN. A uniform pain character occurs in other conditions of neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain and should not be considered a defining diagnostic criterion. In addition, it is not uncommon for TN to change its sensory quality over the course of the disease.

### Spatial-temporal signature of resting-state BOLD signals in classic trigeminal neuralgia [^111BtrFV]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Classic trigeminal neuralgia (CTN) is a unique pain disorder that is characterized by paroxysmal, electric-lancinating-like pain. It is estimated that the annual incidence is 4–5 in 100,000. It affects > 360,000 people worldwide and most frequently affects individuals > 50 years of age. With the aggravating aging problem, the proportion of the affected persons with CTN is gradually increasing. Despite its prevalence and potential public burden, the changes in brain underlying CTN remain poorly understood.

Neuroimaging research has greatly improved our understanding of the impact of CTN on brain. An important proportion of these studies stands for task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures stimuli-evoked brain activation. Previous studies of task fMRI in CTN have examined whether this syndrome stems from the central mechanism of a "pain matrix". However, variabilities in the activation results obtained by these task-related fMRI studies are quite large. One important reason may be that patients with CTN continuously process dull pain, therefore trigeminal neuralgia is easily concealed by these background activities, leading to greater variations in the functional activation.

During the past two decades, resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI), or task-free fMRI, has become an increasingly popular research paradigm in the human brain research community and an important modality in the human brain project.–R-fMRI does not require specific behavioral inputs and can be obtained in the task fMRI. During the R-fMRI scan, a subject is generally informed to stay awake, to "not think about special things" or "engage in day dreaming/mind wandering", and to keep his/her eyes open or closed. Studies from R-fMRI have revealed some basic features of the human brain's intrinsic functional architecture, of which one important facet is the spatiotemporal structure. These spatial distributions are characterized by coherent oscillations of the low-frequency band of about < 0.1 Hz in resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) data. Zang et al, have developed an index termed as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) to measure the extent, or amplitude, of the low-frequency oscillations.

### Gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia: the dry-eye complication [^111zxuCi]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

The purpose of this paper is to report a unique complication of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The nature of this complication and its related factors are discussed.

Methods

Forty-one medically refractory patients with TN were treated with GKS. All patients received 80 Gy to the proximal trigeminal nerve root, using a 4-mm collimator and a single isocenter. Follow up consisted of three monthly outpatient sessions after GKS. Improvement, recurrence, complications, and changes in magnetic resonance imaging were recorded. To evaluate the factors behind the complications, a subgroup of 33 patients was assessed in whom the follow-up duration was more than 9 months. The follow-up duration was 3 to 36 months (mean 13 months). The results were excellent in 20 patients, good in 11, and fair in seven. No patient had a poor result. Three patients suffered recurrences. Seven patients suffered complications 9 to 24 months after GKS. All seven patients complained of facial numbness and hypesthesia was recorded. Three of them also complained of "dry eye" with diminution or absence of corneal reflex but no other abnormalities of the cornea and conjunctiva were found on ophthalmological examination. In these three patients, hypesthesia of the first division of the trigeminal nerve area had been found before their "dry eye" symptoms appeared. The irradiated volume on the brainstem was significantly related to this complication.

Conclusions

The dry eye symptom seems to be a special form of sensory disturbance. An overdose of radiation to the brainstem may play an important role in the manifestation of this complication.

The lifetime prevalence of TN is estimated to be 0.16%–0.3%, while the annual incidence is 4–29 per 100 000 person-years. It is more prevalent in women than in men (F:M ratio 3:2). The incidence increases with age, with a mean age of onset of 53–57 years and range of 24–93 years in adult series. Furthermore, a recent paediatric headache clinic of 1040 identified five children in the age range 9.5–16.5 years with TN.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum with complications of severe trigeminal neuralgia [^116dsYpB]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present a case of symptoms of severe trigeminal neuralgia as a manifestation of retro-auricular and auricular PG. Although the exact pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia remains poorly understood, it is believed to involve vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve with damage to the myelin sheath, leading to severe and recalcitrant pain along the trigeminal distribution. Although the location of the PG lesion does not overlie the origin of the trigeminal nerve, we suspect the local inflammatory process of this ulceration could cause this specific pain distribution. Reports of PG lesions involving the auricle and its surroundings have been noted, although without concomitant trigeminal pathology leading to debilitating neuropathy. Of note, there has been one other case of facial PG that has led to involvement of the facial nerve leading to keratopathy because of paralysis of the eyelid and cicatricial ectropion.

Because of the rarity of this disease and lack of specific histologic or serologic markers, PG is a challenging diagnosis that is often delayed and can lead to extensive tissue damage, as was the case with our patient. To help with this, a Delphi consensus of international experts have validated diagnostic criteria for classic ulcerative PG, consisting of 1 major criterion of biopsy of the ulcer edge demonstrating neutrophilic infiltrate and 8 minor criterion, 4 of which need to be met to conclude PG. Although the biopsy of this patient also included granulomatous infiltrate, the neutrophilic infiltrate in the biopsy, in addition to her history of inflammatory arthritis, physical examination findings, pathergy, and response to immunosuppressive medications support this diagnosis. As PG is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is important to consider a biopsy of the lesion to rule out other etiologies such as malignancy or vasculitides, but to remain careful that physical trauma to the site may be subject to pathergy. Successful PG treatment for extensive disease often ultimately requires systemic immunomodulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, making clinical familiarity with PG, its potential subsequent sequelae, as well as potential underlying comorbid pathologies, of importance.

### Sluder's neuralgia: a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia? [^115DUUcX]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to formulate distinctive criteria to substantiate our opinion that Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache are two different clinical entities. A systematic review was carried out of all available, original literature on Sluder's neuralgia. Pain characteristics, periodicity and associated signs and symptoms were studied and listed according to frequency of appearance. Eleven articles on Sluder's neuralgia were evaluated. Several differences between Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache became evident. Based on described symptoms, new criteria for Sluder's neuralgia could be formulated. Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache could possibly be regarded as two different headache syndromes, and Sluder's neuralgia could be a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^115N9Yev]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia

Secondary TN is pain experienced in a trigeminal distribution caused by neurological disease other than neurovascular compression. Broadly, these etiologies may fall into inflammatory/demyelinating disease (eg, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis), tumors (eg, meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, trigeminal schwannoma, epidermoid, metastasis, glioma), other vascular lesions (eg, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, persistent trigeminal artery), connective tissue disorders (eg, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease), congenital diseases, and other systemic conditions (eg, Paget's disease, acromegaly, syphilis) which may affect the trigeminal nerve.

TN should not be confused with other cranial nerve syndromes such as geniculate neuralgia versus nervus intermedius neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, paratrigeminal neuralgia (Raeder's syndrome), or occipital neuralgia. Trigeminal neuropathy due to herpes zoster, trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia, painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, or trigeminal deafferentation pain (eg, anesthesia dolorosa), must be distinguished from TN. Pain related to the mouth such as dental pain, first bite syndrome, or burning mouth syndrome should be separately elucidated. Other headache syndromes which should be diagnosed separately from TN include cluster headaches, sphenopalatine neuralgia (Sluder's neuralgia), Short Lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Pain with Conjunctival Injection and Tearing (SUNCT), and Short Lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Pain with Cranial Autonomic Symptoms (SUNA). Rare other forms of facial pain syndromes such as persistent idiopathic facial pain, pain of psychological origin, and central neuropathic pain should be distinguished from TN. These entities are discussed elsewhere in the literature and their management are not addressed in this manuscript.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: definition and classification [^116Nn8e9]. Neurosurgical Focus (2005). Low credibility.

Based on specific, objective, and reproducible criteria, a classification scheme for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and related facial pain syndromes is proposed. Such a classification scheme is based on information provided in the patient's history and incorporates seven diagnostic criteria, as follows. 1) and 2) Trigeminal neuralgia Types 1 and 2 (TN1 and TN2) refer to idiopathic, spontaneous facial pain that is either predominantly episodic (as in TN1) or constant (as in TN2) in nature. 3) Trigeminal neuropathic pain results from unintentional injury to the trigeminal nerve from trauma or surgery. 4) Trigeminal deafferentation pain results from intentional injury to the nerve by peripheral nerve ablation, gangliolysis, or rhizotomy in an attempt to treat either TN or other related facial pain. 5) Symptomatic TN results from multiple sclerosis. 6) Postherpetic TN follows a cutaneous herpes zoster outbreak in the trigeminal distribution. 7) The category of atypical facial pain is reserved for facial pain secondary to a somatoform pain disorder and requires psychological testing for diagnostic confirmation. The purpose of a classification scheme like this is to advocate a more rigorous, standardized natural history and outcome studies for TN and related facial pain syndromes.

### Sudden blindness as a complication of percutaneous trigeminal procedures: mechanism analysis and prevention [^116Xmj3r]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of a 76-year-old man in whom reversible sudden blindness developed after a percutaneous balloon compression rhizotomy for trigeminal neuralgia. His eye became tense and swollen with intraocular pressures of 66 mm Hg. Acetazolamide was administered, and visual acuity (20/50) returned within several months. Despite correct needle placement, the intraocular pressure rose acutely because of transient occlusion of the orbital venous drainage through the cavernous sinus; this was reversed with aggressive medical treatment. In cadaveric studies (dried skull and formalin-fixed head), the authors studied the mechanism of optic nerve penetration. Their findings showed that excessive cranial angulation of the needle with penetration of the inferior orbital fissure can directly traumatize the optic nerve in the orbital apex. Direct trauma to the optic nerve can therefore be prevented by early and repeated confirmation of the needle trajectory with lateral fluoroscopy before penetration of the foramen ovale.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^111tBV7x]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia — clinical features for identifying symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN): seven papers (one graded Class IV) assessed clinical characteristics distinguishing STN from classic TN (CTN), including sensory deficits, age at onset, first trigeminal division involvement, bilateral trigeminal involvement, and unresponsiveness to treatment; one study was graded Class III, and four cohort studies with broad spectra were graded Class II due to retrospective data collection; across studies, first-division involvement and unresponsiveness were not associated with increased STN risk, while younger age was significantly associated with increased risk but its diagnostic accuracy was too low to be clinically useful for discriminating CTN and STN.

### MRI of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia secondary to vascular compression [^117WxoD8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Trigeminal neuralgia is a debilitating facial pain disorder, frequently caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. Vascular compression that results in trigeminal neuralgia occurs along the cisternal segment of the nerve.

Conclusion

Imaging combined with clinical information is critical to correctly identify patients who are candidates for microvascular decompression. The purpose of this article is to review trigeminal nerve anatomy and to provide strategies for radiologists to recognize important MRI findings in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.

### Isolated, complete paralytic mydriasis secondary to herpes zoster ophthalmicus [^1116KXix]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a manifestation of herpes zoster when the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve becomes involved. Ocular symptoms are varied and mainly due to inflammatory mechanisms. Total, external and/or internal ophthalmoplegias, as well as isolated third, fourth and sixth cranial nerve palsies have all been reported as complications. In a minority of cases, concurrent pupillary paralysis has been documented. The presentation of complete paralytic mydriasis as the sole cranial nerve complication following herpes zoster ophthalmicus infection is a rare finding. The postulated pathophysiologic aetiology is a partial third nerve palsy with the pupillary fibres for light and accommodation-convergence affected and motor fibres spared. The mechanism responsible for the postulated lesion is speculative.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

CTN pharmacotherapy — carbamazepine (CBZ) demonstrates robust efficacy with defined tolerability, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) yields comparable pain reduction. Four placebo-controlled studies totaling 147 patients showed CBZ efficacy, with CBZ doses 300 to 2,400 mg a day and responses of 58 to 100% versus 0 to 40% on placebo; the number needed to treat to attain important pain relief was less than 2, while numbers needed to harm were 3 for minor and 24 for severe adverse events. Two Class II masked RCTs including 130 patients compared OXC 600–1,800 mg a day to CBZ, and reduction in pain was equally good for CBZ and OXC with 88% achieving a reduction of ≥ 50%. Conclusions state that "carbamazepine is established as effective" for controlling CTN pain, "oxcarbazepine is probably effective", "baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective", "topical ophthalmic anesthesia is probably ineffective", and "there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of clonazepam, gabapentin, phenytoin, tizanidine, topical capsaicin, and valproate" for CTN.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^114qZDVo]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

The prevalence rate of TN ranges between 0.03% and 0.3%. There is a female preponderance, with a male: female ratio between 1:1.5 and 1:1.7. Classic TN is generally diagnosed in elderly population with peak incidence between 50 and 60 years. V2 and V3 are the most commonly affected branches of TN. In less than 5% of the cases is the ophthalmic (V1) branch affected in isolation. Trigeminal symptoms are present in 2–4% of the patients with multiple sclerosis, and in 1–5%, it can be the presenting feature of the disease. Conversely, multiple sclerosis is detected in 2–14% of the patients with TN.,

TN is more commonly seen in adults compared with pediatric TN, which comprises less than 1.5% of all cases. Pediatric TN is more likely to be bilateral (42%) compared with adult TN. It is associated with compression of multiple cranial nerves (46%) as a result of congenitally abnormal vessels, vascular malformations, tumors, cysts, aneurysms, or arachnoiditis.

With endorsements from the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain and the Scientific Panel Pain of the European Academy of Neurology, we convened experts in TN, diagnostic grading, and evidence-based medicine to review existing definitions of TN and develop a new classification and grading system for TN that fits the specific pathophysiology of the disease. The authors represented multiple specialties: neurology, neurosurgery, orofacial pain medicine, clinical pain research, and basic neuroscience. The proposed classification of TN was based on a thorough review of the literature and discussion among the authors (details can be found in appendix e-2).

To align categories of TN with the grading of diagnostic certainty that was introduced for neuropathic pain, we first defined criteria of possible, clinically, and etiologically established TN.

### Quality of life and symptomatology in neuropathic corneal pain in comparison with dry eye syndrome [^114QfjQ1]. Cornea (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is a complex pain syndrome that refers to corneal pain in response to stimuli that are normally considered nonpainful. Patients typically present with burning, aching, shooting, or stabbing pain without corresponding clinical signs, which are not alleviated through conventional dry eye treatment. This hyper-responsiveness and hyperalgesia caused by aberrant nerve regeneration that occurs alongside corneal nociceptors upregulation after nerve injury. Instead of sensitization and adaptation to prolonged stimulation, maladaptive plasticity occurs, leading to disinhibition and inappropriately sustained hyperexcitability. This often causes misdiagnosis of dry eye disease (DED). NCP occurs more frequently and are more severe in women. Psychological conditions (depression and anxiety), chronic pain states (fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia), neuropathies (diabetes or inflammatory neuropathy), and surgical interventions (refractive or corneal surgery) predispose patients to NCP. The symptoms of NCP cause physical, psychological, and functional impairment, leading to a reduction in quality of life (QoL)and incurring huge indirect and direct economic costs. The overall burden of neuropathic pain in the United States is approximately $200 billion per year. However, the economic burden of NCP alone has not yet been studied.

Refractory period

In most people with TN, a triggered attack is normally followed by a period of seconds or minutes during which further attacks cannot be provoked, a phenomenon called refractory period. This contrasts with the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, SUNHA, in which there is mostly no refractory period after exposure to a trigger.

Associated cranial autonomic symptoms

There are several case series of TN that describe cranial autonomic symptoms. This potentially poses a challenge differentiating TN from trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, which are characterised by prominent cranial autonomic symptoms. Rasmussen described 98 out of the 229 (43%) patients in whom the pain was accompanied by facial autonomic symptoms including lacrimation (31%), rhinorrhoea (9%), hypersalivation (7%) and facial swelling/flushing (5%). A recent Danish study reported that 48 of 158 patients (31%) experienced ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms during attacks. In both these series, these symptoms were more likely to be reported by patients with ophthalmic division trigeminal pain (V1). In contrast, Sjaastad et al carefully dissected the phenotype of 19 patients with V1 TN and reported the occurrence of lacrimation (42%), conjunctival injection (16%) and rhinorrhoea (11%), but the cranial autonomic symptoms were mild in all patients.

The series reporting TN with prominent cranial autonomic symptoms are in fact misdiagnosed cases of SUNHA; SUNHA is further subclassified as SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing) in patients with both conjunctival injection and lacrimation, or SUNA (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms) in patients with at least one cranial autonomic symptom but not both conjunctival injection and tearing. From a practical perspective, if a patient with a TN phenotype has only mild and sporadic cranial autonomic symptoms, then the diagnosis of TN can be maintained, whereas if these autonomic symptoms are intense (eg, profuse lacrimation and rhinorrhoea), numerous (> 1 of these symptoms) and consistently accompanying most attacks, then the patient should be diagnosed with SUNCT or SUNA. Other clinical features that can make a diagnosis of SUNHA more likely than TN in clinical practice include predominant pain in V1 trigeminal distribution, spontaneous-only attacks, absence of refractory period in triggered attacks and longer lasting attacks.

### SUNCT, SUNA and trigeminal neuralgia: different disorders or variants of the same disorder? [^114WCt4J]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic symptoms (SUNA) and trigeminal neuralgia are considered different disorders, thus grouped in separate sections of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 beta. However, the clinical, radiological and therapeutic overlap between SUNCT, SUNA, and trigeminal neuralgia has challenged this traditional view. This review summarizes the available clinical and pathophysiological evidence on whether SUNCT, SUNA and trigeminal neuralgia should be considered separate entities or variants of the same disorder.

Recent Findings

Data on the clinical phenotype and effective management strategies in SUNCT and SUNA syndromes have shown striking similarities with trigeminal neuralgia. Moreover, studies exploring radiological findings supported the hypothesis of common aetiological and pathophysiological basis between SUNCT/SUNA and trigeminal neuralgia. However, a limitation of most studies is that they have included small samples of patients and therefore any conclusions need to be drawn cautiously.

Summary

Despite being considered distinct conditions, emerging clinical and radiological evidence supports a broader nosological concept of SUNCT, SUNA, and trigeminal neuralgia. These conditions may constitute a continuum of the same disorder, rather than separate clinical entities. Further evidence is required to shed light on this nosological issue, given its potential impact on clinical practice and further research studies in this area.

### A mechanism-based classification of pain in multiple sclerosis [^1153PyPG]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) consists of paroxysmal attacks of electric-shock-like sensations that may develop spontaneously or be evoked by innocuous stimuli in specific facial or intraoral areas (trigger zones). By definition, typical TN is a pain syndrome that arises without a clinically manifest sensory deficit. TN is termed classic when investigation identifies no cause other than a neurovascular contact or symptomatic when secondary to major neurological disease. Symptomatic TN is frequently related to MS, patients with MS having a 20-fold increased risk of trigeminal neuralgia. About 2–5% of patients with MS have typical TN.

Multiple sclerosis-related TN has for long been attributed to a demyelinating plaque in the pons, as postmortem specimens indicate. The plaque theory nevertheless contrasts with the frequent neuroimaging finding of a neurovascular contact with the trigeminal root in patients with TN and MS and the existence of some patients with MS who have TN as the sole clinical manifestation; others therefore proposed that in most patients with MS, TN merely reflects the high frequency of neurovascular contacts in the normal population. Indeed, histopathological studies of surgical specimens describe demyelination in the proximal, centrally myelinated part of the trigeminal root in patients with MS-related TN and in those with classic TN. A clear-cut difference, however, is that trigeminal reflex testing is abnormal in 89% patients with MS-related TN, but in only 3% of patients with classic TN.

A recent neuroimaging-neurophysiological study in 130 patients with MS, 50 having typical TN, confirmed that in most patients TN was caused by a demyelinating plaque along the intra-axial primary afferents. Other findings in that study nevertheless showed that the TN-group differed from the other patients with MS, both those with trigeminal symptoms other than TN and those with no trigeminal involvement. Only the patients with TN showed the right-left asymmetry typically seen in classic TN and had symptom onset at an older age than MS patients without TN and younger age than patients with classic TN, suggesting that in patients with MS, some other mechanism contributes to the development of TN, probably a neurovascular contact, acknowledged as the most frequent cause of classic TN. These two pathogenetic mechanisms, MS plaque, and a neurovascular contact, would act on the same primary axons and both would produce demyelination. A dual mechanism involving MS and a neurovascular contact (Fig. 2) receives support from neurosurgical studies on the outcome of microvascular decompression because patients with MS-related TN, despite benefiting less than patients with classic TN, experienced considerable pain relief.

### Trigeminal neuralgia… [^114tMmyJ]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made using the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Definition Trigeminal neuralgia is a characteristic pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made on the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. It occurs in paroxysms, with each lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of paroxysms is highly variable, ranging from hundreds of attacks per day to long periods of remission that can last years. Between paroxysms, the person is asymptomatic.

The pain is severe and described as intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or shooting, often like an electric shock. It can be triggered by light touch in any area innervated by the trigeminal nerve, including from eating, talking, washing the face, or brushing the teeth. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression. In some persons, there remains a background pain of lower intensity for 50% of the time. This has been termed atypical trigeminal neuralgia or type 2 trigeminal neuralgia. The International Classification for Headache Disorders refers to this condition as trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain. Other causes of facial pain may need to be excluded. In trigeminal neuralgia, the neurologic examination is usually normal but sensory and autonomic symptoms may be reported, and persons with longer histories may demonstrate subtle sensory loss on careful examination.

A similar primary care study carried out in the Netherlands reported an incidence of 12. 6 per 100, 000 person-years when trained neurologists reviewed the data. A population-based study in Germany reported a lifetime prevalence of 0. 3%. Etiology and Risk Factors The cause of trigeminal neuralgia remains unclear, but the most common hypothesis is that of the ignition theory. More peripheral and central mechanisms may be involved, and trigeminal nerve microstructure may be altered. It is more common in persons with multiple sclerosis and stroke.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterised by recurrent, unilateral, brief (< 1 s–2 min), very painful, electric shock-like pain episodes in the trigeminal distribution that are abrupt in onset and termination.

It is a highly debilitating disorder that impacts on basic human functions such as talking, eating, drinking and touching the face, thereby resulting in a poor quality of life. Epidemiological studies show increased anxiety and depression, with increased risk of suicide. This highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis, investigations and treatment.

Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias

The trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are a group of headache disorders that are characterised by unilateral pain within the trigeminal innervation territory and are associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms and signs. These conditions include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). These conditions are all characterised by short-lasting pain, some localised in the facial region and some in the head, and accompanied by different autonomic features.

Cluster headache

The best known TAC condition is cluster headache. The first descriptions are variously accredited to van Swieten in 1745, Tulp in 1641 (22), and Harris in 1926 (5), but it was Horton who provided the first description of what was called Horton's histamine headache. Horton described a specific form characterised by headache, facial pain, tearing and running nose and swelling around the eye that could be induced by subcutaneous injection of histamine. A wide variety of names were subsequently used, probably for the same diagnosis, which included among others "ciliary neuralgia", "erythromelalgia of the head", "Sluder's neuralgia", "sphenopalatine neuralgia", and "migrainous neuralgia", but it was Kunkle et al. in 1952 who referred to it as a cluster headache.

SUNCT/SUNA

The first cases of SUNCT were described by Sjaastad in the late 1970s in a local journal, and three cases are described in 1989 by Sjaastad et al. Another condition termed SUNA, short neuralgiform headache with autonomic features, has been added as sometimes autonomic features other than conjunctival injection and tearing are noted. Interestingly, in 1903 Moore already wrote when describing the features of TN that "it may cause the eyes to water and the nose to discharge as well as result in redness in "the track" of the nerve".

Paroxysmal hemicrania

The fourth condition in this group is paroxysmal hemicrania, described as a chronic paroxysmal hemicrania responsive to indomethacin by Sjaastad and Dale in 1974. The condition of hemicrania continua was later described by Sjaastad and Spierings in 1984, in which the headache is continuous.

Trigeminal neuralgia — percutaneous Gasserian ganglion procedures (radiofrequency thermocoagulation [RFT], glycerol injection, balloon compression) demonstrate high early pain relief with declining durability and defined sensory risks: Ninety percent of patients attain pain relief from the procedures; at 1 year 68 to 85% are pain free, decreasing to 54 to 64% by 3 years, and at 5 years around 50% of patients undergoing RFT are still pain free. Sensory loss is present in almost half of patients, with less than 6% developing troublesome dysesthesias; the incidence of anesthesia dolorosa is around 4%; postoperative discomfort is reported by 12%; corneal numbness occurs in 4%; meningitis is mainly aseptic at 0.2%. Up to 50% of patients undergoing balloon compression suffer temporary and rarely chronic masticatory problems, and mortality is extremely low.

### Trigeminal neuralgia and facial nerve paralysis [^112FhjmD]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The trigeminal nerve is the largest of the cranial nerves. It provides sensory input from the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. The facial nerve is the cranial nerve with the longest extracranial course, and its main functions include motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression, sensory control of lacrimation and salivation, control of the stapedial reflex and to carry taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. In order to be able adequately to image and follow the course of these cranial nerves and their main branches, a detailed knowledge of neuroanatomy is required. As we are dealing with very small anatomic structures, high resolution dedicated imaging studies are required to pick up normal and pathologic nerves. Whereas CT is best suited to demonstrate bony neurovascular foramina and canals, MRI is preferred to directly visualize the nerve. It is also the single technique able to detect pathologic processes afflicting the nerve without causing considerable expansion such as is usually the case in certain inflammatory/infectious conditions, perineural spread of malignancies and in very small intrinsic tumours. Because a long course from the brainstem nuclei to the peripheral branches is seen, it is useful to subdivide the nerve in several segments and then tailor the imaging modality and the imaging study to that specific segment. This is particularly true in cases where topographic diagnosis can be used to locate a lesion in the course of these nerves.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112wtxDR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

TYPICAL PRESENTATIONS OF IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

The most common and 'classic' presentation of IIH is headache and papilledema (Fig. 1). Over 90% of IIH patients are affected by headache, which is the key determinant of morbidity in IIH. The features of headache in IIH vary substantially and frequently has a migraine phenotype. Although headaches can improve with reduction in ICP, more than half of IIH patients complain of persistent chronic headache despite normalization of ICP. Papilledema is an 'outstanding objective finding' of IIH and is the key diagnostic criterion in IIH, which also incorporates brain imaging to rule out secondary causes of raised ICP, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, and normal CSF constituents (Table 1). Visual symptoms that may accompany papilledema include transient visual obscurations, blurred vision, and double vision due to abducens nerve palsy. Other associated symptoms of IIH include dizziness, pulsatile tinnitus, and cognitive impairment.

FIGURE 1
The clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Typical IIH presents with headache (indicated by lines inside the head) and papilledema (indicated by enlarged eyes), often accompanied by other symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and normal neurological examination. This is the most common presentation (roughly indicated by size of head). A subset of patients with IIH are relatively asymptomatic or have mild IIH. These patients are often incidentally found to have papilledema and, compared with patients with typical IIH, have fewer headaches, less severe papilledema, and lower cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Patients with IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP) have a chronic refractory headache syndrome. It is unclear if IIHWOP represents a variant of IIH where ICP is not elevated enough for papilledema to develop or a separate disorder of intracranial hypertension. IIH can also present with highly asymmetric or unilateral papilledema and other cranial nerve manifestations, including ocular motor nerve palsies, trigeminal neuropathy or neuralgia, and facial nerve dysfunction. With chronic intracranial hypertension, osseous changes can occur in the skull base predisposing to spontaneous skull base CSF leak, which presents with CSF rhinorrhea and headache. Osseous changes can also lead to formation of temporal meningoceles and encephaloceles, potentially acting as a nidus for temporal lobe epilepsy.

### Ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in animal models with retinal inflammation via neuronal invasion following intranasal inoculation [^116xPHFS]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

A previous study has highlighted the neuro-tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested the need to identify the route of viral invasion into the brain. Olfactory nerves form bundles that provide an anatomical connection between the brain and nasal passage through the foramina in the cribriform plate and synapse on the glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. In addition, branches V 1 (ophthalmic) and V 2 (maxillary) of TN (Fig. 5c) innervate both the respiratory and olfactory regions of the nasal passage, connecting the brain. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission via the olfactory nerves have been demonstrated by several research groups, those of TN remains to be elucidated. Based on data obtained from a patient with COVID-19 who suffered from trigeminal neuralgia, neuronal invasion via TN has been suggested in humans. In this study, we demonstrated that TN can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and used for transmitting the virus to the brain and eyes, along with the ON.

### Objective assessment of autonomic signs during triggered first division trigeminal neuralgia [^114XGUoU]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

A total of 26 episodes of V-1 trigeminal neuralgia attacks have been recorded in two female patients. Autonomic phenomena were assessed according to a semiquantitative scale. Attacks lasted 17 ± 5 s. Mild lacrimation without conjunctival hyperaemia, rhinorrhea or ptosis was observed, even in relatively long lasting episodes. This is in clear contradiction with SUNCT (shortlasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection, tearing and rhinorrhea) attacks that are always dramatically accompanied by both lacrimation and conjunctival injection of the symptomatic side from the very onset of symptoms. Carbamazepine provided complete and sustained relief of symptoms in both patients. Herein we will show differential autonomic features of V-1 trigeminal neuralgia vs. SUNCT that will both aid the clinician to distinguish both syndromes and stress that both entities are nosologicaly different.

### Spatial-temporal signature of resting-state BOLD signals in classic trigeminal neuralgia [^1156iMS9]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Results from resting-state oscillations in typical frequency bands showed increases in ALFF in sensorimotor, multidimensional sensory processing, and interoceptive systems, as well as decreases in the default system, suggesting that the pathophysiologic basis of CTN involves the inclusion of sustained processing of noxious inputs and disruptions in modular segregation. The significant group differences identified in different sub-bands with greater brainstem findings in slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) and extensive bilateral preorbital frontal, right posterior parietal, and precuneus results in slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) support our hypothesis that trigeminal pain has a characteristic spatiotemporal resting state in the fMRI low-frequency BOLD signal properties. These findings might contribute to a better understanding of the impact of CTN on the brain's intrinsic architecture. Future research should take the frequencies into account when investigating the brain resting BOLD signals of patients with CTN.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^117B1nY4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms which last from a few seconds to 2 minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, gabapentin, lamotrigine, microvascular decompression, nerve block, oxcarbazepine, peripheral acupuncture, phenytoin, proparacaine eye drops, sodium valproate, stereotactic radiosurgery, tizanidine, and topiramate.

### Neuralgia and atypical facial, ear, and head pain [^113Ao8Pa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Though there have been considerable strides in the diagnosis and care of orofacial pain disorders, facial neuralgias, and myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome remain incredibly cumbersome for patients and difficult to manage for providers. Cranial neuralgias, myofascial pain syndromes, temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), dental pain, tumors, neurovascular pain, and psychiatric diseases can all present with similar symptoms. As a result, a patient's quest for the treatment of their orofacial pain often begins on the wrong foot, with a misdiagnosis or unnecessary procedure, which makes it all the more frustrating for them. Understanding the natural history, clinical presentation, and management of facial neuralgias and myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome can help clinicians better recognize and treat these conditions. In this article, we review updated knowledge on the pathophysiology, incidence, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and medical management of TN, GPN, GN, and MPDS.

### Trigeminal herpes zoster: early recognition and treatment are crucial [^111q4mA1]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) is not uncommon in older patients, particularly in cases of chronic autoimmune disorders and in patients taking immunosuppressant drugs. We present a case of a 57-year-old woman presenting with severe herpes zoster infection, involving the maxillary and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve. Despite an initial delay in instigating crucial antiviral treatment, the patient achieved an excellent recovery, with only some mild scarring at 2 months postinfection. Trigeminal herpes zoster is a potentially devastating clinical occurrence, and is associated with severe long-term neurological sequelae, including encephalitis, vision loss and postherpetic neuralgia. Physicians must be aware of risk factors and treatment modalities.

TN is characterised by recurrences and remissions.

Diagnosis and Imaging

TN is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, and as such, neuroimaging and laboratory tests are not mandatory to make a diagnosis. Patients with a characteristic history and a normal neurologic examination other than pain may be treated without further workup. However, modern workup of patients with TN usually includes elective imaging for all patients to exclude secondary causes of TN, such as inflammatory or mass lesions. As computer tomography (CT) is limited in evaluating the brain parenchyma, skull base nerves, and CSF cisterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution sequences at the skull base is usually the modality of choice. According to a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, routine head imaging identifies nonvascular, structural causes of TN in up to 15% of TN patients.

### Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias: diagnostic and therapeutic developments [^111WQP7h]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review was designed to summarize recent research relevant to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, which include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing/cranial autonomic features (SUNCT/SUNA). Hemicrania continua is included for completeness.

Recent Findings

Cluster headache has the longest attack duration and relatively low attack frequency. Paroxysmal hemicrania has intermediate duration and intermediate attack frequency. Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing have the shortest attack duration and the highest attack frequency. Hemicrania continua has a continuous pain with exacerbations that can include cranial autonomic symptoms as part of the phenotype. The importance of diagnosing these syndromes resides in their excellent but highly selective response to treatment.

Summary

Considerable advances have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and these are important for neurologists to consider.

Trigeminal neuralgia definition and incidence — population context: The International Association for the Study of Pain defines TN as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The annual incidence of TN is 4 to 5 in 100,000. The latest classification of the International Headache Society distinguishes between classic and symptomatic TN, and classic TN includes all cases without an established etiology (i.e., idiopathic), as well as those with potential vascular compression of the fifth cranial nerve.

DIAGNOSTIC GRADING SYSTEM FOR TN

Possible TN.

The minimum requirements for possible TN are pain distribution within the facial or intraoral territory of the trigeminal nerve and a paroxysmal character of pain (figure 1). The examining physician must ascertain that the pain does not extend to the posterior third of the scalp, the back of the ear, or the angle of the mandible, as these territories are innervated by cervical nerves (figure 2). The territory of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve reaches to the cranium; a patient with TN in the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve may therefore describe pain both in the lower lip and the temple. If the neuralgia involves 2 trigeminal divisions, they should be contiguous; a combination of the maxillary and mandibular divisions is most frequent. TN in the ophthalmic division or the tongue tends to be considered an indication of TN secondary to a major neurologic disease. However, this interpretation has not been adequately scrutinized. It is further important to note that both the affected division of the trigeminal nerve and the side of the face may change over the course of the disease.

Figure 1
New classification and diagnostic grading system for trigeminal neuralgia (TN)

a TN is typically a unilateral condition. Few patients develop TN on both sides of the face over the course of a disease, e.g. in multiple sclerosis, but they virtually never present with simultaneous bilateral pain. b The pain strictly follows the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. It does not extend to the posterior third of the scalp, the posterior part of the external ear, or the angle of the mandible (figure 2). c Paroxysmal pain is the main complaint, but it may be accompanied by continuous pain. d Trigger maneuvers include innocuous mechanical stimuli, facial or oral movements, or complex activities such as shaving or applying make-up. Confined trigger zones and a common combination with brisk muscle contractions (tics) help distinguish triggered TN from allodynia in other conditions of neuropathic pain. Trigger maneuvers may be tested by the examiner. e MRI readily identifies major neurologic diseases, such as tumors of the cerebellopontine angle or multiple sclerosis. Other investigations may include the neurophysiologic recording of trigeminal reflexes and trigeminal evoked potentials, which become necessary in patients who cannot undergo MRI. f Advanced MRI techniques are capable of demonstrating neurovascular compression with morphologic changes of the trigeminal nerve root.

Conclusions

Recent advances in TN have led to an improvement in its classification on the basis of the neuroimaging findings. Better understanding and description of other neuralgiform disorders such as SUNCT and SUNA have made the differential diagnosis clearer. Improved care pathways involving multidisciplinary teams and potentially new medications is resulting in improved outcomes for patients with TN.

Key points

Trigeminal neuralgia is currently classified into three subgroups: idiopathic, classical and secondary, based on imaging findings; MR brain imaging with trigeminal sequences is therefore essential in the diagnostic work-up.
An accurate diagnosis is crucial because the clinical management differs among the various forms of facial pain.
Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine remain the medications of choice; lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used as second-line treatments in monotherapy or polytherapy.
In pharmaco-resistant cases, trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia, whereas neuroablative surgical treatments and microvascular decompression can be considered in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
Pharmaco-resistant cases as well as cases where diagnosis is unclear should be referred to multidisciplinary facial pain teams led by neurologists specialising in headache disorders, where dedicated teams may confirm the diagnosis and offer advanced treatments.

Conclusions

This review broadly summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsants due to a long history of use and relatively tolerable side-effects. Patients who fail medical therapy have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerin or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with iatrogenic bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are otherwise ineligible for any type of invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo surgically invasive procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option — provided the patient is counseled ahead of time that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for a majority of patients in geographic locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

TN that is purely paroxysmal or with concomitant continuous pain

TN with concomitant continuous or near continuous pain occurs in 14%–50% of patients. The importance of differentiating these two subtypes is underlined by recent evidence suggesting that TN with concomitant continuous pain is pathophysiologically different (see the Pathophysiology section) and responds less well to treatments compared with the purely paroxysmal form.

Examination

The physical and neurological examinations are generally normal, though approximately 30% of cases can have sensory changes including mild hypoaesthesia. On rare occasions, during very severe attacks, the pain can evoke ipsilateral facial muscle contraction (tic douloureux).

Complications of radiosurgery for TN include facial hypesthesia, dysesthesia, keratitis/corneal damage due to loss of sensation, and dry eye. The median rates of hypesthesia are 19% for GK, 29% for LINAC, and 19% for CK. The onset of these complications may range from 1 to 94 months.

Although determining the best timing of radiosurgery after pain onset still requires further study, recent work has shown that undergoing GK earlier in the course of TN pain onset may lead to improved clinical outcomes and may reduce treatment with medication.

Premise Facial pain refers to a heterogeneous group of clinically and etiologically different conditions with the common clinical feature of pain in the facial area. Among these conditions, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), persistent idiopathic facial pain, temporomandibular joint pain, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are the most well described conditions. Conclusion TN has been known for centuries, and is recognised by its characteristic and almost pathognomonic clinical features. The other facial pain conditions are less well defined, and over the years there has been confusion about their classification.

Surgery timing in TN — patient surveys and evidence strength.

### Facial pain beyond trigeminal neuralgia [^114HHEbn]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Trigeminal neuralgia is a well-known facial pain syndrome with several treatment options. In contrast, non-neuralgiform idiopathic facial pain syndromes are relatively rare, reflected by the fact that, until 2020, no internationally accepted diagnostic classification existed. Like trigeminal neuralgia, these non-dental facial pain syndromes need to be managed by neurologists and pain specialists, but the lack of pathophysiological understanding has resulted in an underrepresented and undertreated patient group.

Recent Findings

This work provides a brief overview of the most common primary facial pain syndromes, namely, the facial attack-like facial pain, which corresponds to attack-like headache, the persistent idiopathic facial pain (formerly 'atypical facial pain'), and trigeminal neuropathy. What these disorders have in common is that they should all be treated conservatively.

Summary

On the basis of pragmatic classifications, permanent and attack-like primary facial pain can be relatively easily differentiated from one another. The introduction of the new International Classification of Orofacial Pain offers the opportunity to better coordinate and concentrate scientific efforts, so that in the future the therapy strategies that are still inadequate, can be optimized.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^112fJZyp]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an exemplary condition of neuropathic facial pain. However, formally classifying TN as neuropathic pain based on the grading system of the International Association for the Study of Pain is complicated by the requirement of objective signs confirming an underlying lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The latest version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders created similar difficulties by abandoning the term symptomatic TN for manifestations caused by major neurologic disease, such as tumors or multiple sclerosis. These diagnostic challenges hinder the triage of TN patients for therapy and clinical trials, and hamper the design of treatment guidelines. In response to these shortcomings, we have developed a classification of TN that aligns with the nosology of other neurologic disorders and neuropathic pain. We propose 3 diagnostic categories. Classical TN requires demonstration of morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerve root from vascular compression. Secondary TN is due to an identifiable underlying neurologic disease. TN of unknown etiology is labeled idiopathic. Diagnostic certainty is graded possible when pain paroxysms occur in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. Triggered paroxysms permit the designation of clinically established TN and probable neuropathic pain. Imaging and neurophysiologic tests that establish the etiology of classical or secondary TN determine definite neuropathic pain.

DISCUSSION

We have developed a new definition and diagnostic classification for TN (table), one that integrates an evaluation of diagnostic certainty based on criteria equivalent to those applied for neuropathic pain in general. The added assessment of diagnostic certainty will be helpful for treatment decisions. Diagnostic requirements for idiopathic, classical, and secondary TN are based on a thorough review of clinical and etiologic features of TN.

Table
Definition and classification of trigeminal neuralgia (TN)

Even after MRI or other investigation, the etiology of TN remains unclear (idiopathic) in approximately 11% of patients. Classical TN, caused by neurovascular compression, is the most frequent form of TN with defined etiology. Morphologic changes indicative of compression rather than mere vascular contact of the trigeminal root markedly increase the specificity of the diagnosis. Therapeutic relevance of these stricter criteria is supported by improved outcome of microvascular surgery in patients with clear signs of morphologic root alterations.MRI is the investigation of choice to detect trigeminal nerve compression. 3D reconstructions delineate the anatomic setting with high levels of sensitivity and specificity that help avoid unnecessary posterior fossa exploration. In about 15% of patients with TN, MRI reveals a major neurologic disease such as a benign tumor or MS. Secondary TN is a well-established term for the designation of these manifestations of neuralgia and should be maintained.

### Facial pain [^1158FBRs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are various cranial nerve lesions that cause complex presentations of headache and facial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and other rarer syndromes. Each present with their distinct patterns and diagnosis is reliant on a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic workup often involves neuroimaging modalities to rule out more common diseases. Treatment is aimed at symptomatic management, with conservative and pharmacologic therapies (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants) as primary treatment. Advanced procedures and surgical intervention are typically reserved for refractory cases.

Abstract

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been described in the literature as one of the most debilitating presentations of orofacial pain. This review summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the medical and surgical treatment of TN. Fundamentally, TN remains a clinical diagnosis that must be distinguished from other types of trigeminal neuropathic pain and/or facial pain associated with other neuralgias or headache syndromes. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsant medical therapy. Patients who fail this have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerol or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are ineligible for invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo open surgical procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option — provided the patient understands that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for patients in locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### Pain in the quiet (not red) eye [^113GG6zN]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although eye pain is often accompanied by redness or injection, pain can also occur with a quiet eye. Pain in a quiet eye can be the first sign of a vision-threatening condition, a more benign ophthalmologic condition, or a nonophthalmologic condition. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is an emergent vision-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment and referral to an ophthalmologist. Although most nonophthalmologic conditions that cause eye pain do not need immediate treatment, giant cell (temporal) arteritis requires urgent treatment with corticosteroids. Other vascular conditions, such as carotid artery disease, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and transient ischemic attack or stroke, rarely cause eye pain but must be considered. Pain may also be referred from the sinuses or from neurologic conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and increased intracranial pressure. The differential diagnosis of eye pain in the quiet eye is extensive, necessitating a systematic and thorough approach.

Differential diagnosis

TN is a clinical diagnosis based on detailed history and examination. Though often considered a straightforward diagnosis to make, its differential diagnosis can be challenging, given the considerable overlap with other neuropathic and neuralgiform headache and oro-facial pain disorders. Table 1 outlines the important differential diagnoses of TN.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia

We have discussed below some selected differential diagnoses in greater detail as they often pose a challenge in neurological clinical practice.

TN and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias

Since TN attacks are almost invariably precipitated by innocuous stimuli within the affected trigeminal distribution, all the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias except SUNCT/SUNA can be easily differentiated from TN as none of the others can be triggered by innocuous stimuli. Recent studies on the demographics and clinical phenotype of SUNCT and SUNA have highlighted a remarkable overlap with TN. Furthermore, a recent prospective cross-sectional MR study conducted in 159 patients with SUNCT and SUNA showed a significantly higher proportion of neurovascular contact with morphological changes on the symptomatic trigeminal nerves, compared with the asymptomatic nerves. The multivariate analysis of radiological predictors associated with the symptomatic side indicated that the presence of neurovascular contact with morphological changes was strongly associated with the side of the pain, suggesting that this finding may be a shared causative factor with TN. A recent large prospective open-label study conducted in 161 patients on the medical treatments of SUNCT/SUNA confirmed the efficacy of sodium channel blockers, indicating also a therapeutic overlap with TN. Taken together these pieces of evidence suggest that SUNCT, SUNA and TN may constitute a continuum of the same disorder. Given the challenges in differentiating between them, table 2 summarises the differences between TN and SUNCT/SUNA.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### Neuroimaging in trigeminal autonomic cephalgias: when, how, and of what? [^116xEGK4]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs) are characterized by frequent, short-lasting headache attacks with ipsilateral facial autonomic features. They include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing. The pathogenesis of TACs is largely unknown, but many case reports in the literature suggest that TACs are secondary to structural lesions. Thus, the question arises whether TAC patients should undergo neuroimaging. Here, we review the recent literature on secondary TACs and attempt to formulate guidelines for neuroimaging.

Recent Findings

Recently, we published two reviews of, in total, 33 case reports of patients with a secondary TAC or TAC-like syndrome. Since then, 23 additional cases have been published. Here, we provide a summary of these 56 case reports. TACs were found to be associated with a wide range of both intracranial and extracranial neurovascular and structural lesions. We could not identify a 'typical' clinical warning profile for secondary TACs as these patients could present with clinical features that are entirely characteristic of a TAC, including alternating attack and attack-free periods, and excellent response to TAC-specific treatments.

Summary

Even clinically typical TACs can be caused by structural lesions. There are no 'typical' warning signs or symptoms. Neuroimaging should be considered in all patients with TAC or TAC-like syndromes, notably in those with atypical presentation. Depending on the degree of suspicion, additional imaging should be considered assessing intracranial and cervical vasculature, and the sellar and paranasal region.

Which clinical or laboratory features accurately identify patients with symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. To distinguish symptomatic from classic trigeminal neuralgia, clinical characteristics such as patient age at onset, the presence of sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and unresponsiveness to treatment were examined. A younger age at onset and abnormal trigeminal nerve–evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. However, there is too much overlap in patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia to consider these clinical characteristics diagnostic for the latter. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves likely indicates symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia.

However, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features does not rule out symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. The involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and an unresponsiveness to treatment are not considered useful features for identifying patients with an increased risk of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. The literature is inconsistent about the accuracy of MRI in determining neurovascular compression in classic trigeminal neuralgia. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI in identifying vascular contact of the trigeminal nerve in classic trigeminal neuralgia, or to indicate the most reliable MRI technique. Baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective for controlling pain in patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia.

Use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics is probably ineffective for controlling pain in patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia. If the physician suspects symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia, more testing should be performed. Trigeminal reflex testing or MRI is a reasonable next step. However, given the relatively high diagnostic accuracy of abnormal trigeminal reflexes, MRI is probably unnecessary in the presence of normal trigeminal reflexes.
