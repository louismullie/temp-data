## Question

TXA to stop abnormal bleeding of nexplanon

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tranexamic acid (TXA) can stop abnormal bleeding associated with Nexplanon (etonogestrel implant) and, if so, how to use it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and mechanism of implant-related bleeding. Then, I should verify the direct evidence for TXA in implant users. Next, I will review indirect evidence and guideline recommendations. After that, I need to check dosing, safety, and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and counseling points, including alternatives and expectations about recurrence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Nexplanon commonly causes irregular bleeding due to progestin-mediated endometrial changes, including atrophy, dysregulated angiogenesis, and altered prostaglandin and matrix metalloproteinase activity; importantly, this is generally not harmful but can be bothersome and a leading reason for discontinuation, so I need to ensure counseling and shared decision-making are emphasized [^f20b2f60] [^32763577] [^7433018e].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence for TXA in implant users. The highest-quality data come from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Norplant (levonorgestrel implant) users showing that oral TXA 500 mg twice daily for 5 days significantly increased the proportion who stopped bleeding within 7 days (64.7% vs 35.3% with placebo; p = 0.015), but there was no sustained benefit in bleeding/spotting days over the subsequent 28 days, indicating a transient effect during treatment only [^cfdcca7f] [^73a3ab8a]. Hold on, I should confirm generalizability to Nexplanon; the 2024 CDC US Selected Practice Recommendations explicitly extrapolate this LNG implant evidence to etonogestrel implants and endorse short-course TXA as a reasonable option for bothersome bleeding, albeit with the caveat that bleeding is likely to recur after treatment ends [^de9cfdd7] [^56898878] [^a8241e57].

> I need to check indirect evidence and guideline positioning. TXA is effective for heavy menstrual bleeding across multiple etiologies, with Cochrane data showing reduced menstrual blood loss and higher improvement rates versus placebo and NSAIDs, and ACOG includes TXA among first-line medical options for acute abnormal uterine bleeding; however, these data are not implant-specific, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize long-term effects in implant users [^f4a70dcd] [^0bdfb492] [^f98a1aff]. But wait, what if the patient is using an IUD rather than an implant? I should double-check that distinction: TXA has not shown benefit for LNG-IUD nuisance bleeding in RCTs, so I must not conflate IUD and implant data when counseling [^d31501c4] [^cb0f1c75].

> Next, I should review dosing and administration. The RCT regimen that worked was 500 mg orally twice daily for 5 days; I initially thought the standard AUB dose of 1.3 g three times daily might apply, but hold on, I should verify — that higher-dose regimen is FDA-labeled for cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding and is not the regimen studied for implant-related irregular bleeding, so I should stick with 500 mg BID for 5 days in this context [^cfdcca7f] [^98a0a698] [^3b9e3e85]. Let me reconsider: if bleeding is very heavy or refractory, some clinicians adapt the 1.3 g TID dose from AUB labeling, but for implant-related irregular bleeding the evidence base supports 500 mg BID for 5 days, and repeating as needed if bleeding recurs [^98a0a698] [^a8241e57].

> I should confirm safety and contraindications. TXA is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects are gastrointestinal and mild, and large obstetric datasets show no increased thromboembolic risk with short-course use, though a historical cohort suggested a very small absolute VTE risk with oral TXA that is not clinically meaningful for short menstrual use; nonetheless, I need to screen for active or historical venous or arterial thromboembolism, intrinsic thrombotic risk, or active thromboembolic disease, and avoid use in those settings [^0ceb0aa8] [^1cab0d5c] [^14309747]. Hold on, I should verify labeling nuances: some labels list combined hormonal contraception as a contraindication with TXA due to theoretical thrombosis risk, but clinical guidance allows cautious coadministration when clinically indicated; in implant users, there is no estrogen exposure, which removes that specific concern, though standard VTE screening still applies [^152fd3da] [^11bad3c9].

> Let me synthesize the clinical recommendation. Yes, TXA can stop an episode of abnormal bleeding associated with Nexplanon, but the effect is transient and limited to the treatment window. A 5-day course of oral TXA 500 mg twice daily increases the likelihood of stopping bleeding within a week, and treatment can be repeated as needed, with counseling that bleeding often recurs after cessation and that long-term control may require alternative strategies or method change if unacceptable [^de9cfdd7] [^56898878] [^a8241e57]. I should confirm that this aligns with patient-centered care: explore goals (continue implant vs remove), evaluate for underlying pathology if indicated, and offer alternatives such as short-course NSAIDs or supplemental estrogen, noting that NSAIDs may have more durable effects after treatment ends in some users, though evidence quality varies [^27202c96] [^c175fd26] [^4cc7408a].

> I will now examine practical counseling and follow-up. Before prescribing, I need to ensure pregnancy is excluded, screen for thrombotic risk, and review medications that interact with TXA. Counsel on expected timing of effect, possible GI upset, and the need to repeat treatment if bleeding recurs. If bleeding remains heavy or persistent despite appropriate therapy, I should reassess for structural or endocrine causes and reconsider contraceptive method, as irregular bleeding is a leading reason for implant discontinuation and method satisfaction improves with anticipatory guidance [^f20b2f60] [^7433018e] [^27202c96]. Hold on, I should verify that patients understand recurrence is expected; the CDC explicitly notes bleeding is likely to recur after TXA cessation, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making about ongoing management and method continuation [^a8241e57].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and safety netting. Record the indication, dose, duration, and counseling points. Advise prompt contact for heavy bleeding with hemodynamic symptoms, severe pain, or new focal symptoms. And if the patient ultimately desires removal, arrange timely extraction and provide alternative contraception to avoid a gap in protection, consistent with best practices for implant management and counseling [^27202c96] [^c382dbb7].

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is effective for **short-term control** of abnormal bleeding with Nexplanon, with 500 mg orally twice daily for 5 days increasing the likelihood of stopping bleeding within 7 days [^de9cfdd7] [^73a3ab8a]. However, **bleeding often recurs** after stopping TXA, so it is best used intermittently rather than as a long-term solution [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26]. TXA is safe for most patients, but avoid in those with a history of thromboembolism or active clotting disorders [^14309747] [^152fd3da]. If bleeding persists or is severe, evaluate for other causes and consider alternative therapies or device removal [^27202c96] [^f20b2f60].

---

## Mechanism of action

TXA is an antifibrinolytic that **inhibits plasminogen activation**, reducing fibrinolysis and stabilizing clots, which helps control bleeding without hormonal effects [^b3cd0a45].

---

## Clinical evidence for TXA in nexplanon-related bleeding

Evidence for TXA in **etonogestrel implant users** is limited; most data come from levonorgestrel implant studies, which show short-term benefit [^de9cfdd7] [^56898878]. In a randomized trial of LNG implant users, 500 mg twice daily for 5 days increased the proportion stopping bleeding within 7 days (64.7% vs 35.3% with placebo; p = 0.015) [^73a3ab8a]. However, there was **no sustained reduction** in bleeding/spotting days after treatment ended, indicating transient benefit [^de9cfdd7] [^4ab6eccc].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

The **recommended regimen** is 500 mg orally twice daily for 5 days; this can be repeated as needed if bleeding recurs [^de9cfdd7] [^c175fd26].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

TXA is generally safe, but the following precautions apply:

- **Contraindications**: Active thromboembolic disease, history of thrombosis, or intrinsic thrombotic risk [^14309747] [^152fd3da].
- **Caution**: Use with combined hormonal contraceptives due to theoretical thrombosis risk, though evidence is limited [^152fd3da] [^11bad3c9].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, headache, dizziness, and rare thromboembolic events [^14309747] [^f4a70dcd].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Duration of effect** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tranexamic acid | Short-term control | Transient; bleeding recurs | Repeat as needed [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26] |
| NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) | Variable | Short-term | Repeat as needed [^c175fd26] [^4cc7408a] |
| Combined oral contraceptives | Effective | Short-term | Repeat as needed [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26] |
| SERMs (e.g. tamoxifen) | Limited evidence | Short-term | Repeat as needed [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

CDC 2024 recommends TXA as a **short-term option** for implant-related bleeding, with counseling that bleeding often recurs and treatment can be repeated as needed [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26]. ACOG supports TXA for acute abnormal uterine bleeding, including progestin-only method users, when no contraindications exist [^0bdfb492] [^f98a1aff].

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Expectations**: TXA provides short-term control; bleeding may recur after stopping [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26].
- **Repeat use**: Treatment can be repeated as needed [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26].
- **Safety**: Review contraindications and monitor for adverse effects [^14309747] [^152fd3da].
- **Persistent bleeding**: Evaluate for other causes if bleeding continues or is severe [^27202c96] [^f20b2f60].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

TXA is a **reasonable short-term option** for Nexplanon-related bleeding, with 500 mg twice daily for 5 days providing transient control; it can be repeated as needed. It does not address the underlying hormonal mechanism, so bleeding often recurs. For persistent or severe bleeding, reassess for other causes and consider alternative therapies or device removal [^a8241e57] [^c175fd26].

2 MEDICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS

2.1 Tranexamic acid

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a suitable option for the management of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. TXA is a synthetic lysine‐analog antifibrinolyticand therefore not a causal therapy for uterine fibroids. By inhibiting fibrinolysis, it helps to manage the bleeding but does not affect the size of the fibroids.

TXA has shown an average reduction of 89 mL in menstrual bleeding in patients with uterine fibroids. In patients with heavy menstrual bleeding, a 40%–50% reduction in bleeding has been described.TXA appears effective for treating heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, oral luteal progestogens, ethamsylate, or herbal remedies, but may be less effective than levonorgestrel intrauterine systems. Intravenous infusion of TXA in the intraoperative period of large myomectomies showed no significant difference compared with placebo.

TXA can be administered intravenously or orally during menstruation.

Adverse events associated with TXA are gastrointestinal adverse effects, abdominal discomfort, headaches, dizziness, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, weight changes, and mood swings. No thromboembolic events have been reported with TXA use. The contraindications, apart from a known allergy to TXA, are history of venous or arterial thromboembolism or active thromboembolic disease.

2.2 Progestins

### ACOG committee opinion no. 557: management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women [^f98a1aff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with acute abnormal uterine bleeding should include a prompt assessment for signs of hypovolemia and potential hemodynamic instability. After initial assessment and stabilization, the etiologies of acute abnormal uterine bleeding should be classified using the PALM-COEIN system. Medical management should be the initial treatment for most patients, if clinically appropriate. Options include intravenous conjugated equine estrogen, multi-dose regimens of combined oral contraceptives or oral progestins, and tranexamic acid. Decisions should be based on the patient's medical history and contraindications to therapies. Surgical management should be considered for patients who are not clinically stable, are not suitable for medical management, or have failed to respond appropriately to medical management. The choice of surgical management should be based on the patient's underlying medical conditions, underlying pathology, and desire for future fertility. Once the acute bleeding episode has been controlled, transitioning the patient to long-term maintenance therapy is recommended.

### Therapeutic options for unscheduled bleeding associated with long-acting reversible contraception [^deb467d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is the most effective form of reversible contraception. Although most women are satisfied with LARC methods, unscheduled bleeding and spotting are common reasons for method dissatisfaction and discontinuation. This systematic analysis of the current literature delineates treatment options for unscheduled bleeding related to LARC use. Although consistent results are lacking, all devices seem to have the best response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for 5 to 7 days or the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid. Additional studies are necessary to identify improved treatment interventions for unscheduled bleeding with LARC use.

### The medical management of abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-aged women [^d41d84aa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

In the treatment of women with abnormal uterine bleeding, once a thorough history, physical examination, and indicated imaging studies are performed and all significant structural causes are excluded, medical management is the first-line approach. Determining the acuity of the bleeding, the patient's medical history, assessing risk factors, and establishing a diagnosis will individualize their medical regimen. In acute abnormal uterine bleeding with a normal uterus, parenteral estrogen, a multidose combined oral contraceptive regimen, a multidose progestin-only regimen, and tranexamic acid are all viable options, given the appropriate clinical scenario. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be treated with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptives, continuous oral progestins, and tranexamic acid with high efficacy. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be utilized with hormonal methods and tranexamic acid to decrease menstrual bleeding. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are indicated in patients with leiomyoma and abnormal uterine bleeding in preparation for surgical interventions. In women with inherited bleeding disorders all hormonal methods as well as tranexamic acid can be used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women on anticoagulation therapy should consider using progestin-only methods as well as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist to treat their heavy menstrual bleeding. Given these myriad options for medical treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, many patients may avoid surgical intervention.

Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) — counseling and management of bleeding include that during contraceptive counseling and before placement, information about spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed, and approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use; if the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired. For treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs, RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA observed no differences between treatment and placebo groups in bleeding over 90 days, and a prospective cohort reported that 68% of participants experienced side effects.

### How I treat heavy menstrual bleeding associated with anticoagulants [^2d9901fa]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an underrecognized but not uncommon problem in clinical practice. Premenopausal women should be advised of the potential effect of anticoagulant therapy on menstrual bleeding at the time of treatment initiation. Consequences of HMB should be assessed and treated on an ongoing basis. In the acute setting, the decision to withhold anticoagulants is based on an individual patient's risk of thrombosis and the severity of the bleeding. For women who require long-term anticoagulation, a levonorgestrel intrauterine system, tranexamic acid (during menstrual flow), high-dose progestin-only therapy, or combined hormonal contraceptives are effective for controlling HMB. The risk of thrombosis during anticoagulant therapy with these treatments is not well studied but is likely to be low. Selection of type of hormonal therapy is based on patient preference, other indications for and contraindications to therapy, adverse effect profile, and ongoing thrombotic risk factors. Women who do not respond to medical treatment or who do not wish to retain their fertility should be considered for surgical management.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^27202c96]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Contraceptive implant — bleeding irregularities (spotting, light bleeding, heavy or prolonged bleeding) management emphasizes preplacement counseling, evaluation for underlying conditions when clinically indicated, patient-centered goal setting, and optional treatments. Before implant placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during implant use, noting that spotting or light bleeding is common, amenorrhea can occur, changes are generally not harmful but might be bothersome, and heavy bleeding is uncommon. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions and treat or refer if found. Explore patient goals, including continued implant use with reassurance and access to discuss side effects, or implant removal; if the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired. If the patient wants treatment, options may be considered based on preferences and history: hormonal treatment (e.g., 20–30 μg EE COCs or estrogen), antifibrinolytic agents (e.g., tranexamic acid), 5 days, NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), 5–7 days, and SERMs (e.g., tamoxifen), 7–10 days; treatments might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use, bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation, some effects might persist for some time after cessation, and treatment may be repeated as needed.

Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) During Implant Use

Before implant placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during implant use. Spotting or light bleeding is common with implant use, and certain implant users experience amenorrhea. These bleeding changes are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding changes might or might not decrease with continued implant use. Heavy bleeding is uncommon during implant use.

Bleeding Irregularities (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued implant use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or implant removal. If the patient wants to continue implant use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use; bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. Hormonal treatment (e.g. 20–30 µ g EE COCs or estrogen) Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. tranexamic acid), 5 days º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use and whose effects might persist for some time after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. NSAIDs (e.g. celecoxib, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), 5–7 days SERMs (e.g. tamoxifen), 7–10 days

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^ff469220]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) — bleeding irregularities and management: During contraceptive counseling before placement, discuss spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, and note that approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome. Enhanced counseling and reassurance have been reported to reduce method discontinuation with other hormonal contraceptives. If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD and counsel on alternative methods and initiate another method if desired. For treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs, RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA observed no differences versus placebo in bleeding outcomes over 90 days, whereas a prospective cohort with a 3-month treatment found a significant reduction in bleeding days after 90 days but 68% of patients experienced side effects.

### Oral contraception and menstrual bleeding during treatment of venous thromboembolism: expert opinion versus current practice: combined results of a systematic review, expert panel opinion and an international survey [^fd9c6827]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal management of oral contraception and menstrual bleeding during treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is largely unknown. We aimed to elicit expert opinion and compare that to current practice as assessed by a world-wide international web-based survey among physicians.

Methods

10 international thrombosis experts and 10 abnormal uterine bleeding experts independently completed a questionnaire containing three hypothetical patient cases each with four different scenarios, and additional queries covering different severities of VTE, patient circumstances, hormonal contraceptives and both thrombotic and bleeding complications. The consensus percentage was set a priori at ≥ 70%. The same questionnaire with randomized case scenarios was presented to international physicians via newsletters of the ISTH and national scientific communities. Differences between the expert groups and daily clinical care were assessed.

Results

Expert recommendations were divergent and differed in several important points from clinical practice. In contrast to common practice in which contraceptives are discontinued at the moment of a VTE diagnosis, the thrombosis experts agreed to continue oral contraception (OC) during the anticoagulation treatment period. Also, experts reached consensus on treating patients with anticoagulation-associated abnormal uterine bleeding with tranexamic acid, although this is not supported by strong evidence from the literature. No consensus was reached on the optimal anticoagulant drug class.

Conclusions

International experts' opinions on handling of contraceptives and management of anticoagulant-associated abnormal uterine bleeding in female VTE patients are divergent and management in clinical practice is heterogeneous. There is a great need of further studies on these topics.

### IV tranexamic acid prior to hysterectomy… [^9855b82d]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Additionally, risk of death due to bleeding was significantly lower in those receiving tranexamic acid. No differences in risk of vascular occlusive events were noted. Further analysis revealed reduced risk of death from bleeding if TXA was given within 3 hours of injury; treatment administered after 3 hours from injury increased the risk of death due to bleeding. The utility of TXA appears to extend to obstetric hemorrhage. Several published studies exist analyzing its use in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage, though the drug is not considered standard for prevention or treatment of this condition. A pilot randomized open-label trial of IV TXA in women with postpartum hemorrhage over 800cc reported a lower median blood loss between groups, though the effect was modest. Additionally, significantly fewer women in the TXA group required transfusion or invasive procedures.

A recent Cochrane review reports on twelve trials of low risk women undergoing cesarean section or spontaneous birth who received uterotonics with or without the addition of TXA. TXA was effective in decreasing estimated blood loss over 1 liter in women undergoing cesarean section. Mean blood loss was significantly lower in women receiving TXA; effect was similar for women undergoing cesarean section and vaginal birth. Finally, the WOMAN trial is a large, ongoing, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of early TXA administration in clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage. The use of TXA in the management of acute and abnormal uterine bleeding has been reported, and is FDA-approved for treatment of menorrhagia. One randomized study of oral TXA in the treatment of ovulatory menorrhagia reported a 45% decrease in mean menstrual blood loss with use of TXA as compared with placebo.

Other studies have echoed these findings, with TXA more effective than NSAIDs but less effective than the levonorgestrel intrauterine device in decreasing menstrual blood loss. More recently, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial confirmed a significant decrease in menstrual blood loss, improvements in social/physical limitations caused by menorrhagia and self-perceived menstrual blood loss. No data exist examining the efficacy of IV TXA in the management of acute or severe uterine bleeding.

Bleeding Irregularities (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued implant use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or implant removal. If the patient wants to continue implant use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: * º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use; bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. * Hormonal treatment (e.g. 20–30 µ g ethinyl estradiol [EE] combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or estrogen) * Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. tranexamic acid), 5 days * º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use and whose effects might persist for some time after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. celecoxib, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), 5–7 days * Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. tamoxifen), 7–10 days *

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. º If the patient desires implant removal, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Tranexamic acid with or without combined oral contraceptives in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding — mechanism and thrombotic risk: Tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis, and although there is a theoretical risk of thrombosis, the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid and OCs has been used when monotherapy has failed; review of the existing literature has not identified an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in this setting, although studies are very limited. It is an important treatment option to control bleeding in this population and a reasonable approach to management when other options have failed.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^b58929b5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients seeking care for bleeding irregularities while using an implant, it is important to explore patient goals, including removal of the implant, treatment for bleeding irregularities, or continued use of the implant without treatment. Irregular bleeding during contraceptive implant use might be caused by several mechanisms, including an atrophic endometrium, dysregulated angiogenesis, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, or increased expression of prostaglandin metabolites. Multiple treatments have been evaluated to manage irregular bleeding with implant use, which have different proposed mechanisms of action and likely different effects.

NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin levels and might reduce menstrual blood loss.
Estrogen alone or estrogen-containing contraception has been used to help stabilize the endometrium and was initially proposed as bleeding episodes in LNG implant users were associated with low serum estradiol levels.
SERMs and selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) (e.g. tamoxifen, mifepristone, and UPA) might modulate endometrial angiogenesis and endometrial proliferation (,–).
Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent.
Doxycycline has been investigated because of its ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases.
Certain treatments, such as estrogen alone or estrogen-containing contraception, likely work to decrease bleeding primarily during treatment use, whereas other drugs, such as NSAIDs, SERMs, and SPRMs, might have effects that continue after treatment is completed.
Evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with ENG implant use. Therefore, this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider rather than specific regimens.

### Treatment of vaginal bleeding irregularities induced by progestin only contraceptives [^484ce864]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite their high effectiveness, progestin-only contraceptives are considered less than ideal by the many women who experience irregular vaginal bleeding when using them. Current treatments to control these bleeding problems are not sufficiently effective.

Objectives

We evaluated preventive and therapeutic approaches to normalise bleeding irregularities associated with the use of progestin-only contraceptives.

Search Methods

Literature was identified through database searches, reference lists, organisations and individuals, covering the period until May-June 2012.

Selection Criteria

Trials with random or systematic allocation, testing interventions for the prevention or treatment of bleeding irregularities associated with the use of progestin-only contraceptives were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results are expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for categorical data and as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI for continuous data. When we encountered heterogeneity (visual or statistical) we used the random-effects model (quantitative) or did not produce a summary estimate (qualitative).

Main Results

Thirty-three randomised controlled trials enrolling 3677 participants were included. Two thirds of the trials were determined to reflect low to moderate risk of bias. Estrogen treatments reduced the number of days of an ongoing bleeding episode in DMPA and Norplant users. However, treatment frequently led to more discontinuation due to gastrointestinal upset. Combinations of oral ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel improved bleeding patterns in Norplant users, but method discontinuation rates were unchanged. One trial reported successful use of combined oral contraceptives in treating amenorrhea among DMPA users. Norplant users, but not Implanon users, administered the anti-progestin mifepristone reported fewer days of bleeding during treatment than those given placebo. Mifepristone used monthly by new Norplant acceptors reduced bleeding, when compared to placebo. A variety of NSAIDS have been evaluated for their ability to treat abnormal bleeding, with mixed results. Norplant users receiving SERM (tamoxifen) had less unacceptable bleeding after treatment and were more likely to continue using Norplant than those receiving placebo. Tranexamic acid, mifepristone combined with an estrogen and doxycycline were more effective than placebo in terminating an episode of bleeding in women using progestin-only contraceptives, according to three small studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Some women may benefit from the interventions described, particularly with cessation of current bleeding. Several regimens offer promise in regulating bleeding, but findings need to be reproduced in larger trials. The results of this review do not support routine clinical use of any of the regimens included in the trials, particularly for long-term effect.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^b3cd0a45]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. In particular, renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in a variety of medical and surgical conditions at increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is currently considered a mainstay of Patient Blood Management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in a number of globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and post-partum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^533a3a88]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Abortion-related hemorrhage — secondary treatment and antifibrinolytic use — When bleeding is excessive or refractory to massage and uterotonics, the clinician should move quickly to secondary treatment measures, and the following measures should be instituted without delay: placement of additional intravenous lines, fluid resuscitation, and laboratory assessment (including hemoglobin, coagulation parameters, and cross-match). In suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), administration of fibrinogen concentrate is an acceptable first step even without laboratory evidence, and transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate can also be initiated without laboratory evidence of DIC. Tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis and stabilizes blood clots; while the guideline does not find sufficient evidence to recommend for or against TXA in abortion hemorrhage, given postpartum data, we suggest it as a safe and effective agent for prophylaxis and treatment for hemorrhage at the time of abortion (GRADE 2C). TXA is commonly administered intravenously as 1000 mg either 30 minutes before the procedure, and it can also be administered intramuscularly.

### Pharmacological therapy for abnormal uterine bleeding [^02de7e98]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapies for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding are effective and generally well tolerated. This review presents an evidence-based approach to medical therapy. Selection depends on the etiology and amount of bleeding, need for contraception or preservation of fertility, perimenopause status, and medication efficacy and adverse effects. Available nonhormonal agents include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, which reduce bleeding by 25% to 35% and improve dysmenorrhea through reduced prostaglandin levels; tranexamic acid, which inhibits plasminogen activator with a 40% to 60% reduction in menstrual blood loss; and intranasal desmopressin, which is an antifibrinolytic for women with an underlying bleeding disorder (eg, von Willebrand disease). Hormonal regimens cause the inhibition of endometrial growth. Cyclic progestogen therapy for 21 days results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss. Limited data suggest that oral contraceptives reduce menstrual blood loss by 40% to 50% with decreased breast tenderness and dysmenorrhea and a reduction in risk of uterine and ovarian cancer. The progestin-releasing intrauterine devices are effective up to 97% by 6 months and provide relief of dysmenorrhea and contraception. Long-acting progestogen injections produce amenorrhea and provide contraception but are associated with irregular spotting and reversible bone loss. Danazol leads to endometrial atrophy with a reduced menstrual loss; androgenic adverse effects may be lessened with lower doses or vaginal use. Gonadotrophin agonists lead to ovarian suppression and are used to shrink fibroids or the endometrium preoperatively but are limited by hypoestrogenic adverse events. Emergency use of parenteral conjugated estrogens has a 70% chance of stopping abnormal bleeding but an increased risk of thrombosis.

### Practice bulletin no. 186 summary: long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^cb0f1c75]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (IUDs) — bleeding management and heavy menstrual bleeding treatment indicate that lower-dose levonorgestrel IUDs have more bleeding or spotting days than the higher-dose LNG-20 IUD, although overall patterns are similar and well tolerated. Evidence supports treating bleeding and spotting associated with LNG-IUD use with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications; in a randomized trial, naproxen significantly reduced bleeding and spotting days in the first 12 weeks of LNG-20 IUD use, whereas transdermal estradiol significantly increased bleeding and spotting, but tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid did not alleviate nuisance bleeding during the first 90 days of LNG-20 IUD use. The LNG-20 IUD is FDA-approved for the treatment of heavy bleeding, with a review of 18 studies reporting a menstrual blood loss reduction of 79–97%. The number of bleeding or spotting days may be increased relative to baseline during the first year of use, and the LNG-20 IUD is more effective than oral medications for treating heavy menstrual bleeding.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^0dd65d41]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the efficacy of TXA in various conditions at potential risk of severe bleeding, several groups also evaluated its use in preventing obstetric hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of premature maternal mortality globally, accounting for at least 100,000 deaths each year worldwide. A Cochrane systematic review that evaluated TXA in the prevention of PPH was recently published. In the frame of an analysis of 12 RCT involving 3,285 women, TXA decreased postpartum blood loss, prevented PPH and lowered blood transfusion requirements. We have recently conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of TXA for PPH prevention in women undergoing Cesarean delivery. After an in-depth analysis of 18 RCT involving 4,557 women, it was found that prophylactic use of TXA significantly reduced the incidence of PPH, total blood loss and transfusion requirements without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications, thus supporting its beneficial effect in this critical clinical setting. Accordingly, the most recent multidisciplinary consensus statement on prevention and treatment of PPH from the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis (NATA) recommends intravenous of TXA for women at increased risk of PPH (grade 1C recommendation).

On the whole, these multiple and consistent findings show that TXA is effective at preventing bleeding complications in a variety of medical and surgical conditions without increasing the risk of thrombosis.

Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen use among LNG implant users demonstrated inconsistent effects. One trial did not demonstrate any significant differences in the number of bleeding and spotting days after a course of ibuprofen (800 mg) twice daily for 5 days compared with placebo.

No trials investigated ibuprofen use among ENG implant users (Certainty of evidence: very low to low).

Antifibrinolytic agents. Tranexamic acid: Tranexamic acid (500 mg) twice daily for 5 days among LNG implant users increased the percentage of those who stopped bleeding within 7 days of treatment initiation compared with placebo. However, there was no difference in bleeding and spotting days after treatment cessation in the 28-day follow-up period between those using tranexamic acid and those using placebo. No trials investigated tranexamic acid among ENG implant users (Certainty of evidence: high).

The following adverse reactions reported with the use of hormonal contraception are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Changes in Menstrual Bleeding Patterns [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Ectopic Pregnancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Liver Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions.

In clinical trials involving 942 women who were evaluated for safety, change in menstrual bleeding patterns (irregular menses) was the most common adverse reaction causing discontinuation of use of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant (IMPLANON) (11.1% of women).

Adverse reactions that resulted in a rate of discontinuation of ≥ 1% are shown in Table 3.

Other adverse reactions that were reported by at least 5% of subjects in the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant clinical trials are listed in Table 4.

In a clinical trial of NEXPLANON, in which investigators were asked to examine the implant site after insertion, implant site reactions were reported in 8.6% of women. Erythema was the most frequent implant site complication, reported during or shortly after insertion, occurring in 3.3% of subjects. Additionally, hematoma (3.0%), bruising (2.0%), pain (1.0%), and swelling (0.7%) were reported.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^caf12293]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of combined estrogen-progestin medications by patients at increased risk of thrombosis is controversial. Estrogen has been shown to have a dose-dependent thrombotic risk, with the highest thrombotic risk in patients treated with 50μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel and the lowest in 20–30μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel. A Cochrane meta-analysis on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk associated with different combined oral contraceptives among women who were not anticoagulated found that when compared to levonorgestrel, other progestins' pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval, CI) of VTE was 1.33 (1.08–1.63) for gestodene, 1.93 (1.31–2.83) for desogestrel, and 1.67 (1.10–2.55) for drospirenone. A prior systematic review also found that levonorgestrel was associated with lower thrombotic risk compared to other progestins: relative risk of VTE (95% CI) of ethinylestradiol with progestins in patients taking combined oral contraceptives versus non-users was 2.9 (2.2–3.8) for levonorgestrel, 6.6 (5.6–7.8) for desogestrel, and 6.4 (5.4–7.5) for drospirenone.

Tranexamic acid is another option for managing heavy menses, which has been available without a prescription in Scandinavia for decades. For women at risk of recurrent thrombosis, however, the safety of this medication remains controversial. One large historical prospective cohort study showed an increased incidence of VTE in women of reproductive age treated with tranexamic acid (without anticoagulation) compared to those not treated, though this small increase in VTE risk is not clinically significant for use during menstruation alone (number needed to harm per 5 days of treatment was 78,549 persons). A meta-analysis of a more general, non-surgical patient population treated with tranexamic acid for indications including but not limited to menstrual bleeding demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality without increased venous or arterial thrombotic complications. While further studies that control for indication for anticoagulation are needed, many clinicians cautiously recommend tranexamic acid to control troublesome menstrual bleeding in women treated with anticoagulation.

Step 6.	The tip of the implant should pop out of the incision. If it does not, gently push the implant towards the incision until the tip is visible. Grasp the implant with forceps and, if possible, remove the implant (Figure 13). If needed, gently remove adherent tissue from the tip of the implant using blunt dissection. If the implant tip is not exposed following blunt dissection, make an incision into the tissue sheath and then remove the implant with the forceps (Figures 14 and 15).

Step 7.	If the tip of the implant does not become visible in the incision, insert forceps (preferably curved mosquito forceps, with the tips pointed up) superficially into the incision (Figure 16). Gently grasp the implant and then flip the forceps over into your other hand (Figure 17).

Step 8. With a second pair of forceps carefully dissect the tissue around the implant and grasp the implant (Figure 18). The implant can then be removed. If the implant cannot be grasped, stop the procedure and refer the woman to a healthcare professional experienced with complex removals or call 1-844-674-3200.

Step 9. Confirm that the entire implant, which is 4 cm long, has been removed by measuring its length. There have been reports of broken implants while in the patient's arm. In some cases, difficult removal of the broken implant has been reported. If a partial implant (less than 4 cm) is removed, the remaining piece should be removed by following the instructions in section 2.3. If the woman would like to continue using NEXPLANON, a new implant may be inserted immediately after the old implant is removed using the same incision as long as the site is in the correct location [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Step 10. After removing the implant, close the incision with a sterile adhesive wound closure.

Step 11. Apply a pressure bandage with sterile gauze to minimize bruising. The woman may remove the pressure bandage in 24 hours and the sterile adhesive wound closure in 3 to 5 days.

### Nonsurgical management of heavy menstrual bleeding: a systematic review [^63512022]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of nonsurgical abnormal uterine bleeding treatments for bleeding control, quality of life (QOL), pain, sexual health, patient satisfaction, additional treatments needed, and adverse events.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane databases, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to May 2012. We included randomized controlled trials of nonsurgical treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction and abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction. Interventions included the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), progestins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antifibrinolytics. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, danazol, and placebo were allowed as comparators.

Methods Of Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened 5,848 citations and extracted eligible trials. Studies were assessed for quality and strength of evidence.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Twenty-six articles met inclusion criteria. For reduction of menstrual bleeding in women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (71–95% reduction), combined OCPs (35–69% reduction), extended cycle oral progestins (87% reduction), tranexamic acid (26–54% reduction), and NSAIDs (10–52% reduction) were all effective treatments. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined OCPs, and antifibrinolytics were all superior to luteal-phase progestins (20% increase in bleeding to 67% reduction). The levonorgestrel intrauterine system was superior to combined OCPs and NSAIDs. Antifibrinolytics were superior to NSAIDs for menstrual bleeding reduction. Data were limited on other important outcomes such as QOL for women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction and for all outcomes for women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction.

Conclusion

For the reduction in mean blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding presumed secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, we recommend the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system over OCPs, luteal-phase progestins, and NSAIDs. For other outcomes (QOL, pain, sexual health, patient satisfaction, additional treatments needed, and adverse events) and for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction, we were unable to make recommendations based on the limited available data.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^4d57afc0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated.
If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the LNG-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. Approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review summarized the current body of evidence for treating bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUD use (Supplementary Appendix). RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA for the treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs observed no differences between the treatment and placebo groups in bleeding or spotting over 90 days. A prospective cohort study examining oral estradiol demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding days after 3 months of treatment compared with baseline; however, 68% of patients experienced side effects (e.g. painful or swollen breasts, headache, weight gain, and vaginal complaints) (Certainty of evidence: moderate to high for RCTs and very low for the observational study).

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1e5be66c]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Results

Our search identified 174 registration records, of which 86 records referred to trials involving fewer than 500 patients, 68 were retrospectively registered, and five were duplicates. Of the remaining 15 records for which the full registration records or protocols were obtained, a further 10 trials were excluded because they were ongoing, had an unclear or ineligible trial design, or did not assess tranexamic acid. Five completed trials,– met the inclusion criteria, three of which had been completed before publication of our study protocol. Although the trial results were not published at the time we ran our searches, the WOMAN-2 trialists shared IPD for inclusion in this analysis. We obtained IPD for a total of 43 409 women from four included trials (figure 1). Although trialists involved in the TXA Maternal Fetal Medicine Units network (TXA-MFMU) trial agreed to participate, the anonymised individual patient dataset had not been prepared in time to enable inclusion in our analysis; we therefore extracted aggregate data on 10 995 women for this trial from the published trial report (figure 1). A list of the excluded trials with the reasons for their exclusion is shown in the appendix (p 3). Key baseline characteristics of the included trials are shown in table 1 (appendix pp 4–5).

The included trials randomly assigned 54 758 women and provided outcome data for 54 404 women (99.4%). Of the 54 404 women for whom outcome data were available, 33 148 (60.9%) gave birth vaginally, 21 251 (39.1%) gave birth by caesarean, and the type of birth was unknown for five (< 0.1%) women. The type of birth was unknown for five women in the WOMANtrial. The WOMANand WOMAN-2trials recruited mostly in middle-income countries (primarily Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Kenya) and the TRAAP, TRAAP-2, and TXA-MFMUtrials recruited women in high-income countries (France and USA).

The mean maternal age and baseline haemoglobin concentrations differed by trial (table 1). Gestational age was similar across trials, but mean birthweight was about 500 g lower in the WOMAN-2 trial than in the TRAAP trials. No stillbirths were recorded in the TRAAP trials, whereas stillbirth affected nearly one in ten of the women included in the WOMAN trials.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18, 649 patients [^e5e4ac4b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Future perspective

TXA is an important medication that should be used to treat PPH as per WHO recommendations. We have emphasized the preventive use of TXA. Its benefits in reducing bleeding and preventing further complications make it a crucial tool in managing this serious condition. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully consider the risks and benefits of using tranexamic acid on a case-by-case basis. In the future, further research may be conducted to explore the optimal dosing and timing of TXA administration in PPH management. Additionally, efforts may be made to increase access to this medication in low-resource settings where PPH is more prevalent.

Strength and limitations

This study has several strength points: (1) to the best of our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis of TXA for treatment or prophylaxis of PPH provides the most comprehensive evidence to date, (2) the protocol of this study was prospectively registered and all steps were conducted in strict accordance with the PRISMA statement guidelines as well as Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, (3) the certainty in evidence was evaluated by the GRADE framework, (4) the included studies were classified according to multiple considerations such as time of TXA administration and quality of the included studies to provide the most updated and comprehensive evidence to guide the further research.

The major limitation of our meta-analysis is that we excluded many studies due to their low quality (duplicated/fabricated results). Additionally, different techniques were applied to estimate the blood loss, which is difficult to pool in our study, especially during internal bleeding. There is also variation in administering/co-administration of oxytocin and TXA doses pre-or postoperative or during the operation.

Our review is further limited due to minimal assessment or reporting of potential harm effects of TXA compared to the benefits in pregnant women. This is because few studies were identified and included that measured adverse effects, for example, thromboembolism. Thus it is difficult to balance the benefits with harms in our findings.

Although included studies have not shown a significant increase in these events with TXA use, caution should still be exercised when administering it to women with pre-existing clotting disorders or those at high risk for thromboembolism.

### Management of initial bleeding or spotting after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement: a randomized controlled trial [^53fa9ce5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of tranexamic acid or mefenamic acid in the management of the initial "nuisance" bleeding or spotting in the period immediately after placement of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.

Methods

Women were randomized after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement to oral tranexamic acid (500 mg), mefenamic acid (500 mg), or placebo three times daily during bleeding or spotting episodes over a 90-day treatment period. Treatment was initiated from onset of a bleeding or spotting episode and continued until the first day after bleeding or spotting stopped and restarted with a new bleeding or spotting episode. The primary efficacy variable was reduction in the number of bleeding or spotting days. Tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid were compared with placebo using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was used to account for multiple testing.

Results

A total of 204 women were screened; 187 were randomized to tranexamic acid (n = 63), mefenamic acid (n = 63), or placebo (n = 61). The median number of bleeding or spotting days experienced during treatment was 25, 29, and 33 days in the three groups, respectively. The median number of bleeding or spotting days was reduced by 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -14.0 to 1.0, P = 0.049) with tranexamic acid and by 3 days (95% CI -11.0 to 5.0, P = 0.229) with mefenamic acid compared with placebo. The relative risk of bleeding or spotting compared with placebo with tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65–1.03) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.71–1.11), respectively. Most women (85% or more) were satisfied with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system across the groups.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid during the first 90 days after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement do not alleviate "nuisance" bleeding or spotting.

### Progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for heavy menstrual bleeding [^1a870295]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) impacts the quality of life of otherwise healthy women. The perception of HMB is subjective and management depends upon, among other factors, the severity of the symptoms, a woman's age, her wish to get pregnant, and the presence of other pathologies. Heavy menstrual bleeding was classically defined as greater than or equal to 80 mL of blood loss per menstrual cycle. Currently the definition is based on the woman's perception of excessive bleeding which is affecting her quality of life. The intrauterine device was originally developed as a contraceptive but the addition of progestogens to these devices resulted in a large reduction in menstrual blood loss: users of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) reported reductions of up to 90%. Insertion may, however, be regarded as invasive by some women, which affects its acceptability.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, acceptability and safety of progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL (from inception to June 2019); and we searched grey literature and for unpublished trials in trial registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in women of reproductive age treated with LNG-IUS devices versus no treatment, placebo, or other medical or surgical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs (2511 women). Limitations in the evidence included risk of attrition bias and low numbers of participants. The studies compared the following interventions. LNG-IUS versus other medical therapy The other medical therapies were norethisterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral contraceptive pill, mefenamic acid, tranexamic acid or usual medical treatment (where participants could choose the oral treatment that was most suitable). The LNG-IUS may improve HMB, lowering menstrual blood loss according to the alkaline haematin method (mean difference (MD) 66.91 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 42.61 to 91.20; 2 studies, 170 women; low-certainty evidence); and the Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (MD 55.05, 95% CI 27.83 to 82.28; 3 studies, 335 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether the LNG-IUS may have any effect on women's satisfaction up to one year (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.63; 3 studies, 141 women; I² = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). The LNG-IUS probably leads to slightly higher quality of life measured with the SF-36 compared with other medical therapy if (MD 2.90, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.74; 1 study: 571 women; moderate-certainty evidence) or with the Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Scale (MD 13.40, 95% CI 9.89 to 16.91; 1 trial, 571 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The LNG-IUS and other medical therapies probably give rise to similar numbers of women with serious adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 1 study, 571 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Women using other medical therapy are probably more likely to withdraw from treatment for any reason (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60; 1 study, 571 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and to experience treatment failure than women with LNG-IUS (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.44; 6 studies, 535 women; moderate-certainty evidence). LNG-IUS versus endometrial resection or ablation (EA) Bleeding outcome results are inconsistent. We are uncertain of the effect of the LNG-IUS compared to EA on rates of amenorrhoea (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.72; 8 studies, 431 women; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence) and hypomenorrhoea (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.33; 4 studies, 200 women; low-certainty evidence) and eumenorrhoea (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.00; 3 studies, 160 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether both treatments may have similar rates of satisfaction with treatment at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 5 studies, 317 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if the LNG-IUS compared to EA has any effect on quality of life, measured with SF-36 (MD -14.40, 95% CI -22.63 to -6.17; 1 study, 33 women; very low-certainty evidence). Women with the LNG-IUS compared with EA are probably more likely to have any adverse event (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.94; 3 studies, 201 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Women with the LNG-IUS may experience more treatment failure compared to EA at one year follow up (persistent HMB or requirement of additional treatment) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.90; 5 studies, 320 women; low-certainty evidence); or requirement of hysterectomy may be higher at one year follow up (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.42; 3 studies, 400 women; low-certainty evidence). LNG-IUS versus hysterectomy We are uncertain whether the LNG-IUS has any effect on HMB compared with hysterectomy (RR for amenorrhoea 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.70; 1 study, 75 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there is difference between LNG-IUS and hysterectomy in satisfaction at five years (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 1 study, 232 women; low-certainty evidence) and quality of life (SF-36 MD 2.20, 95% CI -2.93 to 7.33; 1 study, 221 women; low-certainty evidence). Women in the LNG-IUS group may be more likely to have treatment failure requiring hysterectomy for HMB at 1-year follow-up compared to the hysterectomy group (RR 48.18, 95% CI 2.96 to 783.22; 1 study, 236 women; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported cost data suitable for meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The LNG-IUS may improve HMB and quality of life compared to other medical therapy; the LNG-IUS is probably similar for HMB compared to endometrial destruction techniques; and we are uncertain if it is better or worse than hysterectomy. The LNG-IUS probably has similar serious adverse events to other medical therapy and it is more likely to have any adverse events than EA.

### Therapeutic options for unscheduled bleeding on hormonal contraception [^36e743d6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Unscheduled bleeding is a common side effect of hormonal contraceptives, often leading to discontinuation. Comprehensive counseling before starting hormonal methods is crucial for improving user satisfaction. For persistent bleeding, common treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and estrogen alone or with progestin in oral contraceptives. Small studies suggest that doxycycline, mifepristone, tranexamic acid, tamoxifen, ulipristal acetate, and clomiphene citrate may reduce bleeding in various contraceptive users. Mifepristone and tranexamic acid show promise for users of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, implants, and intrauterine devices. While NSAIDs and combined oral contraceptives are commonly used, alternative therapies offer potential, though evidence remains limited.

### Oral tranexamic acid and thrombosis risk in women [^1cab0d5c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this historical prospective cohort study, use of oral tranexamic acid implied an increased incidence rate of venous thromboembolism compared to non-use. However, number needed to harm per five days of treatment was high. Use of oral tranexamic acid was not found to be significantly associated with arterial thrombosis.

Oral tranexamic acid is one of the most effective medical therapies for heavy menstrual bleeding. Even after the appearance of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, oral tranexamic acid still plays an essential role in the acute management of heavy menstrual bleeding which no other currently available medical therapy can fill. It also provides a possibility of treatment for women with a current desire of pregnancy or women with contraindications against hormonal therapy and surgical treatment not possible due to a future desire of pregnancy.

In Denmark, oral tranexamic acid is primarily prescribed in the acute management of heavy menstrual bleeding, while the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is used in the long-term management. As a long-term treatment option, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system has shown to be superior and is significantly more affordable compared to oral tranexamic acid. In view of the lack of alternative medical therapies in the acute handling of heavy menstrual bleeding, our findings, based on this pattern of short-term use, is of high clinical relevance.

In women not exposed to oral tranexamic acid, we found the age-standardised incidence rate of venous and arterial thrombosis to be 3 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence rates are comparable with previous studies on the occurrence of thrombotic disease in reproductive-aged women outside the time of surgery, pregnancy, and use of hormonal contraception.

We found the age-standardised incidence rate difference of venous thromboembolism between users and non-users of oral tranexamic acid to be of the same order as the age-standardised incidence rate difference between use and non-use of combined oral contraceptives, which are used regularly to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. The age-standardised incidence rate difference was smaller than that of combined oral contraceptives containing desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone, or cyproterone, but larger than that of combined oral contraceptives including norethisterone, levonorgestrel, or norgestimate.

Recently, it was concluded that prior randomised controlled trials have not been adequately powered to study the association between oral tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding and risk of thrombotic disease.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^3fe69cfc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Acute heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents — initial evaluation and management — notes that physical examination of the patient who presents with acute heavy menstrual bleeding should include assessment of hemodynamic stability, including orthostatic blood pressure and pulse measurements, and in adolescent girls with heavy menstrual bleeding, speculum examination typically is not required. The first-line approach to acute bleeding in the adolescent is medical management; surgery should be reserved for those who do not respond to medical therapy. Use of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid in oral and intravenous form may be used to stop bleeding. Nonmedical procedures should be considered when there is a lack of response to medical therapy, if the patient is clinically unstable despite initial measures, or when severe heavy bleeding warrants further investigation, such as an examination under anesthesia. After correction of acute heavy menstrual bleeding, maintenance hormonal therapy can include combined hormonal contraceptives, oral and injectable progestins, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices.

### Management of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 228 [^8af3a694]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Medical management for uterine leiomyomas — agents addressing only bleeding symptoms include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs), contraceptive steroids, and tranexamic acid, whereas medications that reduce both bleeding and leiomyoma size include GnRH agonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators; some therapies are indicated for long-term use and others serve as a bridge to surgical treatments, interventional procedures, or menopause; because there is insufficient comparative evidence to guide recommendations on first-line medical therapy, options are presented according to symptoms, and treatment decisions should be guided by an individual patient's symptoms and treatment goals.

### The effect of tranexamic acid for treatment of irregular uterine bleeding secondary to norplant use [^cfdcca7f]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of tranexamic acid and placebo on controlling irregular uterine bleeding secondary to Norplant use.

Materials and Methods

A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Sixty-eight Norplant users who had irregular bleeding were randomly allocated into two groups. A total of 34 users received tranexamic acid 500 mg twice a day for 5 days; the placebo was given to the other 34 users in the same manner. The total number of days of bleeding and spotting and the percentage of women whose irregular uterine bleeding was stopped was analyzed at the end of weeks 1 and 4.

Results

In the follow-up period (4 weeks after the initial treatment), a bleeding-free interval of > 20 days was found in 58.8% of the subjects treated with tranexamic acid and in 76.5% treated with placebo (p = .12). The percentage of subjects whose irregular uterine bleeding stopped during week 1 after the initial treatment was significantly higher in the tranexamic acid group than those in the placebo group (64.7% vs. 35.3%, p = .015). The mean number of bleeding/spotting days was not significantly different between the groups (15.4 vs. 12.7 days, p = .182).

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid for 5 days appears to be an effective treatment for irregular uterine bleeding associated with Norplant use only while it is being used. However, treatment for 5 days does not seem to provide long-term benefit.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 735: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^571a73a8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices — bleeding pattern expectations and management in adolescents: Obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel adolescents using IUDs to expect changes in menstrual bleeding, especially in the first months of use. The copper IUD may cause heavier menses, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective for dysmenorrhea or bothersome bleeding from the copper IUD. Many LNG-IUD users will have decreased bleeding over time; lower dose devices have lower rates of amenorrhea and may have higher rates of unscheduled bleeding. Evidence supports treating bleeding and spotting with NSAIDs; in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, naproxen significantly reduced bleeding and spotting in the first 12 weeks of Mirena IUD use, whereas transdermal estradiol increased bleeding and spotting, but tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid did not alleviate nuisance bleeding during the first 90 days. Young women with bleeding concerns that coincide with LARC initiation rarely require extensive evaluation. If an IUD is located within the cervix (partially expelled), the IUD should be removed and can be replaced if desired.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^bff18476]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation poses unique challenges for women of reproductive age. Clinicians prescribing anticoagulants must counsel patients on issues ranging from menstruation and the possibility of developing a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst to teratogenic risks and safety with breastfeeding. Abnormal uterine bleeding affects up to 70% of young women who are treated with anticoagulation. As such, thoughtful clinical guidance is required to avoid having young women who are troubled by their menses, dose reduce, or prematurely discontinue their anticoagulation, leaving them at increased risk of recurrent thrombosis. Informed by a review of the medical literature, we present current recommendations for assisting patients requiring anticoagulation with menstrual management, prevention of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, and avoiding unintended pregnancy. The subdermal implant may be considered a first-line option for those requiring anticoagulation, given its superior contraceptive effectiveness and ability to reliably reduce risk of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. All progestin-only formulations — such as the subdermal implant, intrauterine device, injection, or pills — are generally preferred over combined hormonal pills, patch, or ring. Tranexamic acid, and in rare cases endometrial ablation, may also be useful in managing menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. During pregnancy, enoxaparin remains the preferred anticoagulant and warfarin is contraindicated. Breastfeeding women may use warfarin, but direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended given their limited safety data. This practical guide for clinicians is designed to inform discussions of risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy for women of reproductive age.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^6add63ae]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though uterine fibroids are a widespread condition, the range of approved medical treatment options remains limited. In fact, only a few drugs are officially approved for the therapy of fibroids. In both the USA and the European Medicines Agency region, selected gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been approved for this indication. GnRH analogs are primarily indicated for the preoperative management of uterine fibroids, largely because of their unfavorable long-term adverse effect profile. The previously approved therapy with ulipristal acetate had to undergo extensive restrictions because of safety concerns. Nevertheless, there are additional medications that may be used in clinical practice. These include combined oral contraceptives, oral progestins, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), and tranexamic acid. Although not specifically approved for the treatment of fibroids, these agents can reduce the intensity of bleeding in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby improve symptoms and lead to an improved quality of life for the patients.

### Etonogestrel (Nexplanon) [^f20b2f60]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Changes in Menstrual Bleeding Patterns

After starting NEXPLANON, women are likely to have a change from their normal menstrual bleeding pattern. These may include changes in bleeding frequency (absent, less, more frequent or continuous), intensity (reduced or increased) or duration. In clinical trials of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant (IMPLANON), bleeding patterns ranged from amenorrhea (1 in 5 women) to frequent and/or prolonged bleeding (1 in 5 women). The bleeding pattern experienced during the first three months of NEXPLANON use is broadly predictive of the future bleeding pattern for many women. Women should be counseled regarding the bleeding pattern changes they may experience so that they know what to expect. Abnormal bleeding should be evaluated as needed to exclude pathologic conditions or pregnancy.

In clinical studies of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant, reports of changes in bleeding pattern were the most common reason for stopping treatment (11.1%). Irregular bleeding (10.8%) was the single most common reason women stopped treatment, while amenorrhea (0.3%) was cited less frequently. In these studies, women had an average of 17.7 days of bleeding or spotting every 90 days (based on 3,315 intervals of 90 days recorded by 780 patients). The percentages of patients having 0, 1–7, 8–21, or > 21 days of spotting or bleeding over a 90-day interval while using the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant are shown in Table 1.

Bleeding patterns observed with use of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant for up to 2 years, and the proportion of 90-day intervals with these bleeding patterns, are summarized in Table 2.

In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.

5.3	Ectopic Pregnancies

As with all progestin-only contraceptive products, be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using NEXPLANON who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain. Although ectopic pregnancies are uncommon among women using NEXPLANON, a pregnancy that occurs in a woman using NEXPLANON may be more likely to be ectopic than a pregnancy occurring in a woman using no contraception.

Treatment of pulmonary embolism in women

Hormonal contraceptives may be continued during anticoagulant treatment to prevent pregnancy and mitigate the risk of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Current evidence suggests that the risk of recurrent VTE in women receiving combined hormonal contraceptives or progestin-only contraceptives during anticoagulation for acute PE is not increased. For women with anticoagulant-associated AUB in the setting of PE treatment, management options include omission of NOAC for a single day (for example if bleeding is extremely heavy at a particular day of the cycle), modification of the dose or type of anticoagulant therapy, e.g. switching from an oral factor Xa inhibitor to an oral thrombin inhibitor, commencement of hormonal therapy, addition of tranexamic acid or application of local interventional strategies (including intrauterine devices), with multidisciplinary discussion where appropriate.

Importantly, hormone treatment increases the risk of a recurrent VTE event after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. Available evidence suggests that the risk of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of hormonal contraception (the latter which is associated with a higher VTE risk, mostly relevant to combined hormonal contraceptives) and anticoagulant therapy is lower after hormonal contraception-associated VTE than after unprovoked VTE. Therefore, we propose a limited duration of anticoagulation, rather than indefinite anticoagulation, in these patients after hormonal contraception is discontinued, particularly if the bleeding risk is high and/or if no risk factors for recurrent VTE are present.

Lastly, we suggest that pregnant women with prior VTE associated with hormonal contraceptive use who are not receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy should receive prophylactic or intermediate intensity anticoagulation in the antepartum and postpartum period, pending the results of a large multinational randomized trial (NCT01828697).

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — initial treatment of HM: For patients who wish to preserve fertility, suction dilation and curettage (D&C) is preferred and is preferably performed under ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of uterine perforation; to reduce bleeding, uterotonic agents (eg, methylergonovine and/or prostaglandins) should be administered during the procedure and continued for several hours postoperatively, tranexamic acid (TXA) can be considered if necessary, and for those who do not wish to preserve fertility, hysterectomy with salpingectomy can be considered as an alternative.

8 TRANEXAMIC ACID

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine that inhibits fibrinolysis by reducing the binding of plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to fibrin. Labeled indications of this medication are cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding, and oral procedures in patients with hemophilia. An antifibrinolytic drug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding, and although existing medical and surgical interventions can be used to treat postpartum bleeding, TXA offers an alternative way to support hemostasis.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^8777f2c4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cu-IUD — bleeding irregularities management and evidence: During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, common side effects including spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. If the patient wants treatment during days of bleeding, NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days, may be considered. Evidence includes a systematic review that identified 11 studies among Cu-IUD users, with Nine studies examining oral NSAIDs; however, only one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo, but an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss for pretreatment menstrual blood loss ≥ 80 mL or 60–80 mL and resulted in a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL. A trial of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline, while one small study of three separate NSAIDs did not observe improvements in spotting in any group.

### Safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid in general surgery… [^dc86f3aa]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this substudy of a randomized clinical trial that included 9535 participants, among whom 3260 underwent a general surgery procedure, prophylactic TXA significantly reduced major bleeding events without significant differences in safety events compared with placebo. There were no subgroup effects according to whether patients underwent general surgery vs nongeneral surgery procedures. Meaning In this study, prophylactic TXA reduced bleeding without increasing cardiovascular risk for both general surgery and nongeneral surgery patients. Importance Perioperative bleeding is common in general surgery. The POISE-3 trial demonstrated efficacy of prophylactic tranexamic acid compared with placebo in preventing major bleeding without increasing vascular outcomes in noncardiac surgery. Objective To determine the safety and efficacy of prophylactic TXA, specifically in general surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ. The primary safety outcome was a composite of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, nonhemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis, or symptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism at 30 days. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted, incorporating tests of interaction. There was no significant interaction by type of surgery on the primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Across subtypes of general surgery, TXA decreased the composite bleeding outcome in hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery and colorectal surgery. There was no significant interaction across subtypes of general surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance In this study, TXA significantly reduced the risk of perioperative bleeding without increasing cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing general surgery procedures.

Step 18. Request that the woman palpate the implant.

Step 19. Apply a pressure bandage with sterile gauze to minimize bruising. The woman may remove the pressure bandage in 24 hours and the small adhesive bandage over the insertion site after 3 to 5 days.

Step 20. Complete the PATIENT CHART LABEL and affix it to the woman's medical record.

Step 21. The applicator is for single use only and should be disposed in accordance with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for handling of hazardous waste.

If the rod is not palpable after insertion:

If you cannot feel the implant or are in doubt of its presence, the implant may not have been inserted or it may have been inserted deeply:

Check the applicator. The needle should be fully retracted and only the purple tip of the obturator should be visible.
Use other methods to confirm the presence of the implant. Given the radiopaque nature of the implant, suitable methods for localization are two-dimensional X-ray and X-ray computerized tomography (CT scan). Ultrasound scanning (USS) with a high-frequency linear array transducer (10 MHz or greater) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used. If these methods fail, call the Organon Service Center at 1-844-674-3200 for information on the procedure for measuring etonogestrel blood levels which can be used for verification of the presence of the implant.

Until the presence of the implant has been verified, the woman should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method, such as condoms.

Deeply-placed implants should be localized and removed as soon as possible to avoid the potential for distant migration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^eed16842]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common symptom in women. The acronym PALM-COEIN facilitates classification, with PALM referring to structural etiologies (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia), and COEIN referring to nonstructural etiologies (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, not otherwise classified). Evaluation involves a detailed history and pelvic examination, as well as laboratory testing that includes a pregnancy test and complete blood count. Endometrial sampling should be performed in patients 45 years and older, and in younger patients with a significant history of unopposed estrogen exposure. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality and is indicated if a structural etiology is suspected or if symptoms persist despite appropriate initial treatment. Medical and surgical treatment options are available. Emergency interventions for severe bleeding that causes hemodynamic instability include uterine tamponade, intravenous estrogen, dilation and curettage, and uterine artery embolization. To avoid surgical risks and preserve fertility, medical management is the preferred initial approach for hemodynamically stable patients. Patients with severe bleeding can be treated initially with oral estrogen, high-dose estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, or intravenous tranexamic acid. The most effective long-term medical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Other long-term medical treatment options include estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, oral tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and depot medroxyprogesterone. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment. A lower-risk surgical option is endometrial ablation, which performs as well as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Select patients with chronic uterine bleeding can be treated with myomectomy, polypectomy, or uterine artery embolization.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All literature search results were combined and collected in Microsoft Excel. Duplicate articles were removed manually. Two independent reviewers (A.W.H. K.H.T.) then screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility. Both reviewers completed this process independently, and a consensus was required before full-text review. Full-text review of all articles meeting the eligibility criteria then determined final inclusion.

Data extraction involved the same 2 independent reviewers. One reviewer extracted the data using a standardized pro forma. The second reviewer checked the extracted data for inaccuracies. Any disagreement in data extraction was resolved by discussion and involvement of a third reviewer (M.S.R.) as necessary. Attempts to contact corresponding authors for studies regarding unclear or missing data or for any additional details required were made via email. Microsoft Excel was used for data capture and RevMan Version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) for data management.

Data extraction included study design, patient cohort, study characteristics, TXA dose/method of delivery, control group intervention, primary outcome measures, and any secondary outcome measures. Means and standard deviations were extracted for all outcome measures. Where the mean or standard deviation was not reported, the corresponding author was contacted to request raw data.

### Antifibrinolytics for heavy menstrual bleeding [^f4a70dcd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important physical and social problem for women. Oral treatment for HMB includes antifibrinolytic drugs, which are designed to reduce bleeding by inhibiting clot-dissolving enzymes in the endometrium. Historically, there has been some concern that using the antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA) for HMB may increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease. This is an umbrella term for deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels in the legs) and pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the blood vessels in the lungs).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic medications as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registers in November 2017, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antifibrinolytic agents versus placebo, no treatment or other medical treatment in women of reproductive age with HMB. Twelve studies utilised TXA and one utilised a prodrug of TXA (Kabi).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were menstrual blood loss (MBL), improvement in HMB, and thromboembolic events.

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs (1312 participants analysed). The evidence was very low to moderate quality: the main limitations were risk of bias (associated with lack of blinding, and poor reporting of study methods), imprecision and inconsistency. Antifibrinolytics (TXA or Kabi) versus no treatment or placeboWhen compared with a placebo, antifibrinolytics were associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD -53.20 mL per cycle, 95% CI -62.70 to -43.70; I² = 8%; 4 RCTs, participants = 565; moderate-quality evidence) and higher rates of improvement (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.84 to 6.09; 3 RCTS, participants = 271; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if 11% of women improve without treatment, 43% to 63% of women taking antifibrinolytics will do so. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 RCT, participants = 297; low-quality evidence). Only one thromboembolic event occurred in the two studies that reported this outcome.TXA versus progestogensThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in mean blood loss measured using the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) (MD -12.22 points per cycle, 95% CI -30.8 to 6.36; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, participants = 312; very low quality evidence), but TXA was associated with a higher likelihood of improvement (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.80; I² = 32%; 5 RCTs, participants = 422; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 46% of women improve with progestogens, 61% to 83% of women will do so with TXA. Adverse events were less common in the TXA group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94; I² = 28%; 4 RCTs, participants = 349; low-quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported in any group.TXA versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)TXA was associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD -73.00 mL per cycle, 95% CI -123.35 to -22.65; 1 RCT, participants = 49; low-quality evidence) and higher likelihood of improvement (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.74; 1 2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, participants = 161; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 61% of women improve with NSAIDs, 71% to 100% of women will do so with TXA. Adverse events were uncommon and no comparative data were available. No thromboembolic events were reported.TXA versus ethamsylateTXA was associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD 100 mL per cycle, 95% CI -141.82 to -58.18; 1 RCT, participants = 53; low-quality evidence), but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of improvement (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.55; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.15; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality evidence).TXA versus herbal medicines (Safoof Habis and Punica granatum)TXA was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score after three months' treatment (MD -23.90 pts per cycle, 95% CI -31.92 to -15.88; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, participants = 121; low-quality evidence). No data were available for rates of improvement. TXA was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score three months after the end of the treatment phase (MD -10.40 points per cycle, 95% CI -19.20 to -1.60; I² not applicable; 1 RCT, participants = 84; very low quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of adverse events (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.74 to 6.80; 1 RCT, participants = 94; very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported.TXA versus levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS)TXA was associated with a higher median PBAC score than TXA (median difference 125.5 points; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence) and a lower likelihood of improvement (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence). This suggests that if 85% of women improve with LIUS, 20% to 65% of women will do so with TXA. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Antifibrinolytic treatment (such as TXA) appears effective for treating HMB compared to placebo, NSAIDs, oral luteal progestogens, ethamsylate, or herbal remedies, but may be less effective than LIUS. There were too few data for most comparisons to determine whether antifibrinolytics were associated with increased risk of adverse events, and most studies did not specifically include thromboembolism as an outcome.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^eaa24e10]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Immediate post-abortion long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in bleeding disorders or anticoagulation — eligibility and procedural considerations are as follows: Per the United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC), the Cu-IUD is category 2 in women with venous thromboembolism (VTE) on anticoagulation for at least 3 months or with acute VTE, whereas the LNG-IUD is category 2 in women with acute VTE or a history of VTE on anticoagulation; individuals with bleeding disorders or who are anticoagulated can safely be offered LNG-IUD and it is likely to improve their bleeding (GRADE 1A). In general, IUD insertion can be done without prophylaxis medications to prevent bleeding, but if the bleeding disorder is severe, hemostatic coverage and consultation with hematology should be considered. For the etonogestrel implant, the US MEC rates use in women with a history of VTE on anticoagulation and in those with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding as category 2, and implants can likely be inserted without interruption of anticoagulation treatment as long as the patient is in the therapeutic range.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^a4439219]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The most effective contraceptives are the etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) and 52mg levonorgestrel-containing IUD (Liletta or Mirena). These contraceptives are rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired and typically more effective than permanent contraception with tubal ligation. Further, the subdermal implant and IUDs have very high rates of user satisfaction and continuation. Although the contraceptive pill, patch, and ring are effective methods of contraception, they require reliable patient adherence to be effective. Since it is difficult for some patients to remember to take a pill every day, pregnancy rates with typical use of oral contraceptives are estimated at 8–9% within the first year of use. Among progestin-only contraceptives, the 0.35mg norethindrone-only pill is the most sensitive to missed or late doses; the newest drosperinone-only pill (Slynd) has a longer half-life and so is less sensitive to timing of doses. The use of barrier methods (i.e. condoms, diaphragms) without another form of contraception can result in failure rates that some patients consider unacceptably high, particularly when treated with a teratogenic medication. When a patient prefers to rely on a barrier or behavioral method, such as withdrawal, they should be provided with information about and a prescription for emergency contraceptive pills. Depending on gestational age and individual risk factors, termination of an undesired pregnancy (whether with a medication or procedure) can usually be safely performed without interrupting anticoagulation.

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

No studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of NEXPLANON. The use of NEXPLANON in women with active liver disease is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

8.7	Overweight Women

The effectiveness of the etonogestrel implant in women who weighed more than 130% of their ideal body weight has not been defined because such women were not studied in clinical trials. Serum concentrations of etonogestrel are inversely related to body weight and decrease with time after implant insertion. It is therefore possible that NEXPLANON may be less effective in overweight women, especially in the presence of other factors that decrease serum etonogestrel concentrations such as concomitant use of hepatic enzyme inducers.

### Sex matters: practice 5P's when treating young women with venous thromboembolism [^098e9438]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no studies that report data on menstrual bleeding patterns in women treated with unfractionated heparin or low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH). Treatment duration with unfractionated heparin or LMWH is relatively short and prescribed in a prophylactic dosage in the majority of patients. Patients of fertile age treated with therapeutic‐dose LMWH often are pregnant patients or patients treated for cancer. In these populations, menstrual blood loss is either absent or a non‐issue.

2.1 Management of abnormal uterine bleeding

Abnormal uterine bleeding is chronic in nature and it negatively impacts quality of life. 21 Therefore, adequate treatment is imperative. A step‐by‐step assessment and management strategy in women using anticoagulants was recently discussed by Boonyawat and colleagues. 22 They suggest that clinical assessment includes at least evaluation of anticoagulant therapy intensity, need for ongoing anticoagulation (see also paragraph in Section 4) and evaluation of anemia and iron status. 22 Referral to a gynecologist is mandatory when additional underlying uterine abnormalities are suspected. 23

Suggested management options encompass 3 main potential approaches: (a) hormonal therapy, (b) tranexamic acid and (c) modification of anticoagulant therapy. Table A1 displays an evidence‐based summary of management strategies for abnormal vaginal bleeding during anticoagulant treatment.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The efficacy of NEXPLANON does not depend on daily, weekly, or monthly administration.

All healthcare professionals should receive instruction and training prior to performing insertion and/or removal of NEXPLANON.

A single NEXPLANON implant is inserted subdermally just under the skin at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. The insertion site is overlying the triceps muscle about 8–10 cm (3–4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and 3–5 cm (1.25–2 inches) posterior to (below) the sulcus (groove) between the biceps and triceps muscles. This location is intended to avoid the large blood vessels and nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus (see Figures 2a, 2b and 2c). Inserting an implant more deeply than subdermally (a deep insertion) may preclude palpation and localization, making removal difficult or impossible [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

NEXPLANON must be inserted by the expiration date stated on the packaging. NEXPLANON is a long-acting (up to 3 years), reversible, hormonal contraceptive method. The implant must be removed by the end of the third year and may be replaced by a new implant at the time of removal, if continued contraceptive protection is desired.

2.1	Initiating Contraception with NEXPLANON

IMPORTANT: Rule out pregnancy before inserting the implant.

Timing of insertion depends on the woman's recent contraceptive history, as follows:

- No preceding hormonal contraceptive use in the past month

NEXPLANON should be inserted between Day 1 (first day of menstrual bleeding) and Day 5 of the menstrual cycle, even if the woman is still bleeding.

If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for abnormal uterine bleeding, more specifically with respect to endometrial ablation, technical considerations, SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using one or more of the following techniques for the management of acute hemorrhage if uterine perforation has been ruled out during resectoscopic endometrial ablation:

- intrauterine Foley balloon tamponade

- intracervical vasopressors injection

- administration of rectal misoprostol

- systemic administration of tranexamic acid.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^0ceb0aa8]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Very recent evidence also indicates that TXA usage results in a significant reduction of obstetric bleeding. – In the landmark randomized, double blind World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, more than 20,000 women with PPH following vaginal or Cesarean delivery were assigned to receive either TXA (1 g TXA intravenously as soon as possible, followed by a further 1 g if bleeding continued after 30 min or restarted within 24 h of the initial dose) or placebo. The trial showed a decreased overall mortality due to bleeding in the TXA group (RR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.00; P = 0.045) (Table 1), and no differences in venous or arterial thromboembolic events were observed between women in the two arms. Similarly to the CRASH trials, in the WOMAN trial patients receiving TXA within 3 h from delivery had the most marked mortality reduction (89 deaths in the TXA group vs. 127 deaths in the placebo group, RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52–0.91; P = 0.008). Thanks to the results of this global trial, a 2017 World Health Organization recommendation for the treatment of PPH states that TXA should be recognized as a life-saving intervention and thus made readily available for the management of PPH in settings in which emergency obstetric care is provided, regardless of the level of healthcare system resources. In addition, the recent NATA consensus statement recommends the administration of TXA (1 g by intravenous route) as soon as possible within the first 3 h after PPH onset, with this dose repeated after 30 min if bleeding continues (grade 1B recommendation).

All in all, these large trials document with unequivocal evidence the beneficial effect of early administration of TXA in an array of patients with acute critical bleeding, without increasing the risk of adverse events.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^f9acf402]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 14 percent of women experience irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding. This abnormal uterine bleeding generally can be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with recurrent anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy. Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding, or menorrhagia, may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovulatory bleeding, but is expensive. When clear structural causes are identified or medical management is ineffective, polypectomy, fibroidectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation may be considered. Hysterectomy is the most definitive treatment.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^b192624b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 785 — acute management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents — states that the first-line approach to acute bleeding in the adolescent is medical management; surgery should be reserved for those who do not respond to medical therapy. Adolescents who are hemodynamically unstable or actively bleeding heavily should be hospitalized for management. In the absence of contraindications to estrogen, hormonal therapy for acute heavy menstrual bleeding can consist of intravenous conjugated estrogen every 4–6 hours; alternatively, monophasic combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (in 30–50 microgram ethinyl estradiol formulation) can be used every 6–8 hours until cessation of bleeding. Use of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid in oral and intravenous form may be used to stop bleeding. After correction of acute heavy menstrual bleeding, maintenance hormonal therapy can include combined hormonal contraceptives, oral and injectable progestins, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs). Iron replacement therapy should be provided for all reproductive-aged women with anemia due to bleeding. Nonmedical procedures should be considered when there is a lack of response to medical therapy, if the patient is clinically unstable despite initial measures, or when severe heavy bleeding warrants further investigation, such as an examination under anesthesia. Obstetrician–gynecologists can provide important guidance to premenarchal and postmenarchal girls and should counsel all adolescent patients with a bleeding disorder about safe medication use and future surgical considerations. Adolescents with a bleeding disorder should be reminded that products that prevent platelet adhesion, such as aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, should be used only with the recommendation of a hematologist. In adolescents with known bleeding disorders, preoperative surgical evaluation, choice of hemostatic agents, and need for blood products should be determined in conjunction with a hematologist and an anesthesiologist.

### Oral tranexamic acid for prevention and treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [^cf6ff988]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a skin disorder characterized by hyperpigmentation resulting from heightened inflammation and/or damage to the basement membrane, melanocytes, and keratinocytes, leading to abnormal and excessive pigment deposition. Oral tranexamic acid (TXA), originally used as an antifibrinolytic for managing excessive bleeding, has garnered attention for its demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating melasma. There is a growing body of evidence regarding the use of TXA in the treatment of PIH.

Objective

To review the mechanism of action of oral TXA in treating PIH and examine the use of oral TXA in preventing and/or treating PIH associated with laser-based and light-based treatments in individuals with skin color.

Methods

Review of relevant articles from 2000 to present found in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, regarding the use of oral TXA in the treatment of PIH.

Results

Studies reviewed investigated the efficacy of oral tranexamic acid (TXA) in treating postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and use in preventing PIH when used in conjunction with other treatments. All studies demonstrated significant improvement in PIH without significant adverse effects and side effects.

Conclusion

Oral tranexamic acid is emerging as a safe and effective treatment in the prevention and treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^a5b3693e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Anticoagulant Medication Effects for Women of Reproductive Age

AUB can negatively impact many dimensions of a woman's life and lead to self-discontinuation or dose reduction around menses, which can increase risk for recurrent thrombosis. Accordingly, clinicians caring for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation should obtain detailed menstrual histories prior to initiating anticoagulation and at least annually during treatment. Menstruating women should be screened with a complete blood count and ferritin at least annually. Clinicians should provide patients with anticipatory guidance and recommend management strategies for AUB, which can usually be effectively managed with hormonal medications.

Controlling Heavy Menses

Menstrual flow can be safely reduced with several medications that do not adversely impact future fertility. Progestin-only preparations may be preferable over estrogen-containing preparations for patients on anticoagulation, as current evidence suggests they do not increase thrombosis risk. – The only contraindication to use of progestin-only formulations is a personal history of breast cancer. Progestin-only products include pills (norethindrone 0.35 mg (sometimes called the "mini-pill"), drosperinone 4 mg, norethindrone 5–10mg, and outside of the US, desogestrel 75mcg), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections, levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine devices (IUD), and the etonogestrel subdermal arm implant (Nexplanon). Among these options, the 52 mg levonorgesterel-bearing IUD (marketed as Liletta and Mirena) is the most effective in controlling menses among women with AUB. An IUD can be safely placed during a simple office visit for women who are anticoagulated. Lower dose levonorgestrel-containing IUDs (Skyla or Kyleena) are safe but show no advantage over the higher dose IUDs and are less effective at controlling menses.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^87c3a7fd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) bleeding irregularities — counseling and management include that during contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; if the patient desires Cu-IUD removal at any time, remove the Cu-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired; and if the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered during days of bleeding, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days. Evidence summarized on-page states that a systematic review identified 11 studies, that all but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use, and that one study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss but a FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism; treatment with aspirin showed no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was > 80 mL or 60–80 mL and a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL; one study of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline; and one small study did not observe improvements in spotting with three separate NSAIDs.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18, 649 patients [^10a33b9d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

In recent years, TXA has gained attention as an effective treatment for PPH. Several studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of TXA in PPH. The WOMAN trial, which was a large randomized controlled trial involving over 20,000 women from 21 countries, found that TXA reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by 31% when given within three hours of birth throughout. Another study conducted in Nigeria also showed that TXA reduced the need for blood transfusion and hysterectomy in women with PPH.

While some studies have shown promising results of TXA, limited studies represented a full understanding of its effectiveness and potential side effects. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to update current clinical evidence and determine the clinical efficacy and safety of TXA in the prevention of PPH. We collected up-to-date studies on both CB and VB, which will assist physicians in deciding whether to include TXA in their routine preoperative prophylaxis for PPH.

### Options for prevention and management of menstrual bleeding in adolescent patients undergoing cancer treatment: ACOG committee opinion, number 817 [^39ece3b8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Adolescent cancer treatment — antifibrinolytic therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding notes that antifibrinolytics prevent fibrin degradation and affect tissue plasminogen activator; oral and intravenous tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding and is contraindicated in patients with active thromboembolic disease, a history of thrombosis or thromboembolism, or an intrinsic risk of thrombosis or thromboembolism; although product labeling lists combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) as a contraindication, clinical experience does not indicate an increased risk of VTE with combined use; oncology patients have largely been excluded from studies, and more information is needed, but it may be reasonable to consider tranexamic acid as an option for an oncology patient with life-threatening bleeding.
