## Question

how frequently the follow-up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how frequently follow-up should occur across different conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the question refers to a specific disease or a general framework. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for common scenarios like colorectal cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and chronic diseases. Next, I will extract principles that generalize across conditions, including risk stratification, time-based intensity, and modality selection. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties where evidence is limited or evolving [^b18e88d1].

> Let me first confirm the scope and why this is hard to answer universally. Follow-up frequency is inherently condition-specific and often evidence-limited; many guidelines acknowledge uncertainty and recommend individualization rather than fixed intervals, so I need to avoid overgeneralization and instead anchor on principles and exemplar diseases with strong data [^b18e88d1] [^ff543d07] [^b0245c33].

> I will now examine colorectal cancer after curative-intent treatment, where randomized data are most robust. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit: multiple RCTs and Cochrane reviews show that intensive follow-up increases salvage surgery with curative intent but does not improve overall survival, so more frequent visits or imaging are not justified by mortality benefit alone; typical schedules include history, exam, and CEA every 3–6 months for 5 years, CT chest/abdomen annually for 3 years, and colonoscopy at 1 year then every 5 years, with intensity tailored to risk and fitness for intervention [^ff543d07] [^fdf9b443] [^36b5e8f3].

> Next, I should review breast cancer follow-up. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: RCTs show that routine clinic visits plus annual mammography are as effective as more intensive testing for survival and recurrence detection, and many guidelines individualize based on age, diagnosis, and treatment; ASCO/ACS endorse individualized schedules, and Dutch practice uses annual visits for 5 years with age-based adjustments thereafter, reflecting risk–benefit tradeoffs and patient preferences [^b0245c33] [^a1348067] [^f26a5798].

> For melanoma, I need to check the evidence base because practice varies widely. The literature suggests that routine imaging and blood tests in asymptomatic patients yield low yield and many false positives, and there is no convincing evidence that surveillance improves survival; thus, many centers individualize based on stage, with more frequent visits early on for higher-risk patients and de-emphasis of routine imaging in low-risk stages [^2c5e2078] [^bf4af6d9] [^5fe00753].

> Let me consider chronic coronary syndromes and peripheral artery disease to see how non-oncologic conditions frame follow-up. The ESC recommends periodic visits, typically annually, for risk factor control and symptom review, with frequency adjusted to clinical status; for PAD, at least annual follow-up is advised to assess symptoms, adherence, and consider ABI when indicated, again with escalation if disease progresses or new symptoms arise [^588d3351] [^2f0de1fe].

> I should double-check the general principles that emerge across conditions. First, risk stratification drives intensity: higher-risk patients generally merit closer follow-up early in the disease course, whereas lower-risk patients may do well with less frequent visits. Second, time-based intensity is common: more frequent follow-up in the first 2–5 years after definitive therapy, then tapering if stable. Third, modality should match what changes management: in CRC, CEA and CT can lead to curative salvage; in breast cancer, mammography is the key test; in melanoma, clinical examination is prioritized over routine labs or imaging in asymptomatic patients. Fourth, patient-centeredness matters: shared decision-making, acceptability of telehealth or primary care–led models, and alignment with patient preferences improve engagement and outcomes [^ff543d07] [^b0245c33] [^d73f9178].

> But wait, what if there is no high-quality evidence for a specific disease? I need to ensure I flag uncertainty and default to expert consensus or pragmatic individualization. Many guidelines explicitly state evidence is insufficient for optimal frequency or modality, prompting clinicians to tailor to disease biology, treatment exposures, comorbidities, and patient values, and to revisit as new evidence emerges [^b18e88d1] [^8c5e88ed] [^867c902b].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach without overpromising. For most curatively treated cancers, a reasonable template is intensive follow-up every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then every 6–12 months for years 4–5, and annually thereafter if low risk and stable, with tests focused on those that change management; for chronic cardiovascular disease, annual visits are typical with earlier reassessment if symptoms or risk factors change; for surgical or device-related conditions, early frequent checks taper to annual once stable; and for low-risk or indolent conditions, longer intervals may suffice, always with a low threshold to escalate if new symptoms arise [^fdf9b443] [^588d3351] [^2f0de1fe].

> I should confirm special populations and modifiers. Older adults with limited life expectancy may have follow-up de-intensified to avoid overdiagnosis and burden, whereas younger patients with long life expectancy may merit sustained surveillance; multimorbidity, patient preference, access, and the feasibility of telehealth or shared care can justify alternative models that maintain safety while improving convenience and cost-effectiveness [^f26a5798] [^b0245c33] [^d73f9178].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that there is no single "right" follow-up frequency; evidence-based ranges and individualized plans are the safest answer. Intensive follow-up can increase detection of recurrences and salvage opportunities in some cancers but does not consistently improve survival, so frequency should be calibrated to risk, time since treatment, modality yield, and patient goals, with explicit plans to reassess and adjust over time [^ff543d07] [^b0245c33] [^b18e88d1].

Follow-up frequency should be **individualized** based on disease, treatment, and patient risk, with more frequent visits early on and tapering as stability improves. For most chronic conditions, **annual follow-up** is reasonable once stable, but high-risk patients or those on active therapy may need visits every 3–6 months or even more often initially. Evidence-based examples include colorectal cancer (every 3–6 months for 5 years) [^fdf9b443], breast cancer (every 3–6 months for 3 years, then annually) [^e12ece0b], and hypertension (every 3–6 months until controlled, then annually) [^fa3867aa]. Always adjust to clinical changes, patient preference, and guideline updates [^a1348067].

## General principles influencing follow-up frequency

Several factors **guide how often follow-up should occur**:

- **Disease severity and stage**: More severe or advanced disease typically requires closer monitoring.
- **Treatment modality**: Active treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy) often necessitate frequent visits, whereas stable, post-treatment surveillance may allow longer intervals.
- **Patient risk profile**: High-risk patients (e.g. comorbidities, genetic predisposition) generally need more frequent follow-up.
- **Clinical stability**: Stable patients may have longer intervals, whereas unstable or symptomatic patients require closer monitoring.
- **Patient preferences and logistics**: Shared decision-making and practical considerations (travel, access) influence scheduling.

## Evidence-based follow-up frequencies by condition

| **Condition** | **Recommended follow-up frequency** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Colorectal cancer (post-curative) | Every 3–6 months for 5 years | High [^fdf9b443] [^ff543d07] |
| Breast cancer (early stage) | Every 3–6 months for 3 years, then annually | Moderate [^e12ece0b] [^b0245c33] |
| Hypertension | Every 3–6 months until controlled, then annually | High [^fa3867aa] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Every 3–6 months depending on stage and stability | High [^notfound] |
| Heart transplant recipients | Frequent early visits, then annually after year 1 | High [^49046068] |
| Peripheral artery disease | Annually | High [^2f0de1fe] |
| Osteoporosis | DEXA every 1–2 years until stable | High [^eca48f27] |

## Role of patient-specific factors

Patient-specific factors **significantly influence follow-up frequency**:

- **Age**: Older patients may require more frequent monitoring due to higher risk of complications and comorbidities.
- **Comorbidities**: Multiple comorbidities often necessitate closer follow-up.
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Limited access to care, transportation issues, and financial constraints may require tailored follow-up plans.
- **Patient preferences**: Some patients prefer frequent reassurance, while others prefer minimal interference.

---

## Impact of follow-up frequency on patient outcomes

Follow-up frequency **impacts outcomes** in several ways:

- **Early detection of recurrence or progression**: More frequent follow-up can enable earlier detection and intervention, potentially improving outcomes [^ff543d07].
- **Patient satisfaction and adherence**: Regular follow-up can improve patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment plans.
- **Resource utilization**: Excessive follow-up without added benefit can strain healthcare resources and increase costs [^ff543d07].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized follow-up** based on disease-specific evidence, patient risk, and clinical judgment. Regular reassessment and adjustment of follow-up frequency are recommended as patient conditions evolve [^a1348067] [^8c5e88ed].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Follow-up frequency should be **individualized** based on disease, treatment, and patient-specific factors. Annual follow-up is reasonable for stable chronic conditions, but high-risk or actively treated patients may need more frequent visits. Regular reassessment and alignment with current guidelines ensure optimal outcomes and resource use.

### The conundrum of follow-up: should it be abandoned? [^2c5e2078]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This article critically evaluates the practice of follow-up for patients who have undergone treatment for a primary melanoma without evidence of metastases. One conclusion from this analysis is that the benefits of routine imaging and blood testing are insufficient to warrant a place in routine follow-up. Few patients who have metastases are identified in this fashion and even fewer survive because they underwent these tests. Far more often, false-positive results occur, which invariably cause unnecessary concern, lead to additional unnecessary testing, and may even result in needless surgery. Based on the evidence available, the relevance of follow-up per se must even be challenged. No convincing evidence exists that regional control, survival, and quality of life improve through surveillance. Other reasons for surveillance may be present, but these are less imperative. The present findings challenge current practice.

### Follow-up strategies for patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer [^8d98b906]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is common clinical practice to follow patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for several years following their curative surgery or adjuvant therapy, or both. Despite this widespread practice, there is considerable controversy about how often patients should be seen, what tests should be performed, and whether these varying strategies have any significant impact on patient outcomes. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and first updated in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intensive follow-up for patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer treated with curative intent.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to May 20th, 2016), Embase (1974 to May 20th, 2016), CINAHL (1981 to May 20th, 2016), and Science Citation Index (1900 to May 20th, 2016). We also searched reference lists of articles, and handsearched the Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (2011 to 2014). In addition, we searched the following trials registries (May 20th, 2016): ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We further contacted study authors. No language or publication restrictions were applied to the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing different follow-up strategies for participants with non-metastatic CRC treated with curative intent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently determined trial eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed methodological quality.

Main Results

We studied 5403 participants enrolled in 15 studies. (We included two new studies in this second update.) Although the studies varied in setting (general practitioner (GP)-led, nurse-led, or surgeon-led) and "intensity" of follow-up, there was very little inconsistency in the results. Overall survival: we found no evidence of a statistical effect with intensive follow-up (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.02; I² = 4%; P = 0.41; high-quality evidence). There were 1098 deaths among 4786 participants enrolled in 12 studies. Colorectal cancer-specific survival: this did not differ with intensive follow-up (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; I² = 0%; P = 0.45; moderate-quality evidence). There were 432 colorectal cancer deaths among 3769 participants enrolled in seven studies. Relapse-free survival: we found no statistical evidence of effect with intensive follow-up (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; I² = 5%; P = 0.39; moderate-quality evidence). There were 1416 relapses among 5253 participants enrolled in 14 studies. Salvage surgery with curative intent: this was more frequent with intensive follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.56; I² = 31%; P = 0.14; high-quality evidence). There were 457 episodes of salvage surgery in 5157 participants enrolled in 13 studies. Interval (symptomatic) recurrences: these were less frequent with intensive follow-up (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; I² = 66%; P = 0.007; moderate-quality evidence). Three hundred and seventy-six interval recurrences were reported in 3933 participants enrolled in seven studies. Intensive follow-up did not appear to affect quality of life, anxiety, nor depression (reported in three studies). Harms from colonoscopies did not differ with intensive follow-up (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.11 to 40.17; moderate-quality evidence). In two studies, there were seven colonoscopic complications in 2112 colonoscopies.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review suggest that there is no overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Although more participants were treated with salvage surgery with curative intent in the intensive follow-up group, this was not associated with improved survival. Harms related to intensive follow-up and salvage therapy were not well reported.

### Follow-up strategies for patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer [^ff543d07]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the fourth update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2016. It is common clinical practice to follow patients with colorectal cancer for several years following their curative surgery or adjuvant therapy, or both. Despite this widespread practice, there is considerable controversy about how often patients should be seen, what tests should be performed, and whether these varying strategies have any significant impact on patient outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effect of follow-up programmes (follow-up versus no follow-up, follow-up strategies of varying intensity, and follow-up in different healthcare settings) on overall survival for patients with colorectal cancer treated with curative intent. Secondary objectives are to assess relapse-free survival, salvage surgery, interval recurrences, quality of life, and the harms and costs of surveillance and investigations.

Search Methods

For this update, on 5 April 2109 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index. We also searched reference lists of articles, and handsearched the Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology. In addition, we searched the following trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We contacted study authors. We applied no language or publication restrictions to the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing different follow-up strategies for participants with non-metastatic colorectal cancer treated with curative intent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently determined study eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and methodological quality. We used GRADE to assess evidence quality.

Main Results

We identified 19 studies, which enrolled 13,216 participants (we included four new studies in this second update). Sixteen out of the 19 studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis. Although the studies varied in setting (general practitioner (GP)-led, nurse-led, or surgeon-led) and 'intensity' of follow-up, there was very little inconsistency in the results. Overall survival: we found intensive follow-up made little or no difference (hazard ratio (HR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.04: I² = 18%; high-quality evidence). There were 1453 deaths among 12,528 participants in 15 studies. In absolute terms, the average effect of intensive follow-up on overall survival was 24 fewer deaths per 1000 patients, but the true effect could lie between 60 fewer to 9 more per 1000 patients. Colorectal cancer-specific survival: we found intensive follow-up probably made little or no difference (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07: I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There were 925 colorectal cancer deaths among 11,771 participants enrolled in 11 studies. In absolute terms, the average effect of intensive follow-up on colorectal cancer-specific survival was 15 fewer colorectal cancer-specific survival deaths per 1000 patients, but the true effect could lie between 47 fewer to 12 more per 1000 patients. Relapse-free survival: we found intensive follow-up made little or no difference (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.21; I² = 41%; high-quality evidence). There were 2254 relapses among 8047 participants enrolled in 16 studies. The average effect of intensive follow-up on relapse-free survival was 17 more relapses per 1000 patients, but the true effect could lie between 30 fewer and 66 more per 1000 patients. Salvage surgery with curative intent: this was more frequent with intensive follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.56; I² = 31%; high-quality evidence). There were 457 episodes of salvage surgery in 5157 participants enrolled in 13 studies. In absolute terms, the effect of intensive follow-up on salvage surgery was 60 more episodes of salvage surgery per 1000 patients, but the true effect could lie between 33 to 96 more episodes per 1000 patients. Interval (symptomatic) recurrences: these were less frequent with intensive follow-up (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; I² = 66%; moderate-quality evidence). There were 376 interval recurrences reported in 3933 participants enrolled in seven studies. Intensive follow-up was associated with fewer interval recurrences (52 fewer per 1000 patients); the true effect is between 18 and 75 fewer per 1000 patients. Intensive follow-up probably makes little or no difference to quality of life, anxiety, or depression (reported in 7 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The data were not available in a form that allowed analysis. Intensive follow-up may increase the complications (perforation or haemorrhage) from colonoscopies (OR 7.30, 95% CI 0.75 to 70.69; 1 study, 326 participants; very low-quality evidence). Two studies reported seven colonoscopic complications in 2292 colonoscopies, three perforations and four gastrointestinal haemorrhages requiring transfusion. We could not combine the data, as they were not reported by study arm in one study. The limited data on costs suggests that the cost of more intensive follow-up may be increased in comparison with less intense follow-up (low-quality evidence). The data were not available in a form that allowed analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review suggest that there is no overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Although more participants were treated with salvage surgery with curative intent in the intensive follow-up groups, this was not associated with improved survival. Harms related to intensive follow-up and salvage therapy were not well reported.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^0031cb38]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The number of studies reporting long-term outcomes of high-risk children is rapidly increasing. However, the methods of these follow-up studies vary widely, with sources of variability including inclusion criteria, timing of assessments, outcome measures and use of appropriate control groups. As a result, it is difficult to compare the results of published studies, or to aggregate the data to provide more certainty around the rates of some important outcomes. Outcome statistics are needed for counseling families as well as to guide practitioners who follow high risk groups to know what outcomes can be expected and at what ages specific problems may emerge. This information can also be linked to evidence-based pathways to assist families to access management resources.

While it is widely accepted that high-risk infants need close monitoring and surveillance, a framework for this practice has only infrequently been developed; for example in one instance for a selected group of infants over the first 5 years of life. In addition to being useful for informing clinical follow-up programs, a framework could also assist longitudinal research with high-risk infants and help to improve uniformity of follow-up time-points and measures. The aim of this report is to provide a framework for identifying which children need specialised follow-up, what outcomes should or could be of interest, in addition to how, where and when follow-up should be conducted.

### Is GP-led follow-up feasible? [^6bb00ea1]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

During the last decennium, follow-up of cancer patients has been a major topic in oncology research. In melanoma, the need and benefit of follow-up has been discussed for many years and for several reasons. The incidence of melanoma is increasing, but without any increase in the mortality rate. Consequently, the prevalence of melanoma is rising, with more melanoma patients in follow-up. Melanoma patients are reasonably young, and those who do not suffer from metastatic disease are often in a remarkably good condition because the initial melanoma treatment does not often dramatically impair patients' physical functioning. Furthermore, the risk of recurrence is generally small (About 66% of melanoma cases at primary diagnosis are stage 1a or 1b and have a 10-year survival rate of more than 90 and 80%, respectively.) and lastly, currently no definite therapeutic options are known once the metastatic disease presents.

The goal of melanoma follow-up is early detection of 'curable' disease, local recurrences, intransit metastases or nodal disease. Is an intensive melanoma follow-up schedule justified to reach this goal? Additional questions are (1) What do patients need in terms of follow-up?; (2) What kind of follow-up is sensible and can be offered?

Looking at the available literature, several aspects are of importance. No international consensus exists on how melanoma patients should be followed up after primary diagnosis, nor on the frequency of clinical visits, on the duration of follow-up or on which type of health-care professional to be consulted. There seems to be consensus only on omitting routine tests in follow-up, although some argue even on this aspect.

### Follow-up strategies for patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer [^b37f040c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is common clinical practice to follow patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for several years following their definitive surgery and/or adjuvant therapy. Despite this widespread practice there is considerable controversy about how often patients should be seen, what tests should be performed and whether these varying strategies have any significant impact on patient outcomes.

Objectives

To review the available evidence concerning the benefits of intensive follow up of colorectal cancer patients with respect to survival. Secondary endpoints include time to diagnosis of recurrence, quality of life and the harms and costs of surveillance and investigations.

Search Strategy

Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Science Citation Index, conference proceedings, trial registers, reference lists and contact with experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials comparing different follow-up strategies for patients with non-metastatic CRC treated with curative intent were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial eligibility and methodological quality were assessed independently by the three authors.

Main Results

Eight studies were included in this update of the review. There was evidence that an overall survival benefit at five years exists for patients undergoing more intensive follow up OR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.91); and RD -0.06 (95% CI -0.11 to -0.02). The absolute number of recurrences was similar; OR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.10); and RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.02) and although the weighted mean difference for the time to recurrence was significantly reduced by -6.75 (95% CI -11.06 to -2.44) there was significant heterogeneity between the studies. Analyses demonstrated a mortality benefit for performing more tests versus fewer tests OR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), and RD -0.09 (95%CI -0.14 to -0.03) and liver imaging versus no liver imaging OR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), and RD -0.09 (95%CI -0.14 to -0.03). There were significantly more curative surgical procedures attempted in the intensively followed arm: OR 2.41(95% CI 1.63 to 3.54), RD 0.06 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.09). No useful data on quality of life, harms or cost-effectiveness were available for further analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. Nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. Large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^d7ffef56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Contraceptive implant routine follow-up — these recommendations address when routine follow-up is needed for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy patients, noting that specific populations who might benefit more from frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, those with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and those with multiple medical conditions. Advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss side effects or other problems, if they want to change the method being used, and when it is time to remove or replace the contraceptive method, and no routine follow-up visit is required. At other routine visits, health care providers seeing implant users should assess the patient's satisfaction with their contraceptive method and whether they have any concerns about method use, and assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of the implant for safe and effective continued use on the basis of U.S. MEC (e.g., category 3 and 4 conditions).

### Alternative methods of follow up in breast cancer: a systematic review of the literature [^e12ece0b]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Regular follow up of patients after treatment for breast cancer is a common practice. Aims of follow up include early detection of treatable local recurrence, detection and treatment of side effects of therapy and psychological support in the aftermath of diagnosis and treatment.

Although it is generally felt that some form of follow up is required, it is not clear what form it should take. Multiple diagnostic interventions designed to detect metastatic disease are now no longer recommended. These do not prolong survival and are considered to have a detrimental effect on the quality of life. The only investigation now conducted routinely is mammography, which has been shown to detect contralateral disease at an earlier stage than clinical examination alone.

In addition to mammography, most clinicians recommend routine clinic visits for history and clinical examination. However, recommended frequency and duration of visits vary. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends clinical examination 3–6 monthly for 3 years, 6–12 monthly for a further 2 years and then annually. In contrast, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England advocates follow up for only 2 or 3 years and gives no advice on how frequently visits should be conducted.

These marked variations in practice stem from a lack of evidence that routine clinical examination is of benefit. The NICE guidelines cite only one study, a retrospective review of 643 patients with median follow up of 3 years and 11 months, as evidence for their recommendations for routine follow up.

A recent systematic review designed to investigate long-term outcomes in the setting of routine clinical follow up failed to identify any trials comparing long-term results (survival/disease-free survival) in patients with clinically detected local recurrence vs symptomatic presentation of local recurrence. The authors were unable to comment on whether routine clinical examination during follow up conferred any survival benefit. However, they did report that routine clinics following the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines would detect only four asymptomatic recurrences in every 100 women over 10 years of follow up, and would lead to delayed diagnosis in two women who would notice problems but wait for their next clinic appointment. A recent simulation model has also suggested that the survival benefit of follow up would be at best marginal.

### Alternative methods of follow up in breast cancer: a systematic review of the literature [^c6990d6b]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

The current recommendations for follow up are inconsistent. This systematic review of the literature highlights the underlying reasons for the limitations in the recommendations.

There are no randomised trials in the literature with sufficient power to recommend an acceptable frequency or duration of follow up. Moreover, there are no randomised trials, which can confirm the safety of using alternative follow-up methods. Those studies, which have been conducted have not suggested that alternative methods are any less safe than routine clinical follow up, but recruitment and duration are such that the only conclusion, which can be made is that the necessity for clinical examination and the safety of alternative follow up has not been proven.

Traditional routine clinic visits are an inefficient way of safeguarding against recurrent disease, and there is doubt as to whether they provide the ideal setting for providing psychological support to patients. Alternative follow-up methods are acceptable to patients, are associated with no reduction in the quality of life or increase in anxiety and may be conducted with significant economic and time savings.

More high-quality, randomised controlled trials in this area are required in order to establish how best to provide effective psychosocial support to patients after treatment of breast cancer, while at the same time maintaining adequate surveillance to detect those few treatable relapses which occur.

Clinicians involved in the care of breast cancer patients need to be clear about what their objectives are regarding follow up after breast cancer, both in their own minds and to their patients. Only then can we design and evaluate efficient follow-up programmes to meet those objectives, while at the same time providing patients with a realistic view of what we are trying to achieve.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: executive summary of the 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^5064211c]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory monitoring, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to ensure adherence to a well-defined treatment plan to achieve good outcomes with therapy. Obtain regular clinical assessments and implement a broadly supportive approach, team-based if possible, to achieve good adherence. Increase monitoring frequency in patients with suspected nonadherence.

### Alternative methods of follow up in breast cancer: a systematic review of the literature [^c33ce058]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

It is clear that most retrospective reviews of routine clinic visits have not been helpful in establishing either the best schedule for such visits, or indeed whether such visits are necessary. However, the available evidence does appear to suggest that the impact of routine follow up on survival will be at best marginal and may lead to delayed diagnosis of recurrence.

The optimal design to study this issue would be a randomised trial. Comparisons of different frequencies of visits to clinic or different durations of follow up would be of particular value in informing guidelines. Comparisons of traditional follow up with novel methods of care would help to establish whether traditional clinic visits were necessary. It is the intention of this review to identify any alternative methods of follow up, which has been proposed and subjected to randomised trial. In addition, we intend to establish whether there is any randomised, controlled evidence to suggest an ideal length or schedule of follow up in order to reconcile the various guidelines described above.

### Follow-up paradigms for stable aortic dissection [^f2f22840]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

While limited data exist on which follow-up paradigms for chronic aortic dissections can be based, what information is present suggests that long-term follow-up is mandatory. In spite of the treatment modality, deaths from aortic disease continue to accrue and repeat interventions are often required over long-term follow-up. The only prospective trial data available indicate a roughly equal incidence of secondary interventions during the first and second year. Recent studies with longer follow-up suggest that the likelihood of a need for intervention ultimately diminishes. With increasing time after presentation, it may be possible to decrease the frequency of follow-up interrogations. Definitive recommendations in this regard, however, must await the availability of longer-term data.

### How often Do patients with localized melanoma attend follow-up at a specialist center? [^d261c8e4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Post-treatment follow-up for patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I/II melanoma is believed to be important for early detection of disease recurrence and new primary melanomas, but comes with costs to both patients and healthcare providers. We aimed to determine how frequently a cohort of patients attended follow-up after surgical treatment at one Specialist Center.

Methods

We used prospectively collected data from the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) for patients with AJCC stage I/II melanoma diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2011. The distribution of the number of recorded follow-up visits per patient was analyzed and compared with the number of follow-up visits recommended in the 2008 Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Management Guidelines.

Results

A total of 3813 patients with stage I/II melanoma were identified. During the first year of follow-up post-surgery, 34% of stage I patients and 14% of stage II patients had the number of follow-up visits recommended in the guidelines. A large proportion of melanoma patients did not appear to be routinely followed up at MIA, with 43.2% of stage I patients and 28.7% of stage II patients having either no visit or only one visit post-surgery. During all years of follow-up, 13.2% of stage I patients and 4.1% of stage II patients had the number of follow-up visits at the specialist center as recommended in the guidelines.

Conclusions

The large proportion of patients who had fewer follow-up visits than expected suggests (i) many patients are followed up in clinics elsewhere, and/or (ii) post-surgical surveillance is less frequent in practice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism | NEJM resident 360… [^91fb23a6]. resident360.nejm.org (2018). Low credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published June 20, 2018 The causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism are the same as the causes of overt hyperthyroidism. The potential clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism include progression to overt hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular conditions, bone loss, fractures, and dementia. Listen to the latest Clinical Practice Audio here. Levels of free T 4 and T 3 should be promptly assessed in patients with a serum thyrotropin level of less than 0. 1 mU per liter to rule out overt hyperthyroidism. In the absence of overt disease, it is reasonable to defer further evaluation for 2 to 3 months, at which time repeat testing should be performed; subnormal serum thyrotropin levels are transient in up to 50% of patients, most often in those with mild disease. Q: What is thebest predictor of progression from subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

A: The best predictor of progression from subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism is the baseline serum thyrotropin level rather than the cause of the disease. Serum thyrotropin levels in patients with mild subclinical hyperthyroidism frequently normalize during follow-up, whereas patients with thyrotropin levels lower than 0. 1 mU per liter usually have persistent disease or progression to overt hyperthyroidism. Patients with nodular thyroid disease and subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for progression to overt hyperthyroidism after exposure to a large iodine load. A: Although data are lacking from randomized clinical trials to guide treatment decisions, professional organizations recommend treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism in persons older than 65 years of age and postmenopausal women, especially when serum thyrotropin levels are less than 0. 1 mU per liter.

Premenopausal women and younger patients should be considered for treatment if serum thyrotropin levels are less than 0. 1 mU per liter and they have symptoms of hyperthyroidism or coexisting conditions such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, or cardiovascular disease. There is no indication for treatment in younger patients who do not have coexisting conditions if the serum thyrotropin level is 0. 1 mU per liter or higher.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^f26a5798]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The current follow‐up in The Netherlands consists of annual follow‐up visits in the hospital for a minimum of 5 years, with clinical examination and mammography [3]. This is comparable to follow‐up schedules in other countries, such as the U.K. [11], Australia [12] and the U.S. [13]. Dutch recommendations on the monitoring after 5 years of follow‐up are based on consensus. The age after 5 years of follow‐up determines the schedule: women < 60 years will continue with annual visits and those between the ages of 60 and 75 biennial visits (in the population‐based screening program), whereas for those > 75 years, the guideline suggests to consider stopping follow‐up. With these age‐based recommendations, implicit assumptions are made as to what level of risk is appropriate for which frequency of follow‐up visits. It is uncertain whether the recommendations capture the differences of developing an LRR or SP between the age groups after 5 years. Ideally, risk groups should clearly differentiate in risk and the frequency of follow‐up visits should match the risk of recurrence, with higher‐risk patients receiving more follow‐up visits, unless the abovementioned lack of value of follow‐up becomes translated into practice.

Women without a history of breast cancer aged 50–75 years are invited by the national breast cancer screening program to undergo biennial screening. It is unclear how the risk for primary breast cancer in the healthy screening population and the corresponding recommendations relate to women with a history of breast cancer who are at risk for recurrence and are advised annual, biennial, or no hospital follow‐up. When examining the patterns in the risk of recurrence, risk thresholds could be identified and support evidence‐based follow‐up decisions.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze long‐term breast cancer recurrence patterns and determine how the current age‐based recommendations on the follow‐up schedules after 5 years correspond to the actual risk of LRR and SP. Moreover, alternative age cutoffs are proposed, and risk of LRR or SP was compared with the risk of breast cancer in the general screening population aged 50–74 years.

### Alternative methods of follow up in breast cancer: a systematic review of the literature [^6d813539]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Regular clinical follow up after breast cancer is a common practice. Evidence from retrospective reviews casts doubt on the efficacy of this practice and the various guidelines for follow up show little concordance. Our aim was to investigate what alternative follow-up methods (including reduced frequency of visits) have been subjected to controlled trial and to establish what evidence exists from controlled trials to advise the guidelines. The study involved systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, Embase, CancerLit, Web of Sciences and EBM reviews as data sources. Methods included reviewing all randomised controlled trials comparing different follow-up frequencies or comparing an alternative method with clinical follow up after breast cancer. All outcome measures addressed in the trials were analysed. Two trials compared frequency of traditional follow up. Five trials assessed alternative methods. All were of inadequate power or duration to establish ideal frequency of clinic visits or safety of alternative follow-up methods. Alternative follow up had no detrimental effect on satisfaction or outcome. Few trials have been conducted, all of which are underpowered to establish safety of reducing or replacing clinic visits. Alternative methods of follow up are acceptable to patients and may be associated with other benefits. Larger trials are required.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^b15bf8a7]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current consensus‐based follow‐up recommendations after 5 years (annual for < 60 years after 5 years of follow‐up, biennial for 60–74, consider stopping > 74) use suboptimal age cutoffs leading to an imbalance between risk of LRR and SP and intensity of the follow‐up following the 5 years of clinical follow‐up. Patients aged 50–60 years have a lower risk for recurrence compared with patients < 50 and could have a less intensive schedule. The proposed alternative cutoffs (< 50, 50–69, > 69) will lead to a more balanced risk‐based follow‐up frequency taking into account the risk of both LRR and SP and will be a start toward more efficient allocation of resources. However, to get truly personalized follow‐up, more risk factors as well as the benefits and harms of follow‐up should be taken into account to provide accurate individualized risk estimates and follow‐up schedules.

### Recurrent prostate cancer following external beam radiotherapy: follow-up strategies and management [^5752cf09]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

All patients who undergo curative therapy for prostate cancer should be followed for a prolonged period of time to determine tumor control and treatment toxicity for quality assurance purposes. Follow-up duties may be reasonably shared between the oncologist and the family doctor or urologist: however, it is probable that some follow-up information specific to the irradiated patient will be lost unless the oncologist maintains regular contact with the patient, especially in the first 5 years of follow-up when late radiation effects are most likely to appear. There is no strong evidence that patients stop being at risk for recurrence at any time after treatment, and because PSA testing is an accurate, simple, and inexpensive method of determining post-RT tumor status, it is recommended that periodic PSA measurements be continued for life. In the absence of a rising PSA, all other tests and visits are unnecessary to determine post-RT tumor control. Because DRE has been shown to be of limited utility in follow-up of irradiated patients, it should be possible to effectively follow patients remotely. This could be done by asking patients to have PSA tests done, forward the results to their physicians, and report treatment toxicity when it occurs. Only abnormal results would trigger an office visit. This strategy is being evaluated in clinical trials. The alternative is to delegate the follow-up to the primary-care physician with guidelines as to when referral back is required. Follow-up frequency, and the most beneficial follow-up investigations vary from scenario to scenario, and are influenced by the likelihood of relapse, time to relapse, and planned intervention. These decisions are influenced in turn by the initial presentation — either with high or low risk factors — and by the patient's general state of health at completion of EBRT. Effective follow-up also requires active patient cooperation that only can be achieved after discussion of the goals of follow-up with the patient and with the patient's full understanding of the process. The follow-up strategy proposed in Fig. 1 is most suitable for a fit patient with low or intermediate risk factors who wishes to consider all salvage options should he relapse, or for the high-risk individual in situations in which the probability of systemic relapse is of major concern. Young patients with very adverse risk factors may benefit from even closer follow-up in the early years after EBRT and the elderly or frail may require only occasional visits to record or treat treatment toxicity and to ensure clinical non-progression.

### Follow-up and surveillance of the patient with lung cancer after curative-intent therapy: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d73f9178]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Summary of other published guidelines — non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) follow-up after curative-intent therapy emphasizes a patient-centered approach, frequent early visits, and variable use of imaging. A patient-centered approach mandates considering patient preferences; patients view clinic follow-up favorably with nurse-led care acceptable, whereas primary-care or telephone follow-up is viewed less favorably. Prior guidance uniformly recommended frequent follow-up during the first 2 years after curative-intent therapy but noted a wide divergence of views on chest imaging. From 2010 to 2011, four additional guidelines reinforced early surveillance within 6 weeks after therapy with routinely scheduled visits focused on clinical signs/symptoms and smoking cessation interventions.

### Quantification of the completeness of follow-up [^495820c3]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Completeness of follow-up is important, especially in clinical trials, since unequal follow-up in the treatment groups can bias the analysis of results. In survival studies, information on participants who do not complete the study is often omitted because their data can be included up to the time at which they were lost to follow-up. We propose a simple measure of completeness that is the ratio of the total observed person-time and the potential person-time of follow-up in a study. Our measure is easy to calculate, can be illustrated pictorially, and can be used to identify subgroups with especially poor follow-up.

### Follow-up care, surveillance protocol, and secondary prevention measures for survivors of colorectal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline endorsement [^fdf9b443]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing recent clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations.

Methods

The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Guideline on Follow-up Care, Surveillance Protocol, and Secondary Prevention Measures for Survivors of Colorectal Cancer was reviewed by ASCO for methodologic rigor and considered for endorsement.

Results

The ASCO Panel concurred with the CCO recommendations and recommended endorsement, with the addition of several qualifying statements.

Conclusion

Surveillance should be guided by presumed risk of recurrence and functional status of the patient (important within the first 2 to 4 years). Medical history, physical examination, and carcinoembryonic antigen testing should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence should be considered for testing in the more frequent end of the range. A computed tomography scan (abdominal and chest) is recommended annually for 3 years, in most cases. Positron emission tomography scans should not be used for surveillance outside of a clinical trial. A surveillance colonoscopy should be performed 1 year after the initial surgery and then every 5 years, dictated by the findings of the previous one. If a colonoscopy was not preformed before diagnosis, it should be done after completion of adjuvant therapy (before 1 year). Secondary prevention (maintaining a healthy body weight and active lifestyle) is recommended. If a patient is not a candidate for surgery or systemic therapy because of severe comorbid conditions, surveillance tests should not be performed. A treatment plan from the specialist should have clear directions on appropriate follow-up by a nonspecialist.

### Colorectal cancer follow-up in 2005 [^2df3fcf9]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The main goal in monitoring patients after the treatment of colorectal cancer is to improve survival through the early identification and treatment of metastatic or locally recurrent disease. Although the results of several randomized, controlled trials have identified a survival benefit associated with careful follow-up, specific testing strategies to maximize survival while minimizing cost and patient inconvenience have not been identified. There is, therefore, great variability in the types, number, and frequency of tests ordered to follow these patients. This article reviews the level-I data avail-able regarding the efficacy of follow-up, the specific tests commonly used, and issues of costs and patient satisfaction, and provides a summary of the available societal guidelines concerning colorectal cancer follow-up.

### Consensus and controversies regarding follow-up after treatment with curative intent of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer: a synopsis of guidelines used in countries represented in the European Society of Coloproctology [^36b5e8f3]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

It is common clinical practice to follow patients for a period of years after treatment with curative intent of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, but follow-up strategies vary widely. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of recommendations on this topic in guidelines from member countries of the European Society of Coloproctology, with supporting evidence.

Method

A systematic search of Medline, Embase and the guideline databases Trip database, BMJ Best Practice and Guidelines International Network was performed. Quality assessment included use of the AGREE-II tool. All topics with recommendations from included guidelines were identified and categorized. For each subtopic, a conclusion was made followed by the degree of consensus and the highest level of evidence.

Results

Twenty-one guidelines were included. The majority recommended that structured follow-up should be offered, except for patients in whom treatment of recurrence would be inappropriate. It was generally agreed that clinical visits, measurement of carcinoembryoinc antigen and liver imaging should be part of follow-up, based on a high level of evidence, although the frequency is controversial. There was also consensus on imaging of the chest and pelvis in rectal cancer, as well as endoscopy, based on lower levels of evidence and with a level of intensity that was contradictory.

Conclusion

In available guidelines, multimodal follow-up after treatment with curative intent of colorectal cancer is widely recommended, but the exact content and intensity are highly controversial. International agreement on the optimal follow-up schedule is unlikely to be achieved on current evidence, and further research should refocus on individualized 'patient-driven' follow-up and new biomarkers.

### Follow-up care for men with prostate cancer and the role of primary care: a systematic review of international guidelines [^805551a2]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to review prostate cancer guidelines systematically and to summarise international guideline recommendations on follow-up. Although monitoring PSA remains the cornerstone of follow-up for men with prostate cancer, the diversity of guideline recommendations on the frequency and duration of PSA testing, and components of follow-up other than PSA testing, reflects the current lack of research evidence on which to base firm conclusions. The guidelines provide only broad frameworks for evaluating potential intervention models of follow-up care, particularly in terms of the setting and the composition of the health-care team.

In conducting this review, we had a specific interest in the role of primary care in prostate cancer follow-up. The included guidelines illustrate the disagreement that persists on the extent to which primary care should be involved. The recommendations in recent guidelines that highlight primary-care-based follow-up would require considerable effort and investment to implement – in terms of education, protocols and strategies to change established practice. Furthermore, cancer follow-up in the community requires a close cooperation between primary and secondary care services. However, there has been little research on the best way to manage processes of care involving related actions and decisions by different care providers and, as this review shows, practice guidelines seldom address implementation. Guidelines recommending follow-up in the community give only general guidance, such as agreeing shared care protocols, maintaining close contact between all professionals involved and having mechanisms in place to allow primary care providers access to specialist services. With the current focus on integrated models of chronic care, there are, again, limitations on the usefulness of existing guidelines.

### Follow-up after surgical treatment of bladder cancer: a critical analysis of the literature [^7fe86d07]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Follow-up of patients treated for bladder cancer (BCa) is of great importance for both non-muscle-invasive BCa (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BCa (MIBC) because of the high incidence of recurrence and progression. The schedule and methods of follow-up should reflect the individual clinical situation.

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence for intensity and duration of follow-up recommendations in patients after surgical treatment of BCa.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for published data on the follow-up of patients with NMIBC and MIBC after radical cystectomy (RC).

Evidence Synthesis

Follow-up in patients with NMIBC is necessary because of the high probability of tumour recurrence and the risk of progression. Cystoscopy plus cytology are the standard methods for follow-up. Cystoscopy should be done 3 mo after the transurethral resection in every patient, and the frequency after that depends on the individual recurrence/progression risk. Cytology should be used as an adjunctive method to cystoscopy in intermediate- and high-risk patients. None of the currently available urinary markers or imaging methods can substitute for cystoscopy-based follow-up. High-risk NMIBC patients require regular lifelong upper urinary tract monitoring. Follow-up in MIBC is based on the fact that early detection of recurrence after RC allows for timely treatment with the aim of improving outcomes. Patients with extravesical and lymph node-positive disease should have the most intensive follow-up because of the highest recurrence risk. Routine upper urinary tract imaging is advisable for all patients and should continue in the long term. Follow-up also allows for early detection of urinary diversion-related complications, the rate of which increases with time.

Conclusions

Follow-up in BCa is necessary for diagnosing recurrence and progression, as well as for evaluating complications after radical treatment. Since randomised studies investigating the most appropriate follow-up schedule are lacking, most recommendations are based on only the retrospective experience. Nonetheless, reasonable recommendations can be made until further prospective randomised studies testing different follow-up schedules have been performed.

For this 2014 review update, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (4 July 2014), MEDLINE (4 July 2014), Embase (4 July 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (4 July 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (4 July 2014). References from retrieved articles were also checked.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up after primary treatment were reviewed for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility for inclusion in the review and risk of bias. Data were pooled in an individual patient data meta-analysis for the two RCTs testing the effectiveness of different follow-up schemes. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, tumour size and lymph node status.

Main Results

Since 2000, one new trial has been published; the updated review now includes five RCTs involving 4023 women with breast cancer (clinical stage I, II or III). Two trials involving 2563 women compared follow-up based on clinical visits and mammography with a more intensive scheme including radiological and laboratory tests. After pooling the data, no significant differences in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15, two studies, 2563 participants, high-quality evidence), or disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00, two studies, 2563 participants, low-quality evidence) emerged. No differences in overall survival and disease-free survival emerged in subgroup analyses according to patient age, tumour size and lymph node status before primary treatment. In 1999, 10-year follow-up data became available for one trial of these trials, and no significant differences in overall survival were found. No difference was noted in quality of life measures (one study, 639 participants, high-quality evidence). The new included trial, together with a previously included trial involving 1264 women compared follow-up performed by a hospital-based specialist versus follow-up performed by general practitioners. No significant differences were noted in overall survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78, one study, 968 participants, moderate-quality evidence), time to detection of recurrence (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.47, two studies, 1264 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and quality of life (one study, 356 participants, high-quality evidence). Patient satisfaction was greater among patients treated by general practitioners. One RCT involving 196 women compared regularly scheduled follow-up visits versus less frequent visits restricted to the time of mammography. No significant differences emerged in interim use of telephone and frequency of general practitioners's consultations.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review of RCTs conducted almost 20 years ago suggests that follow-up programs based on regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive approaches based on regular performance of laboratory and instrumental tests in terms of timeliness of recurrence detection, overall survival and quality of life. In two RCTs, follow-up care performed by trained and not trained general practitioners working in an organised practice setting had comparable effectiveness to that delivered by hospital-based specialists in terms of overall survival, recurrence detection, and quality of life.

### Monitoring of patients with COPD: a review of current guidelines' recommendations [^61bf1551]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The goals for the management of COPD are to delay the process of disease progression and alleviate its manifestations. The follow-up of the patients' physical and mental condition is part of best practice management when monitoring routines results in information that contributes to the achievement of management goals. However, the recommendations on monitoring procedures may differ between guidelines and may not be based on scientific evidence. The aim of this article is to review the current guideline recommendations on monitoring routines for COPD.

Methods

Clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were identified by a Medline search, Internet search and expanded by experts in the respiratory field. Guidelines on the management of COPD were analysed on recommended monitoring routines, recommended frequency of monitoring.

Results

Eighteen clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were analysed. The follow-up of lung function indices was the most frequently recommended monitoring routine. Moreover, monitoring of symptoms, exercise tolerance, comorbidity, and smoking habits were recommended regularly. In none of the guidelines, the recommended monitoring routines were evidence based. Only one guideline provides a different set of monitoring parameters for advanced COPD compared to mild and moderate COPD.

Conclusion

Some monitoring routines were recommended frequently, especially follow-up of lung function indices. However, evidence to support the guideline recommendations for the monitoring of patients with COPD is missing. The effect of monitoring on care process and outcomes should be assessed.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^f572bb96]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) — follow-up and imaging: Patients with FMD should be seen in follow-up at least annually, and follow-up includes clinical assessment, assessment of renal function (for renal artery FMD), and imaging. Evaluation should also include measurement of blood pressure and vascular physical examination, assessment of adherence to medical therapy (particularly to an antiplatelet agent and medications for treatment of hypertension) with potential adverse reactions, and education on warning signs and symptoms of TIA, stroke, and arterial dissection with need to seek immediate medical care. For patients with renal artery involvement, blood chemistries for renal function and serum electrolytes should be monitored at least annually, with periodic urinalysis to screen for albuminuria in patients with other concomitant risk factors. At this time, there is insufficient data to recommend specific algorithms for modality and frequency of imaging studies in the follow-up of FMD, and the timing of follow-up imaging should be customized to each patient's pattern and severity of disease, including the need for monitoring of aneurysms or dissections or following revascularization, as well as local imaging resources and experience. Patients who have undergone revascularization procedures may require more frequent imaging surveillance, particularly within the 2 years following the procedure.

### Surveillance as a management strategy for retained third molars: is it desirable? [^57322422]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present report was to define and advocate active surveillance compared with follow-up as needed (prn follow-up), as the preferred management strategy for patients who elect to retain their third molars (M3s). Active surveillance, a nonoperative management strategy for retained M3s, is characterized as a prescribed, regularly scheduled set of follow-up visits that include both clinical and radiographic examinations. Given that the risk of complications with M3 removal are age related, the rationale for recommending active surveillance instead of "prn follow-up" is that the frequency of future disease among retained M3s is sufficiently high to warrant routine scheduled follow-up visits to detect and treat disease before it becomes symptomatic. Symptomatic disease is a late finding. Patients electing active surveillance as their preferred management strategy might not avoid operative treatment in the future, but it should increase their chances of being diagnosed at the youngest age possible, thus minimizing the age-related operative complications. The author recommends that the frequency of follow-up visits be approximately every 24 months and the examination be completed by a specialist or general dentist. Active surveillance as a management strategy is based on level 5 evidence (ie, expert opinion).

### Current trends risks associated with human parvovirus B19 infection… [^59dc8878]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Reappearance of the rash may occur for several weeks following nonspecific stimuli such as change in temperature, sunlight, and emotional stress. Typically, the patient is otherwise well at rash onset but often gives a history of mild systemic symptoms 1–4 days before rash onset. In some EI outbreaks, pruritis has been a common clinical feature. Few patients with TAC report a rash. In the acute phase of the illness, patients usually have a moderate to severe anemia with absence f reticulocytes, and bone marrow examination shows a hypoplastic or an aplastic erythroid series with a normal myeloid series. Recovery is indicated by a return of reticulocytes in the peripheral smear approximately 7–10 days after their disappearance. The virus is transmitted effectively after close contact exposures. The secondary attack rate for infection among susceptible household contacts of patients with TAC or EI is about 50%. In school outbreaks, 10%-60% of students may develop EI.

In outbreaks in which student involvement is widespread, preliminary data suggest 20%-30% of susceptible staff may develop serologic evidence of B19 infection during the course of the outbreak. Transmission rarely occurs during transfusion with single-donor blood products but is common during treatment with clotting-factor concentrates even after steam- or dry-heat treatment of the clotting factor concentrate. Tattooing was suspected as the source of B19 transmission in two instances. DIAGNOSIS B19 Antibody Assays The most sensitive test to detect recent infection is the IgM-antibody assay. B19 IgM antibody can be detected by capture-antibody radioimmunoassay or enzyme immunoassay in approximately 90% of cases by the third day after symptoms of TAC or EI begin. The titer and the percentage of positives begin to decline 30–60 days after onset.

B19 IgG antibody is usually present by the seventh day of illness and persists for years. B19 antibody may not be detectable in immunodeficient patients with chronic B19 infection, and additional testing for B19 DNA or viral antigens may be necessary to document infection. B19 has not been grown in standard cell culture systems or animal model systems, but it has been grown in bone marrow explant culture systems.

Small cell lung cancer — follow-up and surveillance imaging schedules: Most NCCN Member Institutions use chest CT ± abdomen/pelvis every 2–6 months (more frequently in years 1–2 and less frequently thereafter). Brain MRI or CT with contrast is obtained every 3–4 months during year 1, then every 6 months in year 2, then after year 2, as clinically indicated (regardless of PCI status). Surveillance for all patients consists of CT chest ± abdomen/pelvis and brain MRI (preferred) or brain CT. Imaging for known metastases (eg, CT neck or MRI spine) should be repeated for follow-up, other imaging studies may be obtained based on individual clinical scenarios, a new pulmonary nodule should initiate workup for potential new primary, and FDG-PET/CT is not recommended for routine follow-up unless a contrast CT or MRI is contraindicated.

Closing remarks

The presented guideline is the first international and evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of CG, and aimed to be applicable worldwide. This guideline should serve as a guide for clinicians and other experts caring for patients with CG. Though great effort was undertaken to formulate evidence-based recommendations, this was frequently hampered by limited evidence resulting in numerous recommendations based on expert opinion (18/40 recommendations, 45%). The literature concerning CG available to date mostly consists of studies with an observational study-design. In the current era of evidence-based medicine these studies are labeled as having a low to very low level of evidence. Therefore strength of recommendation is 'discretionary' for a majority of recommendations in the guidelines, (32/40 recommendations, 80%) including the recommendations labeled expert opinion. However, as other study designs (such as RCTs or cohort studies) are usually not feasible or may not provide the best design to study characteristics of rare diseases, the strength of the recommendation was upgraded to 'strong' when results were consistent across multiple studies, and experts had confidence in the validity of these results (9/40 recommendations, 23%).

Future perspectives

Following this conclusion, it is not unexpected that gaps of knowledge were identified in most discussed fields of interest, foremost in the fields of treatment and follow-up. Topics of major importance for future research include: further assessment of which patients should be treated (cut-off enzyme activity), exploration for possible further relaxation of the diet for patients after childhood, exploration of new biomarkers for biochemical follow-up as well as reproductive function, assessment of executive functions in children and adults, and further exploration of bone turnover markers in relation to BMD.

Guideline update

Revision of this guideline is important as it only represents evidence in predefined areas up to October 2015. Since research in the field of CG is flourishing, it is expected that new information will be gained in the next decade. This guideline is scheduled to be updated in the next 10 years by representatives of the GalNet.

Conclusion

Programs such as FIND can help improve follow-up rates for incidental imaging findings, including in the emergency room setting, by providing reminders to physicians and patients. This can lead to earlier detection of disease and should be communicated to the patient clearly and with regard for how this may affect a patient's overall well-being. Determination of follow-up of incidental findings ultimately depends on the type and location of finding, the evidence-based guidelines regarding follow-up recommendations, and individual patient preferences.

### Follow-up care for men with prostate cancer and the role of primary care: a systematic review of international guidelines [^46d1c6d2]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This review shows the current status of international guidelines in prostate cancer follow-up. The variability in recommendations to some extent reflects the lack of definitive evidence from research in this field. Choices over management in prostate cancer, including follow-up, can only be informed to a limited extent by evidence from high-quality trials.

The review illustrates the importance of rigorous and transparent guideline development processes when research evidence is limited, without which it is difficult to assess factors such as independence and impartiality. It also highlights the need for robust primary research to improve the evidence base for prostate cancer follow-up – particularly research to inform best practice models of care. Only then can the many new models of care emerging internationally be shaped in a rational, evidence-based way.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^a48d535d]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, current guidelines recommend repeat evaluation of a benign thyroid nodule after 1–2 years, which is only based on expert opinion. This study suggests that this recommendation can be safely extended to 3 years without increased malignancy and mortality risk, or likelihood of harm. Nodule growth can be expected, and therefore young patients, those experiencing possible structural symptoms, or those with larger nodules at baseline may be candidates for modified recommendations. Conversely, even longer follow-up intervals should be considered for older patients with predominantly cystic nodules. While replication of these data in large prospective multicenter studies is needed, this extension in follow-up interval would reduce unnecessary visits and medical interventions for millions of affected patients worldwide, leading to healthcare savings.

Availability of data and materials

These data are not publicly available as these concern patient-related data.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^3053d771]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

A simple example of thresholds would be to use the cumulative incidence levels after 5 years of follow‐up of the newly defined groups based on the alternative age cutoffs (Fig. 3A) as risk thresholds for the follow‐up frequency (annual, biennial, or consider stopping hospital follow‐up). Subsequently, cumulative incidence level of the complete population during the first 5 years (5.74%) could be divided in five equal intervals (1.15% per annual visit) and used to determine when a follow‐up visit should take place: instead of set yearly intervals, only when the risk level is reached (Fig. 3B). When projecting these thresholds on two patient profiles based on age (< 50) and endocrine treatment (yes, no), it can be seen that although the two groups receive the same annual follow‐up in practice, the risk of women with endocrine therapy is half that of women without and below the risk level of women aged > 69 (Fig. 3C).

Figure 3
Examples of risk groups to illustrate the imbalance between the risk and recommendations based on age‐related thresholds. (A): Cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and secondary primary tumor (SP) combined over 10 years of follow‐up using the proposed age cutoffs after 5 years and the corresponding recommendations. (B): Cumulative incidence of combined LRR and SP of the entire population to determine equally spaced risk intervals per visit, to propose a follow‐up visit only when the risk level is reached (not at set time periods). (C): Cumulative incidence of LRR and SP combined with 95% confidence intervals for two example risk groups based on age (< 50) and endocrine therapy (yes/no), showing significant differences in risk within one age group. On the cumulative incidence functions, the risk intervals for the first five visits (as depicted in B) are projected. Based on these simple thresholds, the high risk group might benefit from more frequent visits, as it reaches the risk level of the entire population (visit 5) already after 3 years, whereas it takes around 7 years for the lower risk group. However, these thresholds only take into account the risk and current recommendations, not the benefits and harms.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^a004dec8]. PES (2023). High credibility.

General recommendations for use of the simplified guidelines — these long-term follow-up guidelines "are designed to offer general guidance and are not meant to provide or replace the medical advice or judgment of clinicians caring for individual survivors." "The recommendations in Version 6.0 of these Guidelines rely more extensively on history and physical examination and less on screening evaluations, when compared to prior Guideline versions." "We recognize that recommendations for over-screening may occur (primarily due to elimination of radiation dose-cutoffs and simplification of radiation fields); however, additional screening will generally result in recommendations for components of the history and physical examination only." Clinicians are reminded that "not all survivors may be at-risk for all late effects" and that "clinical judgment should be used to guide the individual evaluation." Because some screenings are now based on history and examination, clinicians should "carefully discern which history and physical examination findings should trigger further evaluations," and "additional, more intensive screening and/or diagnostic workup are recommended for any survivors for whom the clinician believes there is reason to suspect the presence of a late effect." Clinicians "are encouraged to modify their recommendations" based on "that survivor's specific therapeutic exposures during treatment and their current clinical status."

### Number of follow-up years needed to identify a rapid decline in FEV [^857626fd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional simulations (not shown) suggest that classification performance is more sensitive to follow-up length in years than to number of follow-up assessments performed (i.e. using 3-year intervals instead of 1-year intervals yielded only slightly lower performance at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 years).

To summarize, our study, which is based on both frequent measurements and long-term follow-up, indicates that with only one spirometry measurement, there is a high risk of falsely ruling out a patient from belonging to a rapid-FEV 1 -decline trajectory. An important message to clinicians is that when meeting a smoking patient, the time frame of follow-up is more important than the number of measurements when it comes to the identification of a rapid-FEV 1 -decline trajectory.

### A systematic review comparing surveillance recommendations for the detection of recurrence following surgery across 16 common cancer types [^b18e88d1]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Future research

We recommend that guideline bodies consider the findings of this review when updating their recommendations (with a focus on providing clear, specific advice that will help limit variation in care); we acknowledge that this is challenging while evidence in this area is lacking. Therefore, we take this opportunity to call for an increase in resources for research to address the lack of evidence that surveillance is beneficial to patients and a good use of healthcare resources. Although most included guidelines recommend lengthy surveillance, many guidelines acknowledge that there is little evidence that this improves long-term outcomes for patients. As recently highlighted, this is in stark contrast to the rigorous evidence required to offer drug-based interventions to patients. The long timeframes required and potential difficulties in patient recruitment make trials of alternative surveillance schedules prohibitively expensive and complex. Some studies, both observationaland trial-based(for melanoma and colorectal cancer respectively), have had success in generating evidence around optimal surveillance schedules; an ongoing UK-based multicentre trialaims to produce evidence about the effect of follow-up on survival in patients after surgery for gastric cancer. However, it is difficult to design a trial when so many aspects of surveillance (modality, frequency, length, risk stratification method) are poorly understood. Ideally, studies would not only assess the ability of surveillance to improve early detection and verify that this is linked to improved survival outcomes but also consider questions about how best to implement risk stratification and the optimal surveillance modalities and schedules for patients at differing risk levels.

We encourage researchers to make use of existing data and to explore a range of methodologies to tackle the challenges and unknowns in this area. As population-scale health data, with many years of retrospective linkage, becomes more widely available, this may be a valuable resource for identifying patients who have received curative treatment for a primary cancer, tracking patient trajectory through follow-up and investigating the long-term association between surveillance and survival. Health economics approaches could be used to improve understanding of the costs of current surveillance to both patient and healthcare systems and probabilistic sensitivity analysis used to identify priority areas for research and data collection. Optimised surveillance strategies developed using observational data could then be used to inform the design of trials. Feasibility studies and pragmatic trials, designed to explore the acceptability and real-world clinical application of alternative surveillance strategies, may provide a suitable starting point, before progressing to more expensive randomised controlled trials. These should be designed to include patient-focused outcomes such as cancer anxiety, worry or fear, and quality of life, where current evidence is particularly poor.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^2cb55324]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Although many patients with breast cancer report reassurance from frequent follow‐up, clinic visits and possible false‐positive tests also cause unwarranted effects such as anxiety [7]. A reduction of unnecessary follow‐up visits can reduce this discomfort, especially in light of the limited evidence on a possible survival benefit. A personalized follow‐up could also reduce unnecessary use of valuable capacity, shorten the waiting lists for diagnostics tests and other services required for follow‐up. The impact of less resource‐intensive follow‐up has already been assessed and found to be cost‐effective, but the differences in the risk of recurrent disease were not considered [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. In this study, we only considered the follow‐up visits aimed at detection of recurrent disease in an early stage. No conclusions can be made based on this study for the visits that offer psychosocial care. When a detected tumor would not have become symptomatic during a woman's lifetime, this is considered overdiagnosis [43]. Overdiagnosis increases in the highest age group, as the risk of death due to other causes also rises. Because mammography is less sensitive and specific in women < 50 years, the net benefit of follow‐up is this age group is probably also lower. However, the longer life expectancy of this group compared with the elderly increases the benefit. Moreover, more sensitive diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging are progressively more used in patients at higher risk for LRR or SP.

### Follow-up after surgical treatment for cancer of the gastrointestinal tract [^73489e66]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Presently, no evidence-based guidelines for the follow-up of patients after surgery for gastrointestinal cancer are available. As a consequence, follow-up strategies may differ between hospitals depending on preference of physicians. We investigated which follow-up procedures are currently employed after surgery for gastrointestinal cancer in the Netherlands.

Method

A questionnaire was sent to all surgical departments in the Netherlands. The questionnaire focused on frequency of follow-up visits and diagnostic procedures after surgical treatment for oesophageal, gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancer and psychosocial issues during follow-up.

Results

The response rate was 90% (83/92). In the majority of hospitals, surgeons treated patients with colorectal (100%) and gastric (96%) cancer in their own centre, whereas patients with pancreatic (64%) and oesophageal (61%) cancer were more often referred to a tertiary centre. For all patients treated for gastrointestinal cancer, three to four follow-up visits were made in the first year, followed by at least two annual visits thereafter. After colorectal surgery, blood tests (78%), colonoscopy (75%) and abdominal ultrasound (57%) were frequently performed. In other gastrointestinal malignancies, procedures were in most cases only performed if symptoms occurred. In almost three-quarters of patients, psychosocial problems were observed, which were dealt with by surgeons in two-thirds of patients. The majority of patients treated for gastrointestinal cancer were pre- and postoperatively discussed in a multidisciplinary setting. Oncologists, gastroenterologists and dieticians were the most frequently consulted specialists after surgery for gastrointestinal cancer.

Conclusion

Patients frequently visit the outpatient clinic after surgery for gastrointestinal cancer in the Netherlands. Whereas follow-up after colorectal cancer surgery focuses on finding recurrent disease and metachronous lesions in the colorectum, this is less clear after oesophageal, gastric and pancreatic cancer surgery. Further studies are needed to establish what is the most effective follow-up protocol after different types of gastrointestinal cancer surgery.

### Assessment of long-term follow-up of randomized trial participants by linkage to routinely collected data: a scoping review and analysis [^fd5b09e4]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Follow-up of participants in randomized trials may be limited by logistic and financial factors. Some important randomized trials have been extended well beyond their original follow-up period by linkage of individual participant information to routinely collected data held in administrative records and registries.

Objective

To perform a scoping review of randomized clinical trials extended by record linkage to characterize this literature and explore any additional insights into treatment effectiveness provided by long-term follow-up using record linkage.

Data Sources

A literature search in Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials was performed for the period January 1, 1945, through November 25, 2016.

Study Selection

Various combinations of search terms were used, as there is no accepted terminology. Determination of study eligibility and extraction of information about trial characteristics and outcomes, for both original and extended trial reports, were performed in duplicate.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Assessment of study eligibility and data extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers. All analyses were descriptive.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes in the pairs of original and extended trials were categorized according to whether any benefits or harms from interventions were sustained, were lost, or emerged during long-term follow-up.

Results

A total of 113 extended trials were included in the study. Linkage to administrative and registry data extended follow-up by between 1 and 55 years. The most common interventions were pharmaceuticals (47 [41.6%]), surgery (19 [16.8%]), and disease screening (19 [16.8%]). End points most frequently studied through record linkage included mortality (88 [77.9%]), cancer (41 [36.3%]), and cardiovascular events (37 [32.7%]). One hundred four trial extensions (92.0%) were analyzed according to the original trial randomization. The reports provided details of 155 analyses of study outcomes. Seventy-four analyses (47.7%) identified statistically significant benefits in the trial extension phase. In 21 of these (28.4%), benefits were significant only in this period. Null results in both the original and extended trials were seen in 34 of the analyses (21.9%). Loss of significant benefits of an intervention were seen in 12 analyses (7.7%). Statistically significant harms were seen in 16 trial extension analyses (10.3%), and in 14 of these (87.5%), the harms were significant only in the trial extension phase.

Conclusions and Relevance

Trial extension by linkage to routinely collected data is a versatile underused approach that may add critical insights beyond those of the original trial. Some beneficial and harmful outcomes of interventions are captured only in the extension phase of randomized trials.

### Long-term follow-up for melanoma patients: is there any evidence of a benefit? [^bf4af6d9]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

As the incidence of melanoma and the number of melanoma survivors continues to rise, optimal surveillance strategies are needed that balance the risks and benefits of screening in the context of contemporary resource use. Detection of recurrences has important implications for clinical management. Most current surveillance recommendations for melanoma survivors are based on low-level evidence with wide variations in practice patterns and an unknown clinical impact for the melanoma survivor.

### Successes, lessons and opportunities: 15-year follow-up of an integrated evidence-based medicine curriculum [^9a42e851]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Successes

The 2-day EBP workshop and 1 hour of quarterly didactic lectures are the most consistently highly rated components of the programme. The goal is to teach principles pertaining to better understand health information (and how it can be misleading) in an engaging and entertaining manner. The general philosophy is to 'light a fire, not fill the bucket'.he workshop consists of lectures on therapeutic, diagnostic and systematic reviews followed by accompanying small groups where students practice these skills performing evidence appraisal on a representative paper for each. The goal is not for the residents to become experts in evidence appraisal, rather to be familiar with the process and how many ways we can be misled. We have replaced traditional database searching techniques with sessions in which students are taught how to find and use preappraised and high-quality summary resources. In this context, preappraised resources are defined as evidence that has been filtered — such that only the most relevant data are reviewed and has been subjected to a rigorous evidence appraisal process by a third party not involved in the development of the evidence. While we do not provide specific tools to assess preappraised resources, residents are provided with a number of examples of high-quality resources and encouraged to approach newly available resources with scepticism and common sense. In particular, preappraised resources should complete the same process of evidence appraisal that residents have been introduced to, saving residents substantial time. They should be free of financial and other potential conflicts of interest. Quarterly 1 hour of didactic lectures during regularly scheduled Family Medicine academic days allow for a brief review of a number of relevant research articles in the context of EBP principles. Papers are generally picked to highlight well-done randomised controlled trials with patient-oriented outcomes that are potentially practice changing. In addition, papers with significant limitations are highlighted as an example of how research can be misleading. These lectures provide examples of what residents should expect from preappraised resources.
