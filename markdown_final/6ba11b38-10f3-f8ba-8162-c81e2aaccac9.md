## Question

Can you provide an overview of the diagnostic workup for a patient presenting with dizziness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of the diagnostic workup for a patient presenting with dizziness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage to exclude time-sensitive emergencies. Then, I should verify how to classify the dizziness syndrome using timing and triggers. Next, I will examine the targeted bedside examination by syndrome, including HINTS, Dix-Hallpike, and gait assessment. After that, I need to check when imaging is indicated and which modality to choose. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation, and follow-up, while continuously validating claims against guidelines and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the initial triage priorities, because missing a stroke or other time-sensitive emergency is the highest-risk error. I need to ensure I screen immediately for obvious neurologic deficits, hemodynamic instability, or other red flags that would activate stroke protocols or urgent medical management, since about 4–15% of acute dizziness presentations harbor stroke and misdiagnosis is common when relying on symptom quality alone [^7b1afc98] [^ecfe042a] [^7f9000ae].

> Wait, let me verify the next step before jumping to testing. After excluding obvious emergencies, I should screen for general medical causes that can masquerade as dizziness, such as orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmia, anemia, hypoglycemia, or medication effects, because these account for roughly half of acutely dizzy patients and are often revealed by vitals, orthostatics, ECG, or targeted labs rather than neuroimaging [^ecfe042a] [^4f91cf15].

> I will now examine the classification framework, since this drives the entire diagnostic pathway. The modern, evidence-based approach prioritizes timing and triggers over vague symptom descriptors, placing patients into acute vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, or triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, which aligns with international consensus and improves diagnostic clarity and test selection [^470ee741] [^7f9000ae] [^3b005678].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm that routine CT is discouraged in isolated dizziness without red flags, given its very low sensitivity for early ischemic stroke and the risk of false reassurance; pooled sensitivity for noncontrast CT to detect central causes is around 28.5%, whereas MRI misses about 10–20% of posterior circulation strokes in the first 24–72 hours, so a negative scan does not exclude stroke in the acute window [^3f99685c] [^583a7e4a] [^6ef66937].

> Next, I should review the targeted examination for acute vestibular syndrome, where HINTS is central. Let me think about the components and performance: head impulse, nystagmus characteristics, and test of skew, ideally with hearing assessment (HINTS plus), can rapidly distinguish peripheral vestibular neuritis from central stroke when performed by trained clinicians, with neurologist-performed HINTS showing sensitivity around 96.7% and specificity around 94.8%, though emergency physician performance is lower and requires training to be reliable [^9b8a75f1] [^396c84cd] [^13be9e4e].

> I should double-check the role of gait in AVS when nystagmus is absent. Severity of gait unsteadiness helps flag central causes; patients who cannot stand unaided or walk without support raise concern for cerebellar or brainstem involvement and should prompt imaging even if HINTS is not feasible or is equivocal, reinforcing that gait assessment is a mandatory part of the exam in all dizzy patients [^d1026618] [^4f91cf15].

> For triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, I need to ensure I perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver correctly and interpret the nystagmus. Torsional upbeating nystagmus confirms posterior canal BPPV, and if horizontal or direction-changing nystagmus is seen, I should use the supine roll test for lateral canal BPPV; importantly, I should not order imaging for typical BPPV without atypical features, and I should treat immediately with the Epley maneuver, which has high rates of symptom resolution and conversion to negative testing [^7f118857] [^ed459e67] [^e5306638] [^a2c223eb].

> Let me consider spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome carefully, because the differential includes vestibular migraine versus TIA. I should confirm the presence of migraine features, auditory symptoms, and vascular risk factors, and if TIA is suspected, I should avoid CT and instead consider CTA or MRA of the head and neck to evaluate posterior circulation, given CT's poor sensitivity for early ischemia in this context [^55b911fa] [^3fcb6d45].

> I need to check when imaging becomes indicated despite a negative or equivocal bedside evaluation. In AVS, if HINTS is central or equivocal, or if gait is severely unsteady, stroke-protocol MRI with DWI and MRA is recommended to confirm or exclude posterior circulation stroke; in s-EVS with TIA concern, CTA or MRA is appropriate; in t-EVS, imaging is reserved for atypical features or refractory cases, and routine CT should be avoided given low yield and potential harm from false negatives [^f44714c1] [^55b911fa] [^b5b7b4b3] [^3fcb6d45].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has multiple comorbidities. In older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold to image when gait instability, vascular risk, or atypical features are present, and I should remember that BPPV is common and underrecognized in this group, so positional testing remains essential even when symptoms are described vaguely as imbalance rather than vertigo [^fbd374c3] [^7f118857].

> I should confirm documentation and follow-up elements that reduce misdiagnosis and improve safety. Recording the timing and triggers, nystagmus characteristics, HINTS findings, gait assessment, and the rationale for or against imaging creates a reproducible record and supports shared decision-making; reassessment within about a month is advised for BPPV and other vestibular diagnoses to ensure resolution and address persistent symptoms or alternative etiologies [^f10f2058] [^50bbe2aa].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle to ensure internal consistency. The modern approach replaces a symptom-quality framework with a timing-and-triggers paradigm anchored in a targeted bedside neurovestibular examination, reserving imaging for selected cases and prioritizing early, definitive treatments like canalith repositioning for BPPV and stroke pathway activation when central signs emerge, which together reduce misdiagnosis, unnecessary testing, and cost while improving timeliness of care [^470ee741] [^13be9e4e] [^4f91cf15].

---

The diagnostic workup for dizziness centers on a **timing-and-triggers** approach [^470ee741] with a **targeted bedside exam** to distinguish peripheral from central causes [^4f91cf15]. Most patients do not need imaging; reserve **MRI with DWI** for red flags or equivocal exams [^6ef66937] [^3f99685c]. Use **HINTS** in acute vestibular syndrome [^9b8a75f1] and **Dix-Hallpike** for positional vertigo [^ed459e67]; avoid routine CT [^a19baf1d] and vestibular testing unless atypical or uncertain [^384d7d5d] [^5907f865]. This strategy reduces misdiagnosis, unnecessary testing, and cost [^cdab39b1] [^8ab54313].

---

## Initial assessment and history

A focused history is essential to classify dizziness and guide testing [^4f91cf15]. Key elements include:

- **Onset and duration**: sudden vs gradual; seconds, minutes, hours, or days [^af805ba7].
- **Triggers**: positional changes, head movements, trauma, anxiety, or none [^7f118857].
- **Associated symptoms**: nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, focal neurologic deficits, chest pain, palpitations, or syncope [^e97b4b1a].
- **Medical history**: hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, migraine, medications, alcohol use [^notfound].

---

## Physical examination

The physical exam should be **targeted** to distinguish peripheral from central causes:

| **Component** | **Findings suggesting peripheral vertigo** | **Findings suggesting central vertigo** |
|-|-|-|
| Vital signs | Orthostatic hypotension | Hypertension, arrhythmias |
| Head and neck | Otoscopy: cerumen, infection, perforation | Cranial nerve deficits, dysarthria |
| Neurologic exam | Normal except for vestibular findings | - Focal deficits <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Gait instability <br/> - Nystagmus (vertical, bidirectional, or pure torsional) |
| Vestibular tests | - Positive Dix-Hallpike (torsional upbeating nystagmus) [^7f118857] <br/> - Positive head impulse test <br/> - No skew deviation | - Negative head impulse test <br/> - Skew deviation <br/> - Direction-changing nystagmus |
| Gait assessment | Mild unsteadiness | Severe ataxia, inability to walk |

## Diagnostic testing

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory testing is **generally not required** unless suggested by history or exam (e.g. CBC, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid function, toxicology) [^4f91cf15].

---

### Imaging

Imaging is **not routine** and should be guided by clinical suspicion:

- **MRI brain with DWI**: gold standard for suspected stroke or when HINTS is central/equivocal [^f44714c1] [^6ef66937].
- **CT head**: low sensitivity for early ischemia; avoid routine use [^a19baf1d] [^3f99685c].
- **CTA/MRA**: consider for suspected TIA or vertebrobasilar insufficiency [^55b911fa] [^3fcb6d45].

---

### Vestibular function tests

Vestibular testing is **not routine**; consider only if the diagnosis remains uncertain or atypical features are present [^384d7d5d] [^5907f865]. Options include videonystagmography (VNG), rotary chair, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and video head impulse test (vHIT) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical algorithms and guidelines

Several **evidence-based algorithms** guide evaluation:

- **TiTrATE**: Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Exam [^4f91cf15] [^6be7b140].
- **HINTS**: Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew for AVS [^9b8a75f1] [^396c84cd].
- **STANDING**: Structured bedside algorithm for rapid differentiation [^7acaf6fe].

---

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

- **Over-reliance on CT**: low sensitivity for early ischemia; use MRI when indicated [^a19baf1d] [^3f99685c].
- **Misinterpreting nystagmus**: vertical or bidirectional nystagmus suggests central causes [^notfound].
- **Failure to test gait**: severe unsteadiness indicates central pathology [^d1026618].
- **Overuse of vestibular testing**: unnecessary in typical BPPV or vestibular neuritis [^384d7d5d] [^5907f865].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Arrange **follow-up** to confirm resolution or pursue alternative diagnoses if symptoms persist [^f10f2058]. Refer to neurology, otolaryngology, or cardiology for complex, refractory, or atypical cases [^notfound].

---

The diagnostic workup for dizziness relies on a **timing-and-triggers** history and a **targeted bedside exam**, reserving imaging and advanced testing for selected cases. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces unnecessary testing, and lowers costs [^cdab39b1] [^8ab54313].

Dizziness is a common clinical presentation that incurs huge financial costs. It is frequently misdiagnosed due to a wide differential involving both benign (inner ear disease) and serious (stroke) disorders. Traditional frameworks that emphasize symptom quality (dizziness/lightheadedness/vertigo) lack diagnostic utility. This Clinical Progress Note reviews the literature on acute dizziness evaluation in adult patients and presents an evidence-based framework for hospitalists to diagnose the majority of undifferentiated dizzy patients at the bedside. Future research should assess the validity of this approach with hospitalists' ability to accurately diagnose dizzy patients, and its impact on patient care and healthcare outcomes.

There are more than four million US ED visits annually for acute vertigo or dizziness at a yearly ED workup cost of over US$4 billion.The roughly one million who have underlying peripheral vestibular causes are generally over-tested,misdiagnosedand undertreated.Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on brain imaging trying to ‘rule out’ dangerous central vestibular causes such as stroke,yet, despite that, one-third of vestibular strokes are missed initially.Misconceptionsdrive ED clinical practice, resulting in inappropriate use of diagnostic tests.Patients with inner ear conditions, such as vestibular neuritis (or labyrinthitis) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are often imaged and admitted unnecessarilyinstead of being diagnosed at the bedside, treated appropriately and discharged; error rates may exceed 80%.Patients with dangerous brainstem or cerebellar strokes (representing about 5% of all dizziness and vertigo presentations in the ED) may be sent home without critical stroke treatments, sometimes resulting in serious harm.

New bedside diagnostic methods to detect strokehave been developed, that are supported by strong evidence,and could be disseminated,but the logical follow-on policy question is, ‘Would it be worth pursuing a radical shift in care to try to reduce misdiagnosis?’ Decision modelling with economic analysis might help answer this question by comparing several hypothetical diagnostic strategies on patient-centred health outcomes of interest.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dizziness and ataxia: 2023 update [^3b005678]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of a patient with dizziness or vertigo is complicated by a lack of standardized nomenclature, significant overlap in symptom descriptions, and the subjective nature of the patient's symptoms. Although dizziness is an imprecise term often used by patients to describe a feeling of being off-balance, in many cases dizziness can be subcategorized based on symptomatology as vertigo (false sense of motion or spinning), disequilibrium (imbalance with gait instability), presyncope (nearly fainting or blacking out), or lightheadedness (nonspecific). As such, current diagnostic paradigms focus on timing, triggers, and associated symptoms rather than subjective descriptions of dizziness type. Regardless, these factors complicate the selection of appropriate diagnostic imaging in patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo. This document serves to aid providers in this selection by using a framework of definable clinical variants. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

A significant number of individuals are affected by symptoms of dizziness. It is the most common complaint among patients over 75 years of age. A large number of these patients seek counsel from their physicians. It is imperative for the evaluating physician to obtain a thorough history and perform a complete physical exam. The proper diagnostic studies must also be obtained to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. The physician should never assume that the dizziness is the result of normal aging prior to ruling out pathologic conditions.

Diagnostic safety: diagnostic test use and diagnostic error

Eliminating all diagnostic errors is impossible,since diagnosis occurs under uncertainty. Efforts to reduce uncertainty toward zero result in increasing marginal costs with diminishing marginal returns for patient safety. Nevertheless, potential exists to improve diagnostic safety. In the ED dizziness/vertigo case, an estimated 35% of underlying strokes are missed,despite the fact that relatively simple, non-invasive, bedside physical examination tests have been shown repeatedly to identify more than 99% of strokes.

Estimates of diagnostic error-associated adverse events are 0.1% of primary care visitsand 0.4% of hospital admissions,but the diagnostic error rate is likely much higher, since harm does not invariably occur. Ballpark estimates place the overall diagnostic error rate in the range of 10–15%.Rates appear to vary by specialty (eg, 5% in radiology vs 12% in emergency medicine),by disease (eg, 2% of myocardial infarctions vs 9% of strokes),and especially by clinical presentation (eg, 4% of strokes presenting traditional symptoms vs 64% of strokes presenting non-traditional symptoms),with atypical and non-specific presentations (such as dizziness) increasing the risk of misdiagnosis dramatically.

Misdiagnoses, when they relate to test ordering (∼15% of misdiagnoses), generally result from underuse.For example, this appears to be the case for young patients presenting dizziness to the ED whose strokes may be missed, sometimes with devastating consequences.Test overuse, however, can also result in diagnostic error (eg, false positives) or overdiagnosis (ie, correct but unnecessary diagnoses). Overdiagnosis includes conditions deliberately being sought, but too mild to warrant treatment,and unrelated ‘incidentalomas’that may beget further inappropriate testing or treatment.Tests may not be appropriate when the expected probability of disease is too low or too high for the test to resolve diagnostic uncertainty in a way that positively influences clinical decision making.Since overuse often occurs in patients with expected low disease prevalence, the risk of false positives is particularly high. Sometimes blind obedienceto false positive or false negative test results from advanced diagnostic technology can lead to error—this appears to be the case with CT for ‘ruling out’ stroke in acute dizziness.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^157f3d08]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

### Diagnostic accuracy of neuroimaging in emergency department patients with acute vertigo or dizziness: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department [^3f99685c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute vertigo or dizziness represent a diagnostic challenge. Neuroimaging has variable indications and yield. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy of neuroimaging for patients presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness.

Methods

An electronic search was designed following patient-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) question-(P) adult patients with acute vertigo or dizziness presenting to the ED; (I) neuroimaging including computed tomography (CT), CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and ultrasound (US); (C) MRI/clinical criterion standard; and (O) central causes (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, others) versus peripheral causes of symptoms. Articles were assessed in duplicate. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to assess certainty of evidence in pooled estimates.

Results

We included studies that reported diagnostic test accuracy. From 6309 titles, 460 articles were retrieved, and 12 were included: noncontrast CT scan-six studies, 771 patients, pooled sensitivity 28.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.4%-48.5%, moderate certainty) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 93.4%-99.8%, moderate certainty); MRI-five studies, 943 patients, sensitivity 79.8% (95% CI 71.4%-86.2%, high certainty) and specificity 98.8% (95% CI 96.2%-100%, high certainty); CTA-one study, 153 patients, sensitivity 14.3% (95% CI 1.8%-42.8%) and specificity 97.7% (95% CI 93.8%-99.6%), CT had higher sensitivity than CTA (21.4% and 14.3%) for central etiology; MRA-one study, 24 patients, sensitivity 60.0% (95% CI 26.2%-87.8%) and specificity 92.9% (95% CI 66.1%-99.8%); US-three studies, 258 patients, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 53.6%, specificity from 94.9% to 100%.

Conclusions

Noncontrast CT has very low sensitivity and MRI will miss approximately one in five patients with stroke if imaging is obtained early after symptom onset. The evidence does not support neuroimaging as the only tool for ruling out stroke and other central causes in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo presenting to the ED.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^13be9e4e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This third Guideline for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-3) from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is on the topic adult patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department (ED). A multidisciplinary guideline panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding five questions for adult ED patients with acute dizziness of less than 2weeks' duration. The intended population is adults presenting to the ED with acute dizziness or vertigo. The panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on the timing and triggers of the dizziness but recognizes that alternative diagnostic approaches exist, such as the STANDING protocol and nystagmus examination in combination with gait unsteadiness or the presence of vascular risk factors. As an overarching recommendation, (1) emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). To help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with the AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus, (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus, (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus, (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT), (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available, and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In patients with the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome: (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In patients with the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In patients diagnosed with pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. It is clear that as of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, partly due to use in the wrong patients and partly due to issues with its interpretation. Most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS. As such, it is not standard of care, either in the legal sense of that term ("what the average physician would do in similar circumstances") or in the common parlance sense ("the standard action typically used by physicians in routine practice").

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^50bbe2aa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3—decision criteria and additional considerations—Consideration of local resources and economic realities may affect the pattern of follow-up, and although patients should be referred back to their primary care physician, referral to a specialist may be valuable for some patients when providers may not be aware of diagnoses such as vestibular migraine. Shared decision making can only be properly done when the important, patient-relevant information is shared with the patient, and clinicians should understand the lack of utility of CT scans in this setting.

### Imaging of dizziness [^d1f946ce]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^733a7d57]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

### Risk of acute brain lesions in dizzy patients presenting to the emergency room: who needs imaging and who does not? [^eece0b7e]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Patients presenting with dizziness, vertigo or imbalance to the ED should first be screened for a general medical cause as well as BPPV as a common and easily treatable disorder. Next, thorough history taking should include timing and triggers of dizziness symptoms and clinical examination should focus on central oculomotor signs and focal abnormalities indicating CNS involvement. Patients with any of the latter signs should undergo brain imaging, usually an early CT in the ED and a delayed MRI after admission. In the remaining patients, decision-making on the need, modality and timing of imaging studies can by guided by our proposed clinical pathway which integrates the empiric risk for ABLs into established clinical algorithms for dizzy patients. Using this practical approach could prevent many unnecessary brain imaging studies in dizzy patients without a central cause and assure imaging in those who require it.

Definitions of the intended patient population—GRACE-3 centers on adult emergency department patients with vestibular presentations and uses these categories to inform questions and recommendations. The group “focused on the presentations of adult ED patients with dizziness (AVS, s-EVS and t-EVS) as discussed above and depicted in Figures 1 and 4,” and notes that “Using these diagnostic categories is key in creating meaningful diagnostic questions and in drafting the recommendations and the diagnostic test characteristics differ based on these presentations.” The figure caption clarifies scope: “For each vestibular syndrome, only the most important and common benign and central causes are listed,” with definitions “AVS, acute vestibular syndrome; … s-EVS, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome; t-EVS, transient episodic vestibular syndrome.”

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on diagnostic algorithms for differential diagnosis of acute vertigo and dizziness and swift identification of potentially harmful causes.

Recent Findings

About 25% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness have a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, including stroke in 4-15%. Diagnostic work-up relies on the combination of symptom features (triggers, duration, history of vertigo/dizziness, accompanying symptoms) and a comprehensive vestibular, ocular motor, and balance exam. The latter includes head impulse, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, skew deviation, and Romberg's test. Recent standardized diagnostic algorithms (e.g., HINTS, TriAGe+) suggest the combination of several elements to achieve a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiation of central and peripheral vestibular causes. Neuroimaging with MRI must be applied and interpreted with caution, as small strokes are frequently overlooked, especially in the acute setting (false-negative rate of up to 50%).

Summary

Diagnostic differentiation of acute vertigo and dizziness remains a complex task, which can be tackled by a structured clinical assessment focusing on symptom characteristics and constellations of ocular motor and vestibular findings. Specific challenges arise in cases of transient or atypical vestibular syndromes.

Acute dizziness and vertigo are common emergency department presentations (≈4% of annual visits) and sometimes, a life-threatening diagnosis like stroke is missed. Recent literature reviews the challenges in evaluation of these symptoms and offers guidelines for diagnostic approaches. Strong evidence indicates that when well-trained providers perform a high-quality bedside neurovestibular examination, accurate diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders and stroke increases. However, it is less clear who can and should be performing these assessments on a routine basis. This article offers a focused debate for and against routine specialty consultation for patients with acute dizziness or vertigo in the emergency department as well as a potential path forward utilizing new portable technologies to quantify eye movements.

### Diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness [^57dc2ead]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Using an algorithmic approach to acutely dizzy patients, physicians can often confidently make a specific diagnosis that leads to correct treatment and should reduce the misdiagnosis of cerebrovascular events. Emergency clinicians should try to become familiar with an approach that exploits timing and triggers as well as some basic "rules" of nystagmus. The gait should always be tested in all patients who might be discharged. Computed tomographic scans are unreliable to exclude posterior circulation stroke presenting as dizziness, and early MRI (within the first 72 hours) also misses 10% to 20% of these cases.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^4f91cf15]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g., Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management-AAFP (...) [^6be7b140]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination—including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination—are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway.

The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result. Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.
30. The success rate is approximately 70% on the first attempt, and nearly 100% on successive maneuvers. 29 Home treatment with Brandt-Daroff exercises can also be successful. If there is no improvement with repeated repositioning maneuvers, or if atypical or ongoing nystagmus with nausea is present, another cause should be considered.
27.

32 It can cause severe rotatory vertigo with nausea and apparent movement of objects in the visual field, horizontally rotating spontaneous nystagmus to the nonaffected side, or an abnormal gait with a tendency to fall to the affected side. Hearing is not impaired in this condition. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is not useful because patients with vestibular neuritis do not have episodic positionally triggered symptoms.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)—radiographic testing is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging. Recommendation against radiographic imaging based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Reduce unnecessary testing and costs, reduce unnecessary radiation and radiographic contrast exposure (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, affordable quality care). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C based on observational studies for radiographic imaging. Level of confidence in evidence: Medium. Benefits: Facilitate timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses; avoid radiation exposure and adverse reactions to testing. Risks, harms, costs: None. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: The panel placed heavy value in the accuracy of the BPPV diagnosis at the outset in that a diagnosis made by appropriate history and Dix-Hallpike is adequate to proceed with management without further testing. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: Patients who have separate indications for radiographic or vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. Policy level: Recommendation against. Differences of opinion: None. Routine radiographic imaging is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV (Table 6). Radiographic imaging of the CNS should be reserved for patients who present with a clinical history compatible with BPPV but who also demonstrate additional neurologic symptoms atypical for BPPV.

### Utility of head CT in the evaluation of vertigo / dizziness in the emergency department [^aa6c5a05]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute dizziness (including vertigo) is a common reason to visit the emergency room, and imaging with head CT is often performed initially to exclude a central cause. In this study, consecutive patients presenting with dizziness and undergoing head CT were retrospectively reviewed to determine diagnostic yield. Four hundred forty-eight consecutive head CTs in a representative sample of dizzy emergency room (ER) patients, including patients with other neurological symptoms, were reviewed to identify an acute or subacute cause for acute dizziness along with the frequency and modalities used in follow-up imaging. The diagnostic yield for head CT ordered in the ER for acute dizziness is low (2.2 %; 1.6 % for emergent findings), but MRI changes the diagnosis up to 16 % of the time, acutely in 8 % of cases. Consistent with the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria and the literature, this study suggests a low diagnostic yield for CT in the evaluation of acute dizziness but an important role for MRI in appropriately selected cases.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common presentation in general practice.Aetiologies of dizziness include vestibular/peripheral causes, cardiovascular or neurological disease, or psychogenic reasons.There is a lack of consensus in internationally accepted and unified reference standards for the core aetiologies.A focused history is essential, in conjunction with clinical examination findings, in establishing a diagnosis.

Dizziness diagnoses range from benign and self-limiting to severe and potentially life-threatening.The impact of dizziness and vertigo on patients’ quality of life can be profound, affecting their physical and mental health and ability to fulfil employment commitments.Specific diagnosis can facilitate measures to attenuate effects on quality of life. Determining the underlying cause can be difficult and complex but is vital.The most serious consequence of failure to establish the specific aetiology of vertigo and dizziness symptom presentations is the failure to manage a central cause of vertigo, such as vertebrobasilar stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) leading to significant morbidity and mortality.Symptom analysis with recognition of accompanying neurological features and physical examination for positional nystagmus remain key aspects of assessment in differentiating central from peripheral vertigo.

Diagnosis and management of vertigo consumes significant medical resources with repeated primary and secondary care presentations, inconsistent prescribing patterns and unnecessary diagnostic procedures.This is compounded by frequently underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed presentations at a primary care level.Despite the inherent difficulties in diagnosis, it is accepted that common presentations of vestibular disturbances can be adequately diagnosed and managed in general practice without specialist referral.The general practitioner’s (GP) approach to diagnosis and management, and their role as gate-keeper to secondary care, is important in reducing misdiagnosis and ensuring appropriate resource allocation.

There is limited evidence of vertigo and dizziness management in the general practice setting, with the majority of research conducted in emergency departments.It is recognised, though, that there is a need to improve educational approaches to acute vertigo care. A singular area for focus is early-career GPs’ practice, including those in specialist GP training programmes. These are practitioners in the process of establishing practice patterns appropriate to the primary care setting. It is possible these patterns may persist into later practice.

This study aimed to establish the frequency of presentations that included a specific vertigo provisional diagnosis versus a non-specific (symptom) problem formulation in the practice of GP registrars (specialist GP trainees). We also sought to establish associations of specific vertigo provisional diagnoses rather than non-specific problem formulations being made in vertigo/dizziness presentations.

Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) describes sudden onset, severe, continuous dizziness that persists for more than 24 hours. Its wide differential presents a diagnostic challenge. Vestibular neuritis is the most common cause, but stroke, trauma, medication effects, infectious, and inflammatory causes all present similarly. The TiTrATE model (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Exam) is systematic way to evaluate these patients, and the HINTS Plus exam (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew, plus hearing loss) is critical in differentiating central and peripheral causes. The importance of recognizing risk factors for stroke and the role of imaging is also discussed.

A careful history and thorough physical examination are necessary in patients presenting with acute neurologic dysfunction. Patients presenting with headache should be screened for red-flag criteria that suggest a dangerous secondary cause warranting imaging and further diagnostic workup. Dizziness is a vague complaint; focusing on timing, triggers, and examination findings can help reduce diagnostic error. Most patients presenting with back pain do not require emergent imaging, but those with new neurologic deficits or signs/symptoms concerning for acute infection or cord compression warrant MRI. Delay to diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke is a frequent reason for medical malpractice claims.

Phd thesis will be done including these 3 parts. STUDY 1 Effects of implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in an emergency department HYPOTHESIS Implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in the acute diagnostic workup for patients presenting with acute onset dizziness/vertigo at the ED, Hospital of South West Jutland, Denmark, along with the routine triage and acute MRI of the brain can reduce the number of un-/misdiagnosed cases to almost zero at the time of discharge from hospital. HINTS and V-hit can be performed by a nurse at the ED with a high level of accuracy. AIMS To investigate the effects of implementing nurse-performed v-HIT and HINTS in patients presenting with acute onset dizziness/vertigo in the ED. DESIGN A prospective cohort of unselected patients with acute onset dizziness/vertigo is compared to a baseline cohort. Data is used for comparison with study population 1 undergoing intervention 1.

In addition, the baseline population are offered a cross sectional follow up visit at the ENT Department, SVS, in order to fill in DHI, as well as undergoing standard vestibular status with HINTS, v-HIT, VNG and posturography. A subgroup of baseline patients with assumed peripheral AVS at the time of the acute attack is appointed according to patient chart, actual history and vestibular status as baseline in study 2. Study population 1: is enrolled prospectively and represents all consecutive patients admitted with acute onset dizziness/vertigo as the primary complaint to the ED. The population undergoes intervention 1: HINTS and v-HIT performed acutely by a group of trained nurses in the ED. Furthermore, acute MRI and usual triage is performed.

AIM The objective is to investigate the number of patients regaining complete balance after peripheral AVS and to compare a historical group undergoing no balance training with a prospective cohort undergoing systematic balance training immediately after the acute attack. Comparability of the two populations will be examined by demographics. METHODS Vestibular status: DHI, HINTS, v-HIT, VNG, and posturography. Intervention 2: The balance training program consists of a six step gaze stabilizing exercise program and a four step general balance stabilizing exercise program, introduced as soon as the patient is able to stand on their own.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^75cdf4e7]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^af805ba7]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière’s disease—history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while “dizziness” is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### MRI dedicated to the emergency department for diplopia or dizziness: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^8dfacf99]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the costs and organizational benefits of diagnostic workup without and with MRI dedicated to the ED.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational uncontrolled before-after study in one ED of a university hospital in France from July 1, 2018, and January 3, 2020. We included all consecutive patients presenting with dizziness or diplopia. The main outcomes were the clinical decision time of ED physicians and the total costs for each strategy. Outcomes were compared using propensity score with inverse probability weighting in the 2 arms and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.

Results

Among the 199 patients during the "before" period (average age: 60.4 years ± 17.6): 112 men (57%), and 181 during the "after" period (average age, 54.8 years ± 18.5): 107 men (59%), the average costs were €2701 (95% CI 1918; 3704) and €2389 (95% CI: €1627; 3280) per patient, respectively. The average time to clinical decision was 9.8 h (95% CI: 8.9 10.7) in the group "before" and 7.7 h (95% CI: 7.1; 8.4) in the group "after" (ICER: €151 saved for a reduction of 1 h in clinical decision time). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated a 71% chance that the MRI dedicated to ED was dominant (less costly and more effective).

Conclusion

Easy access to MRI in the ED for posterior circulation stroke-like symptoms must be considered a relevant approach to help physicians for an appropriate and rapid diagnostic with reduction of costs.

Trial Registration

NCT03660852 KEY POINTS: • A dedicated MRI in the ED for diplopia or dizziness may be considered an efficient strategy improving diagnostic performance, reducing physicians' decision time, and decreasing hospital costs. • This strategy supports clinical decision-making with early treatment and management of patients with posterior circulation-like symptoms in the ED. • There is 71% chance that the MRI dedicated to ED was dominant (less costly and more effective) compared with a strategy without dedicated MRI.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^d8ecc6a1]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière’s disease (MD)—Statement 2: Assessing for vestibular migraine (VM)—Clinicians should determine if patients meet diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine when assessing for Ménière’s disease, a Recommendation with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Benefits include accuracy of diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary treatments or testing, more appropriate treatment, patient education, and promoting multidisciplinary care, while the risk/cost is extra time for assessment. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with Low confidence, and VM is a common cause of dizziness that can closely mimic MD; appropriate assessment could lead to more appropriate treatment. Supporting text notes VM patients are typically younger and more likely to be female than those with MD; a multidisciplinary panel has established diagnostic criteria for VM with migraine features in at least 50% of the vestibular episodes, and VM may present with short (<15 minutes) or prolonged (>24 hours) vertigo; conversely, MD should be diagnosed when characteristic audiometric hearing loss is identified on audiograms even when migraine features are present.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^583a7e4a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Acute dizziness and vertigo—neuroimaging performance and utilization in the ED—Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used but has poor diagnostic sensitivity for ischemic stroke: in a study of over 5500 ED patients with dizziness, 27% had a CT and 3% had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT sensitivity for early-presenting acute ischemic stroke has been shown to be as low as 10%. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) is more sensitive but still misses strokes: a meta-analysis found it missed 6.8% of ischemic strokes within 72 hours and MRI-DWI–negative strokes were five times more common in posterior circulation events; in AVS, early DWI-MRI within 48 hours misses 10%–22% of strokes and 50% of small-volume posterior fossa strokes. For intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), yield in isolated dizziness is low: in 595 ICH cases, only 13 (2.2%) presented with dizziness and a NIHSS of <2, and a pooled analysis of 126 AVS patients found five (4%) with ICH but only two (1.6%) with isolated dizziness. Reliance on a negative CT is associated with harm: patients discharged after a negative CT were 2.3 times more likely to return with a stroke within 30 days than those without CT.

### Validation of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with acute vertigo and dizziness [^7c6aae50]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Vertigo and dizziness are common complaints in emergency departments and primary care, and pose major diagnostic challenges due to their various underlying etiologies. Most supportive diagnostic algorithms concentrate on either identifying cerebrovascular events (CVEs) or diagnosing specific vestibular disorders or are restricted to specific patient subgroups. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a comprehenisve algorithm for identifying patients with CVE and classifying the most common vestibular disorders.

Methods

The study was conducted within the scope of the "PoiSe" project (Prevention, Online feedback, and Interdisciplinary Therapy of Acute Vestibular Syndromes by e-health). A three-level algorithm was developed according to international guidelines and scientific evidence, addressing both the detection of CVEs and the classification of non-vascular vestibular disorders (unilateral vestibulopathy, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular paroxysmia, Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, functional dizziness). The algorithm was validated in a prospectively collected dataset of 407 patients with acute vertigo and dizziness presenting to the Emergency Department at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.

Results

The algorithm assigned 287 of 407 patients to the correct diagnosis, corresponding to an overall accuracy of 71%. CVEs were identified with high sensitivity of 94%. The six most common vestibular disorders were classified with high specificity, above 95%. Random forest identified presence of a paresis, sensory loss, central ocular motor and vestibular signs (HINTS [head impulse test, nystagmus assessment, and test of skew deviation]), and older age as the most important variables indicating a cerebrovascular event.

Conclusions

The proposed diagnostic algorithm can correctly classify the most common vestibular disorders based on a comprehensive set of key questions and clinical examinations. It is easily applied, not limited to subgroups, and might therefore be transferred to broad clinical settings such as primary healthcare.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^5907f865]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Vestibular testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)—Clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, with recommendation against vestibular testing based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and level of confidence is Medium; benefits include facilitating timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses, avoiding patient discomfort from nausea and vomiting from vestibular testing, and reduced costs from unnecessary testing; risks/harms/costs are noted as none; benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; the policy level is recommendation against; and exceptions are patients who have separate indications for vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. The diagnosis of BPPV is based on the clinical history and physical examination with a positive result on the Dix-Hallpike test, which can be accomplished by a trained clinician without specialized testing equipment, and an appropriate CRP can be implemented immediately. Comprehensive vestibular testing is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV, and this does not imply that the use of video-oculographic technology with or without recording should not be used when available to help in identification and differentiation of types of BPPV. Comprehensive vestibular testing may have a role if the clinical presentation is atypical, if Dix-Hallpike testing is equivocal or shows unusual nystagmus, if the diagnosis is unclear, or if additional symptoms aside from those attributable to BPPV are present. In a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive patients referred for vestibular assessment, a 9% reduction in referrals for specialized testing could be realized if the initial provider obtained a thorough case history and completed a Dix-Hallpike test, and among complex patients referred for subspecialty evaluation of BPPV, atypical or unclear nystagmus findings may approach 13% among patients with diagnoses suspicious for BPPV.

STANDING algorithm for patients with dizziness, vertigo, or instability—structure, validation, and performance: The algorithm directs clinicians to examine for nystagmus and proceed via sequential steps “1: Is nystagmus present? 2: Nystagmus characteristics? 3: If HIT is indicated, what is the result? 4: Patient can stand/walk independently?”, with action nodes including “Perform Head Impulse test,” “Supine head roll test for hc-BPPV,” and “Dix-Hallpike test for pc-BPPV,” and terminal labels “Central cause of symptoms” and “Peripheral cause of symptoms.” The protocol “has been internally and externally validated” and “is a focused physical examination aimed at differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness (and specifically making the diagnosis of pc- and hc-BPPV) in four steps,” with step descriptions specifying nystagmus presence/characteristics, head impulse testing for spontaneous direction-fixed nystagmus, and final assessment of gait unsteadiness. Reported performance shows that the “sensitivity for identifying a central cause of the dizziness (mostly strokes) ranged from 93.4% to 100% and the specificities from 71.8% to 94.3%,” it “does not include the test of skew (part of HINTS) or test of hearing (part of HINTS plus),” and “The average time needed for emergency physicians to perform the STANDING protocol is less than 3 min.”

### Rethinking positional nystagmus: beyond BPPV [^462593bd]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Positional nystagmus is a frequently encountered yet often underappreciated clinical sign that provides critical insights into vestibular and central nervous system function. For the general neurologist, recognising and correctly interpreting positional nystagmus can significantly impact diagnostic accuracy and guide appropriate management of common and complex dizziness presentations. The current diagnostic framework for positional nystagmus disproportionately favours BPPV, underestimates central positional nystagmus (CPN), and over-relies on imaging. We argue for a paradigm shift that acknowledges clinical complexity, defines objective diagnostic thresholds, and strengthens neurological training.

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^69812fc6]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, diagnosis and management of vertigo and dizziness needs to be streamlined for primary care. Practical algorithms should be developed and implemented that take into account time and resource restrictions of PCPs, but give pragmatic instructions how to proceed with dizzy patients and to make correct referral and treatment decisions so that those with manageable disease will receive timely treatment, and those who are in risk for serious illness or benefit from specialist consultation will be forwarded to tertiary care. Close cooperation with specialists and other health professions should be part of the routine. Studies are needed to investigate current practice of care across countries and health systems in a systematic way and to test PCP-based education and training interventions that improve patient-reported outcomes.

Modified from AHRQ Web M&M

Most diagnostic decisions are influenced by factors other than maximising individual patient outcomes or even total societal benefit. In our case study example, CT scans are grossly overused in an effort to ‘rule out’ stroke. Studies showing small area practice variation in use of CT scans for dizziness confirm that factors other than optimal patient care are at play in decisions to order a CT.Diagnostic test use by physicians is driven by a mix of incentives and disincentives (box 3), with mixed results for optimal patient care.Risk aversion may be a particularly important factor contributing to wasteful diagnostic test overuse.In the case of CTs for dizziness, major contributing factors include knowledge gaps regarding best evidence,local standards for test-ordering (peer practices),patient preferences and fear of litigation for missed stroke.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^f98bb9a7]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)—history and symptom profile indicate brief episodes but warrant confirmatory testing. Patients with BPPV most commonly report discrete, episodic periods of vertigo lasting ≤1 minute, and approximately 50% of patients also report subjective imbalance between episodes; a cupulolithiasis variant may result in nystagmus that may persist for >1 minute. In up to one-third of cases with atypical histories of positional vertigo, Dix-Hallpike testing will still reveal positional nystagmus, and history alone is insufficient to render an accurate diagnosis of BPPV.

### Can emergency physicians accurately rule out a central cause of vertigo using the HINTS examination? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^396c84cd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common complaint presented in the emergency department (ED). A subset of these patients will present with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). AVS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of vertigo, nystagmus, head motion intolerance, ataxia, and nausea/vomiting. These symptoms are most often due to benign vestibular neuritis; however, they can be a sign of a dangerous central cause, i.e., vertebrobasilar stroke. The Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew (HINTS) examination has been proposed as a bedside test for frontline clinicians to rule out stroke in those presenting with AVS. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS examination to rule out a central cause of vertigo in an adult population presenting to the ED with AVS. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy when performed by emergency physicians versus neurologists.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, and relevant conference abstracts from 2009 to September 2019 and performed hand searches. No restrictions for language or study type were imposed. Prospective studies with patients presenting with AVS using criterion standard of computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were selected for review. Two independent reviewers extracted data from relevant studies. Studies were combined if low clinical and statistical heterogeneity was present. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5 and SAS 9.3.

Results

A total of five studies with 617 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean (±SD) study length was 5.3 (±3.3) years. Prevalence of vertebrobasilar stroke ranged 9.3% to 44% (mean ± SD = 39.1% ± 17.1%). The most common diagnoses were vertebrobasilar stroke (mean ± SD = 34.8% ± 17.1%), peripheral cause (mean ± SD = 30.9% ± 16%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (mean ± SD = 2.2% ± 0.5%). The HINTS examination, when performed by neurologists, had a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI = 93.1% to 98.5%, I 2 = 0%) and specificity of 94.8% (95% CI = 91% to 97.1%, I 2 = 0%). When performed by a cohort of physicians including both emergency physicians (board certified) and neurologists (fellowship trained in neurootology or vascular neurology) the sensitivity was 83% (95% CI = 63% to 95%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI = 36% to 51%).

Conclusions

The HINTS examination, when used in isolation by emergency physicians, has not been shown to be sufficiently accurate to rule out a stroke in those presenting with AVS.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^f10f2058]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

Isolated dizziness—definition and classification state that vestibular symptoms are “isolated” when only nonlocalizing symptoms that commonly accompany vestibular pathology are present, whereas new focal neurological symptoms make the syndrome “nonisolated,” and new hearing symptoms define an isolated audiovestibular syndrome. Vestibular symptoms may be characterized as “isolated” when the only associated symptoms or signs are nonlocalizing ones that routinely accompany vestibular pathology (especially malaise, nausea or vomiting, nystagmus, and postural instability). The presence of new hearing symptoms in an otherwise isolated vestibular syndrome is called an isolated audiovestibular syndrome.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^fb18fa48]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3 acute dizziness and vertigo—adult emergency department (ED) patients with acute dizziness or vertigo of less than 2 weeks’ duration are the target, and the panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on timing and triggers. As an overarching recommendation, emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and in diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). For AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus; (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus; (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus; (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT); (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available; and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. As of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS, and as such, it is not standard of care.

Patients with acute vestibular disorders are often a diagnostic challenge for neurologists, especially when the evaluation must be conducted remotely. The clinical dilemma remains: Does the patient have a benign peripheral inner ear problem or a worrisome central vestibular disorder, such as a stroke? The use of a focused history and the virtual HINTS (head impulse test, nystagmus evaluation, and test of skew) examination are key steps towards correctly diagnosing and triaging the acute vertiginous patient. When looking for signs of vestibulo-ocular dysfunction, there are important technological and practical considerations for an effective clinical interpretation.

Purpose

Vertigo and dizziness are common complaints at emergency departments (ED), often leading to computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography (CTA) studies, which when used non-selectively, have low clinical utility. The study assesses whether two quality improvement interventions (educational rounds and clinical decision making support tool) can better align CTA ordering rates with clinical practice guidelines in the ED workup of vertigo/dizziness at a large community hospital.

Methods

CTA head and neck imaging rates were collected for patients presenting to the hospital's ED with dizziness/vertigo as the chief complaint during 6-month pre- and post-intervention periods and compared rates using the Chi-Square Test. The interventions were joint ED/Diagnostic Imaging/Stroke Neurology rounds discussing CTA head/neck indications and dissemination of a clinical decision making support tool.

Results

The absolute reduction was 5.79% (N=4,230, p<0.001) in CTA rates for patients presenting with dizziness/vertigo between the pre- and post-intervention periods. For vertigo, the absolute reduction was 12.27% (N=402, p<0.005). For dizziness, the absolute reduction was 5.17% (N=3828, p<0.001). Despite the global decrease in CTA studies, there was no statistically significant decrease in CTA rates for the patients who were diagnosed with cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack in the ED, indicating that the interventions were effective in limiting to the targeted CTA studies.

Conclusions

This project was effective in improving patient safety and system efficiency, while providing a framework for low-burden, effective, practice-modifying quality improvement initiatives.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^6ef66937]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3 acute dizziness—neuroimaging in AVS: In adult ED patients with AVS with or without nystagmus, we recommend against routine use of noncontrast CT or CTA to help distinguish between central (stroke) and peripheral (inner ear, usually vestibular neuritis) diagnoses (strong recommendation, AGAINST). In adult ED patients with AVS with or without nystagmus, in situations where a clinician trained in HINTS is available, we recommend against routine use of MRI or MRA as the first-line diagnostic test (prior to physical examination) to help distinguish between central (stroke) and peripheral (inner ear, usually vestibular neuritis) diagnoses (strong recommendation, AGAINST). In adult ED patients with AVS with nystagmus and central or equivocal HINTS results, we recommend use of stroke protocol MRI-DWI and MRA to further help distinguish between central (stroke) and peripheral (inner ear, usually vestibular neuritis) diagnoses (strong recommendation FOR).

### A practical assessment algorithm for diagnosis of dizziness [^93a0df2e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to test a 3-parameter model for diagnosis of dizziness based on the type and temporal characteristics of the dizziness and on hearing status.

Study Design and Setting

We conducted a prospective blinded study at a tertiary referral neurotology practice. Before examination, patients completed a questionnaire reporting type and timing of dizziness symptoms and hearing status. Clinical diagnoses were compared with questionnaire results.

Results

Fifty-seven patients completed the questionnaire. We were able to correctly classify 21 (60%) of the 35 subjects who had a common otogenic cause of vertigo by the diagnostic algorithm.

Conclusion

A simple classification of dizziness by type, timing, and hearing status can be self-reported by patients using a brief questionnaire. This classification scheme is as good as others of much greater complexity.

Significance

The simple classification scheme reported here is based on history alone and facilitates triage of dizzy patients into diagnostic groups for work-up and management.

### Using the physical examination to diagnose patients with acute dizziness and vertigo [^1557492d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) patients who present with acute dizziness or vertigo can be challenging to diagnose. Roughly half have general medical disorders that are usually apparent from the context, associated symptoms, or initial laboratory tests. The rest include a mix of common inner ear disorders and uncommon neurologic ones, particularly vertebrobasilar strokes or posterior fossa mass lesions. In these latter cases, misdiagnosis can lead to serious adverse consequences for patients.

Objective

Our aim was to assist emergency physicians to use the physical examination effectively to make a specific diagnosis in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo.

Discussion

Recent evidence indicates that the physical examination can help physicians accurately discriminate between benign inner ear conditions and dangerous central ones, enabling correct management of peripheral vestibular disease and avoiding dangerous misdiagnoses of central ones. Patients with the acute vestibular syndrome mostly have vestibular neuritis, but some have stroke. Data suggest that focused eye movement examinations, at least when performed by specialists, are more sensitive for detecting early stroke than brain imaging, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with the triggered episodic vestibular syndrome mostly have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), but some have posterior fossa mass lesions. Specific positional tests to provoke nystagmus can confirm a BPPV diagnosis at the bedside, enabling immediate curative therapy, or indicate the need for imaging.

Conclusions

Emergency physicians can effectively use the physical examination to make a specific diagnosis in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo. They must understand the limitations of brain imaging. This may reduce misdiagnosis of serious central causes of dizziness, including posterior circulation stroke and posterior fossa mass lesions, and improve resource utilization.

Regarding medical management for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, SAEM 2023 guidelines recommend to perform the Epley canalith repositioning maneuver at the time of diagnosis of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in adult patients diagnosed by a positive Dix-Hallpike test.

### Emergency department vestibular rehabilitation therapy for dizziness and vertigo: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^1604f2d6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The patient experience of dizziness represents a heterogeneous list of differential diagnoses, including conditions that are potentially amenable to an intervention delivered in an emergency care environment (eg, Epley maneuver for BPPV, corticosteroids for vestibular neuritis [unilateral peripheral hypofunction]), to nonspecific or chronic conditions (eg, persistent postural perceptual dizziness) that are difficult to diagnose and treat in a limited acute care encounter. To complicate matters further, the term dizziness is frequently used by patients to describe various general states of feeling unwell. Although we attempted to exclude patients with obvious nonvertiginous causes of dizziness, such as fever or severe anemia, and included consideration of orthostatic symptoms in the ED-VeRT algorithm, the general tendency to describe various states of unwell as dizziness likely contributes to the classification of some patients into undifferentiated triggered or spontaneous dizziness categories. Patients with undifferentiated dizziness classifications may still benefit from the general education, safety teaching, and diagnostic reassurance provided by a physical therapist, as a previous study observed how patients evaluated by an ED physical therapist for low back pain described benefits from the increased time and attention provided by an expert.

Ideally, we would compare the effect of ED vestibular therapy vs usual care among specific subgroups of diagnostic classifications (eg, BPPV, unilateral peripheral hypofunction), but because usual care participants did not receive the ED-VeRT standardized diagnostic classification algorithm, we were not able to assemble comparator subgroups. Although one might suggest that physician assessments (as documented in final billing diagnoses or physician notes) could be used to specify dizziness subgroups, ED visit diagnoses tend to be symptom-based (eg, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code R42: dizziness) rather than specific diagnoses (eg, ICD-10 code H81.09 Meniere disease), and physician assessments of dizziness in clinical notes have poor reliability and accuracy.This latter point about physician inconsistency in evaluating the patient symptom of dizziness has led to a preponderance of clinician-oriented educational interventions in the extant dizziness literature, which tends to emphasize simplified assessment tools (eg, HINTS) or clinical decision supports in pursuit of a clinician-oriented outcome, such as a decreased miss rate for stroke. Clinician-oriented interventions tend to target overuse of low-value care in the diagnostic workup for dizziness symptoms (routine CT for triggered episodic vestibular syndrome), which we also observed in this study: 63% of study participants received a CT scan, 28% received magnetic resonance imaging.

Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (pc-BPPV) in adults in the emergency department—Epley canalith repositioning maneuver: In adult ED patients with pc-BPPV diagnosed by a positive Dix-Hallpike test, we recommend the Epley canalith repositioning maneuver be performed at the time of diagnosis (strong recommendation, FOR) [moderate certainty of evidence]. Supporting evidence notes that patients confirmed by bedside examination to have pc-BPPV may benefit from acute treatment with the Epley maneuver; across randomized controlled trials with 7-day outcomes, complete resolution of symptoms favored the intervention (four RCTs, n= 251, OR 5.32, 95% CI 2.95–9.59, low certainty) and conversion to a negative Dix-Hallpike test also favored canalith repositioning maneuvers (three RCTs, n= 195, OR 5.96, 95% CI 3.10–11.47, low certainty), though these studies were not on ED patients.
