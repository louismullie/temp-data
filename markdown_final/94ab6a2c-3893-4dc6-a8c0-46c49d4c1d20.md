## Question

18 year old female with abdomen pain, rlq, no alarm symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate an 18-year-old woman with isolated right lower quadrant abdominal pain and no alarm symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and triage. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that change pretest probabilities. Next, I will examine the physical findings that meaningfully shift likelihoods. After that, I need to check which labs are essential and which are low yield. Then, I will consider risk stratification tools and their limitations. Next, I should review imaging strategy tailored to age and sex, including ultrasound-first versus CT pathways. Finally, I will outline management branches for high, intermediate, and low risk, including observation, antibiotics, and surgical consultation, and I will close with documentation, safety netting, and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the absence of red flags and the need for immediate stabilization. Even without alarm features, I should double-check vitals, mental status, and peritoneal signs because subtle instability or peritonitis changes urgency and imaging choices, and I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on a benign diagnosis in a young woman with RLQ pain [^112bHDkA] [^116SB7yt].

> Wait, let me verify the key historical discriminators before I jump to testing. Onset and migration pattern matter, with migration from periumbilical to RLQ increasing the likelihood of appendicitis, and I should ask about nausea, anorexia, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, and menstrual history including last period and contraception, because pregnancy status and gynecologic pathology can mimic appendicitis and alter imaging strategy [^111wABHK] [^1136Hdzq].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical examination elements that carry the most diagnostic weight. RLQ tenderness is the single most useful sign, and rebound or rigidity further increase likelihood, while I should also look for Rovsing, psoas, and obturator signs, assess gait or cough/hop tenderness, and perform a careful pelvic and bimanual exam when appropriate to evaluate for adnexal pathology or cervical motion tenderness that would pivot me toward gynecologic etiologies [^111wABHK] [^112bHDkA].

> I need to check which labs are truly essential. A pregnancy test is mandatory in all reproductive-age females with RLQ pain, and a CBC with differential helps, as leukocytosis and neutrophilia increase the probability of appendicitis, whereas a normal WBC with normal ANC lowers it. Urinalysis can screen for urinary sources, and I should avoid low-yield tests unless the history directs me otherwise [^1136Hdzq] [^111wABHK].

> Let me consider risk stratification carefully. The Alvarado and Adult Appendicitis Scores can structure pretest probability, but I should confirm their limitations in young women, where specificity is reduced. Importantly, no single sign or symptom rules in or out, so I must integrate history, exam, and labs rather than relying on a score alone [^117WV2Mk] [^116Mzu24] [^111wABHK].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy. In nonpregnant adult women, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the most accurate modality for suspected appendicitis and frequently reveals alternative diagnoses, but I need to balance radiation exposure and consider an ultrasound-first approach when gynecologic pathology is suspected or when CT resources or contrast are limited. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic, I should escalate to CT, and in pregnancy, ultrasound followed by MRI is preferred to avoid ionizing radiation [^113454rA] [^1114v2Y1] [^116G2i4R].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk? If there is RLQ tenderness with migration, fever, leukocytosis, or peritoneal signs, I should obtain urgent imaging, typically CT, and arrange early surgical consultation because delays increase perforation risk. Even with isolated RLQ pain and minimal inflammatory labs, appendicitis can still be present, so I should not falsely reassure myself if the story is compelling [^111NC37S] [^116sM8Km].

> If the patient is intermediate risk, I should confirm that observation with serial exams and repeat labs is reasonable, and I need to ensure timely imaging if there is no improvement. A negative CT substantially lowers the risk of missed appendicitis, and if imaging is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, I should continue observation rather than discharging prematurely [^1165kjfQ].

> For low-risk patients, I should double-check that discharge with strict return precautions is safe. I will provide clear instructions for worsening pain, new fever, vomiting, or syncope, arrange follow-up within 12 to 24 hours, and document the rationale for deferring imaging. I should also remember that a recent negative CT does not absolutely exclude early appendicitis if symptoms evolve, so safety netting is essential [^113gF56W].

> I will now examine the differential and key mimics I must not miss. Ovarian torsion, ruptured or hemorrhagic cyst, ectopic pregnancy, PID, right-sided diverticulitis, epiploic appendagitis, ureteral colic, and mesenteric adenitis all belong on the list, and CT or targeted ultrasound helps distinguish these entities. Importantly, appendicitis is frequently missed in females, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and avoid anchoring bias [^116G2i4R] [^113dq7ai].

> Let me reconsider pain control because I should not withhold analgesia. Opioids, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen are appropriate and do not mask findings or delay necessary intervention, so I should treat pain promptly while continuing diagnostic evaluation [^111NC37S].

> Finally, I need to ensure meticulous documentation of history, exam, risk score, labs, imaging decisions, shared decision-making, and follow-up plan, and I should communicate clearly with the patient about uncertainties, red flags, and when to return. This reduces diagnostic delay and improves safety in a population where appendicitis is commonly missed [^113dq7ai].

In an 18-year-old female with isolated RLQ pain and no alarm symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **appendicitis** [^111yQmJy], but the differential is broad and includes gynecologic and urinary causes [^116G2i4R]. Begin with a **focused history and exam** [^111wABHK], then order a **pregnancy test**, CBC, and urinalysis [^1136Hdzq] [^1111Jzaz]. If appendicitis is suspected, obtain a **CT of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast** [^113454rA]; if gynecologic pathology is suspected, start with a **transvaginal ultrasound** [^1136Hdzq] [^112b81r8]. Most patients can be managed as **outpatients** with clear return precautions unless imaging or labs suggest serious disease [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for isolated RLQ pain in a young female without alarm symptoms includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Appendicitis [^112bHDkA] <br/> - Meckel's diverticulitis <br/> - Crohn's disease <br/> - Colitis <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Irritable bowel syndrome [^notfound] |
| Gynecologic | - Ovarian cyst <br/> - Ovarian torsion [^114dggTr] <br/> - Ectopic pregnancy [^1136Hdzq] <br/> - Pelvic inflammatory disease <br/> - Mittelschmerz <br/> - Endometriosis [^11271LzN] |
| Urinary | - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Nephrolithiasis [^notfound] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Muscle strain <br/> - Hernia [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the pain — onset, duration, location, radiation, quality, severity, and aggravating/relieving factors — and screen for associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, and menstrual irregularities. Obtain a **menstrual and sexual history** (LMP, contraception, pregnancy risk) [^notfound] and review past medical and surgical history, including prior abdominal surgeries, inflammatory bowel disease, and recurrent similar pain.

---

### Physical examination

Assess **vital signs** for fever, tachycardia, or hypotension. Perform an abdominal examination for tenderness, rebound, guarding, rigidity, masses, and bowel sounds, and include a **pelvic examination** to evaluate for adnexal tenderness, masses, or cervical motion tenderness [^1136Hdzq]. Also assess for costovertebral angle tenderness and perform a musculoskeletal exam to identify flank or muscle strain.

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Laboratory tests

- **Pregnancy test**: Essential in all reproductive-age females [^1136Hdzq].
- **CBC**: Evaluate for leukocytosis or anemia [^115VuY6i].
- **Urinalysis**: Assess for urinary infection or hematuria [^1111Jzaz].
- **CRP**: Optional, may help differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory causes [^115tN13Q].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound**: First-line for gynecologic pathology (ovarian cyst, torsion, ectopic pregnancy) [^1136Hdzq] [^112b81r8].
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast**: Gold standard for appendicitis and other GI causes; high sensitivity and specificity [^113454rA] [^115Xve6o].
- **MRI**: Consider if radiation avoidance is desired (e.g. pregnancy, young female) [^1114v2Y1].

---

## Management strategies

### Outpatient management

Outpatient care is appropriate for stable patients with reassuring exams and labs, no alarm symptoms, and no significant comorbidities. Provide clear return precautions and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours. Use **clinical judgment** to decide on imaging; reserve CT for moderate-to-high suspicion of appendicitis or alternative serious pathology [^111VL6RX].

---

### Inpatient management

Inpatient care is indicated for patients with concerning vital signs, significant abdominal tenderness or peritoneal signs, abnormal labs (e.g. leukocytosis, positive pregnancy test), or imaging suggesting serious pathology. Management includes surgical consultation (especially for suspected appendicitis, torsion, or ectopic pregnancy), IV fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics when infection is suspected.

---

## Potential complications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis can lead to **appendiceal perforation** with abscess or peritonitis, **ovarian torsion** with ovarian loss, and **ectopic pregnancy** with hemorrhagic shock. Missed inflammatory bowel disease may progress to strictures or fistulas, and unrecognized infections can progress to sepsis.

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours to reassess symptoms and ensure improvement. Educate the patient on **red flags** — fever, vomiting, worsening pain, syncope, or new vaginal bleeding — and advise immediate return. Provide clear activity restrictions and return-to-normal guidance.

---

In an 18-year-old female with isolated RLQ pain and no alarm symptoms, **appendicitis is common** [^1114v2Y1], but the differential is broad. Use a focused history and exam, targeted labs, and selective imaging to guide safe outpatient management with clear return precautions and close follow-up.

Conclusions

Regardless of age, a missed diagnosis of appendicitis was more likely to occur in female patients, patients with comorbidities, and patients with abdominal pain accompanied by constipation. Population-based estimates of the rates of potentially missed appendicitis reveal opportunities for improvement and identify factors that may alert clinicians and mitigate the risk of missed diagnosis.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

Q.1.2: In pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis could the diagnosis be based only on clinical scores?

AA is the most common surgical emergency in children, but early diagnosis of AA remains challenging due to atypical clinical features and the difficulty of obtaining a reliable history and physical examination. Several clinical scoring systems have been developed, the two most popular for use in children being the Alvarado score and Samuel's Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS).

PAS includes similar clinical findings to the Alvarado score in addition to a sign more relevant in children: right lower quadrant pain with coughing, hopping, or percussion. Several studies comparing the PAS with the Alvarado score have validated its use in pediatric patients. However, in a systematic review by Kulik et al. both scores failed to meet the performance benchmarks of CRP (C-reactive protein). On average, the PAS would over-diagnose AA by 35%, and the Alvarado score would do so by 32%.

If we consider patients of preschool age, AA often presents with atypical features, more rapid progression, and higher incidence of complications. This age group is more likely to have lower PAS and Alvarado score than those of school-aged children. This is the reason why Macco et al. retrospectively analyzed data from 747 children (mean age of 11 years) suspected of AA to evaluate the predictive value of the Alvarado score and PAS compared with the AIR score, which includes fewer symptoms than the Alvarado score and PAS, but adds the CRP value and allows for different severity levels of rebound pain, leukocytosis, CRP, and polymorphonucleocytes. The study showed that the AIR had the highest discriminating power and outperformed the other two scores in predicting AA in children.

The use of PAS seems to be useful to rule out or in AA in pediatric female patients. A retrospective observational study demonstrated that at a cutoff of ≥ 8, the PAS showed a specificity of 89% for adolescent females and 78% for all other patients, although the specificities did not differ at a cutoff of ≥ 7. At both cutoffs, the positive predictive values were poor in both groups. At a cutoff of ≥ 3, the PAS showed similar sensitivities in both groups.

### The unexpected epidural: a case report [^112RTbge]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old caucasian G1P1 otherwise healthy female patient was known for a long history of diffuse right and left colonic diverticular disease, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain due to recurrent diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### A mysterious cause of a surgical abdomen [^1157nYop]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Epiploic appendagitis is a rare cause of acute-onset abdominal pain. The severity of pain at presentation and the infrequency with which it is encountered make it a diagnostic challenge.

Objectives

To present a case report exemplifying a diagnostic challenge posed by acute-onset abdominal pain that eventually led to the diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis.

Case Report

A 50-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of excruciating, sudden-onset lower abdominal pain. All routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits, as were an acute abdominal X-ray series. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a focal fatty infiltration in the left lower quadrant with fat-stranding towards the colon, representing the classical radiological presentation of epiploic appendagitis. The patient was admitted and successfully managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and ibuprofen. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged 3 days after admission.

Conclusions

Due to its benign, self-limited course, it is important to recognize this disease process to avoid unnecessary surgical and medical interventions. Epiploic appendagitis should be suspected in patients presenting with acute onset abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant or right lower quadrant with no associated systemic manifestations. Improvements in imaging technology have enabled confirmation of the diagnosis with non-invasive methods.

### Caecal diverticulitis presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report [^114Sas3r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The preoperative diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis is difficult and one report claims it is only made in 9% of the cases, and most of these patients have had previous appendicectomy. Acute appendicitis is by far the initial preoperative diagnosis on account of similar presentation of low grade fever, right iliac fossa pain and tenderness with guarding. However some studies have suggested certain subtle clinical features that may help in differentiating caecal diverticulitis from acute appendicitis including a relatively longer history of right iliac fossa pain with relative lack of systemic toxicity despite prolonged duration of the symptoms especially with a posteriorly located lesion. Nausea and vomiting are less frequent, abdominal pain typically starts and remains in the right iliac fossa rather than beginning in the central abdomen and shifting to the RIF and RIF tenderness is not usually as marked as in acute appendicitis.

As acute appendicitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis, many patients presenting with RIF pain and tenderness with a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis are usually not subjected to preoperative radiological investigations except where the diagnosis is in doubt especially in female patients or where a mass is palpable and a caecal carcinoma is suspected. Our patient did not have a preoperative radiological investigation because of a strong suspicion of an acute appendicitis. However, abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) and computerised tomography (CT) scan have been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy and may play a role in the preoperative diagnosis. In a review of 934 patients with caecal diverticulitis presenting with indeterminate right lower quadrant abdominal pain, Chou et al reported a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 99.5% with abdominal USS with an overall accuracy of 99.5% in the diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis. The preoperative accuracy of distinguishing acute appendicitis from caecal diverticulitis with CT scan has been shown in various studies with a sensitivity and specificity of 98%. The CT scan findings are similar to those of left sided diverticulitis, including caecal wall thickening, focal pericaecal inflammation with stranding of adjacent fascia, associated diverticulitis, abscess formation, extraluminal air signifying perforation and extraluminal mass effect. These features may however be present with caecal pole tumour especially in the presence of tumour perforation or associated peritumoural inflammatory reaction. Caecal diverticulitis may actually be indistinguishable from carcinoma on the CT scan in about 10% of cases.

### Fat-containing lesions revealed by CT in children with right lower quadrant pain [^112rWC5p]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Suspected appendicitis is the most common indication for emergent abdominal surgery in children. The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis can be challenging, and CT is playing an increasing role in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain. Occasionally, alternative diagnoses to appendicitis can be suggested on CT. The appreciation of a fat-containing lesion in the right lower quadrant will often allow a specific diagnosis. Importantly, many of these lesions are self-limited and treated nonoperatively. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the spectrum of fat-containing lesions that can present as alternative diagnoses to appendicitis on CT scans performed for the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain in children.

### Acute appendicitis: efficient diagnosis and management [^111NC37S]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in adults and children, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in males and 6.7% in females. It is the most common nonobstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Findings from the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies aid in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Right lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and periumbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant are the best signs for ruling in acute appendicitis in adults. Absent or decreased bowel sounds, a positive psoas sign, a positive obturator sign, and a positive Rovsing sign are most reliable for ruling in acute appendicitis in children. The Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score incorporate common clinical and laboratory findings to stratify patients as low, moderate, or high risk and can help in making a timely diagnosis. Recommended first-line imaging consists of point-of-care or formal ultrasonography. Appendectomy via open laparotomy or laparoscopy is the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. However, intravenous antibiotics may be considered first-line therapy in selected patients. Pain control with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen should be a priority and does not result in delayed or unnecessary intervention. Perforation can lead to sepsis and occurs in 17% to 32% of patients with acute appendicitis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before surgical intervention raises the risk. In moderate- to high-risk patients, surgical consultation should be accomplished quickly to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from perforation.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^111n2Yma]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^115Kx1L8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Alvarado score" for acute appendicitis.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. It was developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986. The score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups, but it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado score is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis based on a patient's clinical presentation. It considers eight specific signs and symptoms, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

What this involves is a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- Right lower quadrant tenderness is worth 2 points.
- An elevated temperature (higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius) adds 1 point.
- Rebound tenderness contributes an additional 1 point.
- Migration of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant counts for 1 point.
- Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is also scored as 1 point.
- Nausea or vomiting likewise adds 1 point to the total.
- Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 10,000, provides 2 points.
- A left shift in leukocyte count, a sign of increased immature white blood cells, contributes 1 point.

To calculate the Alvarado score, determine the presence of each symptom or sign. If present, assign the associated points and sum them to get a score between 0 and 10.

The resulting score is then interpreted as follows:

- A score of 7 or above indicates "Probable appendicitis". This suggests a high likelihood of appendicitis, often prompting further medical evaluation, such as imaging or surgical consultation.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 6 denote "Possible appendicitis", indicating that appendicitis could be present. Medical professionals would typically consider additional clinical judgment and possibly further testing.
- A score below 5 implies "Unlikely appendicitis", suggesting that appendicitis is less probable, although it's important that clinicians still consider the broader clinical context.

This scoring system provides a structured approach, aiding healthcare providers in the initial assessment and decision-making process regarding suspected appendicitis.

### Computed tomography utilization for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children decreases with a diagnostic algorithm [^113xa6Xn]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) is a clinical calculator used in the pediatric population to assess the likelihood of appendicitis. It is specifically designed for children and adolescents, typically between the ages of 3 and 18 years. The PAS is used to stratify the risk of appendicitis, helping clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing, observation, or surgical consultation is needed. It includes variables such as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, pain migration, tenderness over the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. The PAS is not applicable to patients outside the pediatric age range or those with pre-existing abdominal conditions that could confound the diagnosis of appendicitis.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) provides a straightforward method to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in children by evaluating specific clinical signs and symptoms. This scoring system is based on user responses to a series of questions related to their symptoms. Each symptom, if present, contributes a specific number of points to the overall score.

The symptoms assessed and their corresponding scores are as follows:

- **Cough, percussion, or hopping tenderness in the right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Tenderness in right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Anorexia**: 1 point
- Fever of 38.0ºC (100.4ºF) or higher: 1 point
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point
- **White blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm³**: 1 point
- **Neutrophilia with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 7,500**: 1 point
- **Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant**: 1 point

To calculate the PAS, each boolean input reflecting the presence of these symptoms is evaluated. The response indicating the presence of a symptom adds its assigned score to the total.

Interpreting the total score offers a clear understanding of the risk level for appendicitis:

- A total score of 3 or less suggests a low risk of appendicitis.
- A score ranging from 4 to 6 indicates an intermediate risk.
- A score of 7 or more signifies a high risk of appendicitis.

This scoring system allows for quick assessment and can aid in clinical decision-making regarding the need for further diagnostic evaluation or intervention.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^111CTuiB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric suspected appendicitis — Kharbanda et al prospective cohort derivation and validation of decision rules: Children aged 3–18 years (total 601 patients) were evaluated, and a logistic regression rule using nausea, history of focal right lower quadrant pain, difficulty walking, rebound tenderness and absolute neutrophil count > 6.75×10³ μL yielded that a score of 5 or less identified 108 patients with 106 without appendicitis, with sensitivity 98.7% (95% CI 95.5%-99.9%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.1% (95% CI 93.5%-99.7%); validation sensitivity was 96.3% (95% CI 87.5%-99%) and NPV 95.6% (95% CI 90.8%-99%). A recursive partitioning rule (absolute neutrophil count > 6.75, nausea/emesis/anorexia, maximal tenderness in right lower quadrant) achieved derivation sensitivity 100% (95% CI 97.7%-100%) and NPV 100% (95% CI 96.0%-100%), with validation sensitivity 98.1% (95% CI 90.1%-99.9%) and NPV 97.5% (95% CI 86.8%-99.9%). Patients identified as low risk by either prediction model should be considered for observation instead of imaging.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### Routine ultrasound and limited computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^1165kjfQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical evaluation alone is not accurate enough to manage patients with suspected appendicitis adequately. A diagnostic pathway using routine US, limited CT, and clinical re-evaluation for patients with acute abdominal pain provided excellent results for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis. The use of ionizing radiation was minimal and diagnostic laparoscopy was unnecessary to achieve these results.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Abdominal pain in the post-menopausal female: is ovarian torsion in the differential? [^113jmJjJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ovarian torsion is often thought of as a disease process of reproductive-aged women; however, it is also seen in the extremes of age. In post-menopausal women, it can be both a challenge to diagnose and associated with increased morbidity.

Case Report

We present a case of a 68-year-old woman with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain 6 h before arrival at the emergency department (ED). She was diagnosed with ovarian torsion, secondary to an ovarian mass, and underwent a full malignancy evaluation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Given the higher risk of malignancy in post-menopausal women, ovarian mass-related torsion is an uncommon but important cause of acute-onset lower abdominal pain. Due to the lower prevalence of ovarian torsion in the post-menopausal group, delayed or missed diagnosis is common and may increase associated morbidity. This morbidity is due to the increased likelihood of malignancy and complications of associated medical and surgical treatment of the mass. This report highlights the increased malignancy risk, difficulty with diagnosing torsion in the post-menopausal age group, and the rationale for different management strategies when compared to premenopausal women.

### Imaging the child with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis: current concepts [^116ayjPm]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common condition presenting with right lower quadrant pain requiring acute surgical intervention in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is often not straightforward and can be challenging. Approximately one-third of children with the condition have atypical clinical findings and are initially managed non-operatively. Complications usually result from perforation and include abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, bowel obstruction and death. Cross-sectional imaging with sonography and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful for the evaluation of suspected acute appendicitis in children. The principal advantages of sonography are its lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and ability to precisely delineate gynecologic disease. The principal advantages of CT are its operator independency with resultant higher diagnostic accuracy, enhanced delineation of disease extent in perforated appendicitis, and improved patient outcomes including decreased negative laparotomy and perforation rates.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^116Mzu24]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) is a clinical calculator used in the evaluation of adult patients who present with suspected acute appendicitis. This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, helping to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories based on a variety of clinical factors such as symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The AAS can help guide clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary imaging or surgery in low-risk patients. It is not applicable to pediatric patients, pregnant women, or individuals with previous appendectomy. It should also not be used in patients with other clear causes of abdominal pain.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) calculator assesses the likelihood of acute appendicitis by evaluating patient symptoms and lab results. Users input data related to seven key indicators which are translated into numerical scores based on established categories. The scoring system assigns weights to patient symptoms and lab values as follows:

- **Right Lower Quadrant Pain**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Pain Relocation**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Right Lower Quadrant Tenderness**:

- Present, male = 3 points
- Present, female aged 16–49 years = 1 point
- Present, female aged > 50 years = 3 points
- Absent = 0 points

- **Guarding**:

- None = 0 points
- Mild = 2 points
- Moderate or severe = 4 points

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- ≥ 7.2 and < 10.9 = 1 point
- ≥ 10.9 and < 14.0 = 2 points
- ≥ 14.0 = 3 points

- **Neutrophils (%)**:
- ≥ 62 and < 75 = 2 points
- ≥ 75 and < 83 = 3 points
- ≥ 83 = 4 points

- **C-Reactive Protein, mg/L (for symptoms > 24 hours)**:
- ≥ 4 and < 11 = 2 points
- ≥ 11 and < 25 = 3 points
- ≥ 25 and < 83 = 5 points
- ≥ 83 = 1 point
(alternative ranges for CRP are scored similarly based on different thresholds)

To compute the AAS score, each input response is translated into its respective point value. These scores are summed to produce a total score ranging between 4 and 23. This total score then helps provide a snapshot of appendicitis risk:

- A score of 10 or lower suggests a low risk of acute appendicitis.
- Scores from 11 to 15 indicate an intermediate risk.
- A score of 16 or higher points to a high risk of acute appendicitis.

These interpretations guide clinicians in assessing the probability of appendicitis, allowing for more informed decision-making in potential cases.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^111ofRkD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

Acute right lower quadrant pain is a nonspecific but common clinical complaint. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute right lower quadrant pain and CT has become the most reliable imaging method in the evaluation of these patients. Although there is controversy regarding the best way to perform CT in this setting, oral and i.v. contrast-enhanced CT remains the most commonly used technique. CT with oral and i.v. contrast material facilitates diagnosis of appendicitis and the numerous other entities that may cause right lower quadrant pain.

Computed tomography (CT) for suspected appendicitis — prospective spiral CT of the lower abdomen/upper pelvis with rectal contrast in patients with uncertainty for appendicitis and aged 18–81 y assessed 120 consecutive patients, with 93 (78%) confirmed appendicitis; CT results were 88 true-positive, 3 false-positive, 24 true-negative, and 5 false-negative, yielding sensitivity: 95% and specificity: 89%, and an alternative diagnosis identified in 14 (52%) patients. CT was repeated with the patient in left lateral decubitus position if the appendix was not visualized on the initial scan, and the prevalence of appendicitis was higher than expected in a typical ED population; the detection of acute appendicitis on CT used pathologic findings at surgery or clinical follow-up (reported but details not specified) as the criterion standard.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Clinical, ultrasonographic, and pathologic characteristics of patients with chronic right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that may benefit from appendectomy [^116DSkkf]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pains of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (RLQA) remain a challenging problem worldwide, especially in areas with limited technical background; chronic appendicitis is still a subject of controversy. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and paraclinical data of patients with chronic pains of RLQA who had an appendectomy performed.

Methods

During a period of 4 years, all patients presenting with a chronic pain of the RLQA were selected for our study and underwent clinical assessment and systematic ultrasonography of the abdomen; these served as a basis of selecting candidates for appendectomy. The intraoperative findings, histology results, and outcome after appendectomy were analyzed.

Results

Three hundred nineteen patients presented with chronic pains of the RLQA of which 213 could be finally analyzed; their mean age was 15.3 years; 192 patients were females. They had pains for 2–8 years. Echography showed a heterogeneous lesion in the RLQA in 87% of the cases. The operative findings displayed adhesions and other signs of chronic inflammation in 182 cases. Pathological analysis frequently revealed fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration indicative of chronic inflammation. Eighty-seven percent of the patients were cured by appendectomy.

Conclusions

There is a chronic process involving the appendix that occurs in the RLQA of patients with chronic pains, typically the adolescent female. Appendectomy usually solves the problem. The criteria for selection of candidates still need to be identified, but in the absence of laparoscopic facilities, we recommend appendectomy when no other cause for the pain has been identified.

### Right lower quadrant pain in a young female: ultrasound diagnosis of rectus abdominis tear [^113sqmdW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right lower quadrant pain in young females presents a frequent diagnostic challenge for emergency physicians, with a broad differential and several important diagnoses. Using an "ultrasound first" imaging strategy can help decrease the use of computed tomography scans, with associated savings in radiation exposure, cost, and other resource use.

Case Report

We report a case of right lower quadrant pain in a young woman. After her initial history and physical examination, appendicitis was the leading differential. A bedside ultrasound was performed, leading to the uncommon diagnosis of rectus abdominis muscle tear. The sonographic findings of a muscle tear include increase in size, loss of linear, homogeneous architecture, and decreased echogenicity. Making this diagnosis at the bedside using ultrasound obviated the need for further imaging, avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, and decreasing emergency department length of stay and overall cost, while leading to a tailored treatment plan. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Rectus abdominis tear is a cause of right lower quadrant pain that may mimic appendicitis and should be considered in patients with this complaint. The ability to make this diagnosis with bedside ultrasound may assist in several important patient-oriented outcomes.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^111WBnQX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

The data were prospectively collected over a period from January 18th 2011 to January 2nd 2012 in a large care facility providing both secondary and tertiary level of surgical care in Finland. During the data collection period 13396 surgical patients visited emergency department. All patients admitted into emergency department for suspected appendicitis or pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant (RLQ) were initially included into the study.

Surgeons with their level of experience varying from first year residents to experienced specialists collected the basic data for the construction of the score during the initial examination at the emergency department.

The collected data included clinical findings (tenderness in RLQ, guarding in RLQ, and body temperature), and symptoms (pain in RLQ, migration of pain, vomiting and anorexia), together with laboratory test results (C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte count, proportion of neutrophils), as well as time passed between the onset of symptoms to clinical evaluation. In addition, the surgeons were requested to estimate the probability of appendicitis on clinical basis only with three-step scale: likely, possible, or improbable. Before this estimation, no diagnostic imaging was performed.

### Hydrosalpinx with adnexal torsion in an adolescent virgin patient – A diagnostic dilemma: case report and review of the literature [^113eFxGP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Hydrosalpinx is one of the predisposing factors of adnexal torsion. However, because the incidence of hydrosalpinx in adolescent virgin patients is very rare, it may cause diagnostic dilemma, leading sometimes to suboptimal treatment. We present the case of an 18-yr-old female, not sexually active, presenting with acute lower right abdominal pain. The working diagnosis was of a simple ovarian cyst, so aspiration was performed. Abdominal symptoms reoccurred and sonography revealed a large hemorrhagic cystic mass adjacent to an edematous right ovary. The patient was referred to immediate laparoscopy due to suspected right adnexal torsion. On laparoscopy, the right adnexa was twisted three times causing an edematous ovary with a hematosalpinx. Detorsion was performed. Five weeks later, transabdominal ultrasound reviled normal bilateral ovaries and the hematosalpinx disappeared. In conclusion, hydrosalpinx, although very rare in adolescence, must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Aspiration in such cases is not the treatment of choice and moreover, it may cause complications.

### Routine versus selective abdominal computed tomography scan in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain: a randomized controlled trial [^117XDi6k]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the role of abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. The authors hypothesized that selective use of abdominal CT would reduce imaging without increasing the rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendicitis.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a community teaching emergency department. Adult patients with acute RLQ abdominal pain with suspected acute appendicitis were included. Patients were randomized to mandatory (all patients) or selective (based on clinical evaluation) abdominal CT imaging. The primary outcome was the negative appendectomy rate.

Results

A total of 152 patients were randomized to selective (n = 80) and mandatory (n = 72) intervention groups. The mean (± SD) age was 34.1 (± 3.5) years, and 48% were female. CT imaging was performed in 54 of 80 patients (68%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 56% to 78%) in the selective group and in 70 of 72 patients (97%; 95% CI = 90% to 100%) in the mandatory group. There was a trend to a decreased rate of negative appendectomy in the mandatory group (1/39 [2.6%]; 95% CI = 0.5% to 13.2%) as compared with the selective group (6/43 [13.9%]; 95% CI = 6.6% to 27.3%), with a difference in prevalence rates of 11.3% (95% CI = -3.5% to 26.3%). There was also a trend to a decreased perforated appendix rate in the mandatory group (4/39 [10.3%]) as compared with the selective group (7/38 [18.4%]), with a difference in prevalence rates of 8.2% (95% CI = -8.0% to 24.4%).

Conclusions

In this small sample of adult patients with RLQ abdominal pain and suspected acute appendicitis, CT imaging was performed less frequently in the selective group and there was a trend with mandatory CT imaging to reduced rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendices.

### A case of hickam's dictum: concurrent appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy [^111t4D45]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Both ectopic pregnancy and appendicitis are surgical emergencies that should be considered in female patients who present with right lower-quadrant pain. Deciding on the appropriate imaging modality in the pregnant patient can be difficult. The challenge of diagnosis is compounded when one considers that both pathologies may be present simultaneously.

Objectives

We present a case demonstrating co-occurrence of ectopic pregnancy and appendicitis and suggest an algorithm for evaluation and management of cases with this presentation.

Case Report

A 25-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of 3 days of abdominal pain and a positive urine pregnancy test. After consultation with Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN) and General Surgery, a nondiagnostic pelvic ultrasound (US), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study consistent with appendiceal inflammation, the patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy. While removing the inflamed appendix, the general surgeon noted the right fallopian tube was enlarged, suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. OB/GYN was consulted again intraoperatively and noted a right ectopic pregnancy. The surgical intervention was completed with a right salpingectomy.

Conclusion

In a pregnant patient with right lower-quadrant pain, the differential diagnosis includes ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, or in rare cases, both.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

### Clinical and imaging mimickers of acute appendicitis in the pediatric population [^116kxxEY]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present the imaging appearance of common mimickers of appendicitis in children with right lower quadrant pain.

Conclusion

The majority of children who undergo imaging for suspected appendicitis will end up having an alternative diagnosis. These mimickers can be gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or pulmonary. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses can aid in the challenging task of imaging right lower quadrant pain in the pediatric population.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight lower quadrant pain-suspected appendicitis [^1114v2Y1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain presenting to emergency departments in the United States, where the incidence continues to increase. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of experts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^114GQDV4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

A previously healthy 55-year-old male patient presented repeatedly to the emergency department with severe episodic periumbilical abdominal pain. After an extensive diagnostic work-up and subsequent clinical deterioration, appendiceal diverticulitis was diagnosed. We identified a correlation of white blood cell counts and possibly faecal calprotectin with the clinical presentation. We suggest that appendiceal diverticulitis should be considered in middle-aged patients with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that correlate with laboratory markers of inflammation.

### Does this child have appendicitis? [^115VuY6i]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation may help identify (1) which children with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should undergo immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy and (2) which children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

Objective

To systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

Data Sources

We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database, as well as physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2521 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they (1) provided primary data on children aged 18 years or younger in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis was considered; (2) presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data; and (3) confirmed or excluded appendicitis by surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twenty-five of 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data from these studies were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

In children with abdominal pain, fever was the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis; a fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.8) and conversely, its absence decreases the chance of appendicitis (LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64). In select groups of children, in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected and evaluation undertaken, rebound tenderness triples the odds of appendicitis (summary LR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.3–3.9), while its absence reduces the likelihood (summary LR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Midabdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (LR range, 1.9–3.1) increases the risk of appendicitis more than right lower quadrant pain itself (summary LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5). A white blood cell count of less than 10,000/microL decreases the likelihood of appendicitis (summary LR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17–0.30), as does an absolute neutrophil count of 6750/microL or lower (LR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). Symptoms and signs are most useful in combination, particularly for identifying children who do not require further evaluation or intervention.

Conclusions

Although the clinical examination does not establish a diagnosis of appendicitis with certainty, it is useful in determining which children with abdominal pain warrant immediate surgical evaluation for consideration of appendectomy and which children may warrant further diagnostic evaluation. More child-specific, age-stratified data are needed to improve the utility of the clinical examination for diagnosing appendicitis in children.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### When fever, leukocytosis, and right lower quadrant pain is not appendicitis [^111Lj6Q3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric cystic lymphangioma (MCL) is an uncommon, benign, slow-growing abdominal tumor that is derived from the lymphatic vessels (World J Gastroenterol. 2012;18:6328–6332, Radiographics. 1994;14:729–737). It is most often diagnosed in the head and neck of affected children. Rarely, a lymphangioma can develop within the small bowel (Pan Afr Med J. 2012;12:7). The clinical presentation of patients with an abdominal MCL can range from asymptomatic to acute abdominal pain (J Korean Surg Soc. 2012;83:102–106). We report a case of small bowel volvulus caused by an MCL in a 3-year-old child who presented to the pediatric emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. The child was thought to have a perforated appendicitis and was taken to the operating room where an MCL was identified and resected. This case illustrates the need to consider MCL when a patient presents to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain.

### A child with appendicitis after appendectomy [^113BXnfx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Stump appendicitis, although rare, is a real entity that is often not considered during the evaluation of children with right lower quadrant pain and a surgical history of appendectomy. The history of appendectomy in a child may delay the diagnosis and management of this entity by misleading the physician into thinking that this patient could never have appendicitis again. However, the diagnosis of appendicitis should be considered in any patient with right lower quadrant pain, even if there is a history of appendectomy. We report a case of stump appendicitis 2 years after laparoscopic appendectomy. A review of the pertinent literature is included.

### Common questions about the evaluation of acute pelvic pain [^1136Hdzq]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain of less than three months' duration. It is a common presentation in primary care. Evaluation can be challenging because of a broad differential diagnosis and because many associated signs and symptoms are nonspecific. The most common diagnoses in reproductive-aged women with acute pelvic pain are idiopathic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute appendicitis, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and endometriosis. Among postmenopausal women, cancer must be considered. Findings from the history and physical examination can point to likely diagnoses, and laboratory testing and imaging can help confirm. Women of reproductive age should take a pregnancy test. In early pregnancy, transvaginal ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels can help identify ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. For nonpregnant women, ultrasonography or computed tomography is indicated, depending on the possible diagnosis (e.g., ultrasonography is preferred when ovarian pathology is suspected). If ultrasonography results are nondiagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in pregnant women when acute appendicitis is suspected. If magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable, computed tomography may be indicated.

### Pain as the only consistent sign of acute appendicitis: lack of inflammatory signs does not exclude the diagnosis [^116sM8Km]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults remains tricky, but radiological examinations are very helpful to determine the diagnosis even when the adult patient presents atypically. This study was designed to quantify the proportion of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis that had isolated right lower quadrant pain without biological inflammatory signs and then to determine which imaging examination led to the determination of the diagnosis.

Methods

In this monocentric study based on retrospectively collected data, we analyzed a series of 326 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis and isolated those who were afebrile and had isolated right lower quadrant pain and normal white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels. We determined whether the systematic ultrasonography examination was informative enough or a complementary intravenous contrast media computed tomography scan was necessary to determine the diagnosis, and whether the final pathological diagnosis fit the preoperative one.

Results

A total of 15.6% of the patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis had isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, i.e., they were afebrile and their white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were normal. In 96.1% of the cases, the ultrasonography examination, sometimes complemented by an intravenous contrasted computed tomography scan if the ultrasonography result was equivocal, fit the histopathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis cannot be excluded when an adult patient presents with isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant even without fever and biological inflammatory signs. In our study, ultrasonography and computed tomography were very helpful when making the final diagnosis.

### Appendicitis in the infant population: a case report and review of a four-month old with appendicitis [^113TP2jt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is uncommon in children < 6 months old, with few observational studies reporting cases of children younger than 5 years old with the diagnosis. The classic periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, followed by the onset of fever and vomiting, is present in approximately 40% of pediatric patients under 12 years of age with appendicitis.

Case Report

A 4-month-old girl presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset of grunting, pallor, fussiness, emesis, and diarrhea. The patient was initially afebrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic with a soft, nondistended, nontender abdomen and active bowel sounds. The patient became febrile, with a maximum temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), and remained tachycardic despite receiving fluids and antipyretics. Laboratory studies were notable for mild dehydration and sterile pyuria. Chest x-ray study was negative for infectious etiologies. Initial abdominal ultrasound found no clear etiology of the patient's symptoms. The patient was admitted to inpatient pediatrics for dehydration, fever, and presumed pyelonephritis. Twenty-four hours later the patient's abdomen became distended and diffusely tender to palpation, with obstipation and increasing episodes of emesis. Abdominal x-ray study demonstrated mild gaseous distension of multiple bowel loops with repeat abdominal ultrasound notable for a focal 8-mm, noncompressible hyperemic structure in the right lower quadrant. The patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Appendicitis is a potentially life-threatening condition. In the infant population it frequently presents without the features typically seen in older children.

A 15-year-old girl was admitted with acute crampy abdominal pain and repeated vomiting over the preceding 2hours; no fever, diarrhoea or abdominal trauma was reported. She had started oestrogen-progestin contraception 3months ago. She had sought medical advice twice in the previous weeks for self-limiting episodes of right hand swelling, without urticaria. On examination, she was unwell and in pain, with severe tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were diminished. Blood tests were unremarkable. Two hours after admission, an abdominal ultrasound scanning showed an impressive wall thickening (> 1cm) of the terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon (figure 1). Abundant free intraperitoneal fluids in the pelvis and in the hepatorenal recess were present.edpract;103/1/22/EDPRACT2016311823F1F1EDPRACT2016311823F1Figure 1Marked caecal wall thickening evidenced at the ultrasound scanning.

### Machine-learning based prediction of appendicitis for patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department [^112GNtZ7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Reader study - expert diagnosis

A reader study was conducted to compare the outcomes of the HIVE and HIVE-LAB models with the clinical performance of ED physicians using the same validation set (n = 68). Each case was presented in its original format, mimicking the electronic health record system, and independently evaluated by three ED physicians with one, five, and ten years of post-qualification experience. Each ED physician scored the likelihood of appendicitis for each case on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being 'highly unlikely' and 100 'very likely'. This scale mirrored the probability output of the models.

Initially, the physicians scored each case based on intake information, vital signs, medical history, and physical examination findings. Subsequently, they adjusted the likelihood score, if necessary, after evaluating the laboratory test results for the same case. This two-step evaluation process ensured that the assessments were comprehensive, reflective of real-world diagnostic practices, allowing for an assessment of the added value of the laboratory test results (See Example Case in Additional File 2).

Alvarado scoring system

The Alvarado scoring system, also known as MANTRELS (Migration, Anorexia, Nausea-vomiting, Tenderness in right lower quadrant, Rebound pain, Elevation of temperature, Leukocytosis, Shift to the left), is a 10-point clinical scoring system developed for risk stratification of acute appendicitis for patients presenting with AAP (see Supplemental Table 3 in Additional File 1). A score of ≤ 4 is considered low risk, while a score of ≥ 7 high risk of appendicitis necessitating specialist consultation and/or further imaging. This scoring system was applied to the validation set (n = 68) to compare performance with the HIVE model, the HIVE-LAB model, and ED physicians.

Background

Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare, but serious condition that affects mostly postpartum women but may also be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, malignancies and pelvic surgical procedures. A high index of suspicion is required in order to diagnose this unusual cause of abdominal pain, which can mimic acute abdomen. A case of a 19-year-old at three days postpartum who suffered right lower quandrant pain and was operated for acute appendicitis, but turned out to suffer from OVT is presented herein, as well as modern diagnostic modalities and treatment options of this puzzling clinical condition. Also, a small review of the literature is attempted.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1166LKz4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

However, other differential possibilities include right-sided diverticulitis and perforated colon carcinoma. This case report of an 18-year-old man with segmental omental infarction highlights a much less frequent, self-limited cause of right-sided abdominal pain, which is increasingly identified on computed tomography scans.

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^1169b6pf]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

Functional abdominal pain and alarm features — In children with functional abdominal pain, diagnostic testing (noninvasive or invasive) for Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection should not be undertaken, and the page cautions that diagnostic testing for the infection should not be undertaken in these children after a positive noninvasive test due to anxiety and unnecessary endoscopy. Alarm signs include persistent right upper or right lower quadrant pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, persistent vomiting, gastrointestinal blood loss, involuntary weight loss, deceleration of linear growth, delayed puberty, unexplained fever, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or PUD. In the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, recent updated recommendations did not identify compelling evidence to support upper endoscopy as part of the diagnostic work up.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Chronic appendicitis diagnosed preoperatively as an ovarian dermoid [^111poNst]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent right lower quadrant pain in young women can be a diagnostic dilemma. Chronic appendicitis is often mistakenly excluded from the differential diagnosis. In the present case, pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in a 19-year-old woman with bilateral lower abdominal pain (greater on the right than the left), fever, and elevated white blood cell count. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until resolution of symptoms. The pain recurred 1 month later, and the patient presented to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile and all laboratory results were normal or negative, aside from an elevated white blood cell count. Computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid. At laparoscopy, however, the right tube and ovary were normal, and chronic appendicitis was confirmed. Although computed tomography is often accurate for delineating the cause of pelvic abnormality, it also may be misleading.

### Left-sided appendicitis: more than meets the eye [^111oJzkJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Classic appendicitis is a common condition easily diagnosed by emergency care providers. However, atypical cases represent a diagnostic challenge and can contribute to increased morbidity from a delay in definitive care. It is important to recognize that atypical presentations have an increased risk for underlying anatomic variants, which may require additional imaging as part of management. We present a case of a 13-year-old previously healthy adolescent boy with acute onset of left-sided abdominal pain who was found to have appendicitis in the setting of underlying malrotation.

### Adolescent abdominal pain due to rare mullerian duct anomaly [^113izR3t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint to the Emergency Department (ED). Often, rare etiologies can be discovered in the work up of this common complaint. Here we present the case of an adolescent female who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) or Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich Syndrome. A 12 year old female with known renal agenesis presented with 5 days of left sided abdominal pain that then developed into right lower quadrant pain. She had regular menses for the last 2 years. Ultrasound (US) showed a fluid collection in the lower uterine segment and a complex cystic structure anterior to the uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the patient to have didelphys uterus with "severe dilatation of the cervix/vaginal canal… extending from the right uterine horn" and left-sided ovarian and Fallopian tube torsion. She was taken to the operating room where she underwent vaginal septum excision and a left salpingo-oopherectomy. OHVIRA includes the triad of obstructed hemivagina, uterine didelphys, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. This occurs due to embryologic arrest of the mullerian and mesonephric ducts at 8 weeks of gestation. Most abnormalities are right sided which leads to right lower abdominal and pelvic pain approximately 4 months post-menarche. Diagnosis of OHVIRA is made utilizing US and CT scans. MRI can also be useful to further delineate specific anatomy. It is important for the emergency physician to be aware of this entity as most patients don't present to care until acute, severe symptoms develop. This makes it more likely for them to seek care in the ED as opposed to the outpatient setting.

### Acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age: keys to suggest a complication of endometriosis [^11271LzN]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis

The estimated incidence of appendiceal endometriosis is less than 1% in patients with deep endometriosis. Besides, in the general population, involvement by endometriosis accounts for less than 1% of appendectomy specimens. Endometriotic lesions preferentially affect the body and the tip of the appendix. Clinical presentation is variable. Endometriosis of the appendix is generally asymptomatic and discovered on pathologic evaluation after appendectomy. When symptomatic, patients can have right lower quadrant pain typical for appendicitis and rarely suggestive of endometriosis, unless cyclical or worsening during menses. Exceptionally, appendiceal endometriosis can be revealed by a complication, such as lower gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation or intestinal obstruction from intussusception.

Acute presentation of appendicular endometriosis cannot be clinically distinguished from acute appendicitis. US or CT may then show three different patterns:
usual imaging findings of acute appendicitis;
imaging findings consistent with an appendicular mucocele with an isolated non-specific dilatation of the appendix;
hypoechoic and/or mildly enhanced soft-tissue mass involving the appendix, which is the most suggestive, albeit often very subtle, feature of the disease.

MRI rarely suggests endometriosis as the cause of acute appendicitis. However, if performed, T2-weighted sequences depict a hypointense retractile mass or nodular thickening of the appendix. Involvement of the appendix can also be contiguous to fibrotic implants of the ovarian fossa (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7
26-year-old female presenting with acute right lower quadrant pain. US and CT (a, b) show an irregular pseudonodular hypoechoic (a) enhanced (b) thickening of the appendix (arrows), with pelvic fat stranding. T2W MRI (c) shows a fibrotic endometriotic implant of the right ovarian fossa, invading the appendix (arrows). Surgery was performed and found hemoperitoneum along with many endometriotic implants of the ileocecal region. Pathological reports found endometrial stroma in the muscular layer of the appendix

Although endometriosis is the most likely diagnosis in patients with a known deeply infiltrating endometriosis and mass within the appendix, carcinoid tumors are the most common neoplasm of the appendix in young patients and should be included in the differential diagnosis.

In clinical practice, when appendiceal endometriosis is isolated without pelvic implants, the diagnosis is not performed by imaging. Conversely, the diagnosis may be evoked when features of deep endometriosis coexist with appendiceal findings on imaging. Yet, evoking endometriotic appendicitis before surgery is of importance, as it may require a multidisciplinary team approach.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AnYmS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our review also found that nearly half of individuals with EOCRC reported abdominal pain, based on evidence from 73 studies, and a 1.3- to 6-fold positive association with EOCRC risk across 4 studies. Given its association with a myriad of gastrointestinal conditions, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends computed tomography for evaluating patients with acute right or left lower quadrant abdominal pain and ultrasonography for right upper quadrant pain, though the guidelines also recommend identifying associated symptoms to better focus a differential diagnosis. It may be inefficient and unrealistic to perform colonoscopy for all adults younger than 45 years with isolated abdominal pain, given the low diagnostic yieldand insufficient capacity across the US to accommodate this group. Nevertheless, the fact that 40% of patients with EOCRC presented with abdominal pain and 27% presented with altered bowel habits reinforces that any new symptom should be comprehensively evaluated by a clinician. Our findings suggest that EOCRC should be part of the initial differential diagnosis, and that a plan for follow-up should be in place, such as a 30- to 60-day follow-up visit to confirm whether the original working diagnosis was correct, the red flag sign or symptom has resolved, or to refer for colonoscopy to exclude EOCRC if these criteria are not met. We postulate that all benign causes of red flag signs or symptoms either can be diagnostically confirmed or should resolve with initial treatment. When an alternative diagnosis is not confirmed or signs or symptoms fail to resolve, a colonoscopy to rule out EOCRC should be pursued. Abdominal pain could serve as a marker to prompt further patient-clinician discussion about additional medical history, which could help determine whether further diagnostic work-up is warranted.

Case presentation

A fit 21-year-old female patient presented with abdominal pain since 2 days, severe in intensity more localised in the right lower abdomen. She mentioned similar nature of pain since 7 months; however, it was mild in nature and never 'concerned' her much. She also complained of nausea. She had regular bowel habits. There was no change to her appetite or weight.

Her medical history was not significant with non-significant family history.

Her menstrual history was normal.

On examination, her blood pressure was 134/88 mm Hg, heart rate was 90/m, and she was fully alert and oriented.

With due consent, she was examined. Her abdomen was tender in the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness. There was no palpable lump. There was no guarding/rigidity. General examination was unremarkable.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^113CiBhs]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis at their index ED encounter were more likely to have a longer duration of abdominal pain, no pain with walking, abdominal pain outside the right lower quadrant, no abdominal guarding, and a complex chronic condition compared with children with a timely diagnosis of appendicitis. Based on PAS or pARC scores, children with delayed diagnoses were less clinically discernible. They were more likely to receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiemetic therapy and less likely to receive opioids or undergo imaging. In 76.8% of patients with a delayed diagnosis, there were possibly or probably opportunities to improve diagnosis. Children with delayed diagnosis had worse outcomes. When the diagnosis was made, hospitalizations were longer, appendectomy was less likely, and appendiceal perforation and multiple abdominal surgical procedures were more likely. Taken together, our findings suggest that delayed diagnosis was more likely in patients with less classic presentations, that such patients were less likely to undergo imaging or receive appendicitis-directed treatments, and that a substantial fraction of delayed diagnoses were preventable despite being less clinically apparent.

Among children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, progression of disease occurred between the index and delay ED encounters. Nearly every classic symptom or sign of appendicitis was more likely to be present during the later visit. The PAS and pARC scores, which measure the likelihood of appendicitis, were higher during the delay encounter than during the index encounter. Abdominal guarding and migration of pain to the right lower quadrant were especially likely to develop after the index encounter: each feature was more than 10 times as likely to be present later. The presence of more classic symptoms during a second ED visit makes the diagnosis more discernible to clinicians. Conversely, the absence of classic appendicitis symptoms puts a patient at risk of a delayed diagnosis.

Nevertheless, in this study, most delayed diagnoses were probably or possibly MOIDs, indicating that there were potential opportunities to prevent delay. The 3 elements of the diagnostic process most associated with a MOID were failures in diagnostic reasoning that indicated that the patient's history should have prompted a deeper evaluation. Most children with delayed diagnosis had neither a WBC count nor an imaging study performed at the index encounter. Children with a characteristic history or physical examination should undergo these tests in an effort to prevent delayed diagnosis. In this study, only 22.0% to 61.3% of children received indicated imaging based on a pARC score above the threshold at which imaging is cost-effective. This finding suggests an opportunity to improve detection.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### Pearls and pitfalls in the emergency department evaluation of abdominal pain [^116SB7yt]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED), comprising approximately 5% of total visits. Although not typically serious, abdominal pain often presents many difficult situations for the clinician. Women of reproductive age and elderly individuals represent some of the most challenging patients to evaluate. Although there are general diagnostic and clinical principles that apply to the evaluation of all patients, these two groups deserve extra attention because of the broad differential diagnosis and potential for serious complications. This article outlines the epidemiology of abdominal pain in patients who present to the ED, and provides guidelines pertinent to the evaluation of all patients. In addition, the article discusses the approach to abdominal pain of pelvic origin in women of reproductive age and abdominal pain in elderly individuals.

A rare cause of acute lower abdominal pain in pubertal girls is described. The diagnosis is often missed at initial presentation and this may result in multiple presentations to the emergency department or general practitioner. The clinical features, diagnosis, management and possible complications of this condition are discussed. The case illustrates the importance of keeping this diagnosis in mind when seeing teenage girls with lower abdominal pain.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1155jpvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical case presentation

An 81-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and a laparotomic appendectomy when she was 12 years old presents to the emergency department with intermittent acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The last defecation was 2 days ago, and the bowel is closed to gas. Current medications only include valsartan 80 mg daily. The body temperature is 37.5 °C, and all vital parameters are normal. The remainder of the examination demonstrates pain and localized peritonism in the lower right quadrant. Laboratory tests are normal except white blood cells at 14,000 per microliter.

Questions include the following: How should this patient be evaluated and treated? What is the working diagnosis? Options include stump appendicitis, right colon diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, right renal colic, right colon cancer, bowel ischemia, or inflammatory bowel disease (Fig. 1).

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain – suspected appendicitis [^113454rA]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnostic imaging of patients presenting with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis may be organized according to age and gender and to the presence or absence of "classic" signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis. Among adult patients presenting with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of ultrasound, with improved performance when CT is performed with intravenous contrast. The use of rectal contrast has been associated with decreased time in the emergency department. Computed tomography has also been shown to reduce cost and negative appendectomy rates. Both CT and ultrasound are also effective in the identification of causes of right lower quadrant pain unrelated to appendicitis. Among pediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression ultrasound can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation. Performing MRI after inconclusive ultrasound in pregnant patients has been associated with sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 86% and 97% to 99%, respectively. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Is it possible to predict the severity of acute appendicitis? Reliability of predictive models based on easily available blood variables [^115XrWMh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

On the other side of the coin, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has completely changed our attitude towards some urgent conditions, teaching us that in some cases refraining from surgery can be the safer option. This has been the case with acute right iliac fossa pain. More recent evidence suggest that most cases of suspected acute appendicitis can have a non-operative management, because they can be due either to mild appendicitis that resolves spontaneously or to some other ailment not deserving a surgical operation, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Some evidence seems to suggest that any non-complicated acute appendicitis can be treated non-operatively unless the presence of a faecalith in the lumen of the appendix prevents its drainage and may increase the risk of mucocele or perforation. Advanced imaging — either CT or MRI — can rule out or confirm the presence of an obstructed appendix, but, as already mentioned, those investigations are not without risks or downsides. Some other evidence confirms that an appendicectomy is indicated only in gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, while non-complicated appendicitis can be treated conservatively, even if one fifth of patients treated non-operatively require an appendicectomy within 30 days from the first diagnosis. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no test that has a clinically significant predictive value for gangrenous appendicitis or that can help us foresee the extent of appendicular inflammation, if any.
