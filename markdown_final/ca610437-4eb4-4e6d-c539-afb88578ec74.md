## Question

Rocephin treatment for gonorrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Rocephin (ceftriaxone) treatment for gonorrhea, including current dosing, rationale, alternatives, special populations, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date guidelines. Then, I should verify the exact dosing by body weight and anatomic site. Next, I will review the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for the dose increase. After that, I need to check alternatives if ceftriaxone cannot be used, including efficacy at extragenital sites. Finally, I should confirm special populations, test-of-cure indications, and resistance surveillance considerations, and reconcile any conflicting labeling or historical guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the guideline hierarchy so I don't anchor on outdated information. The 2021 CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines are the most current U.S. authority, superseding the 2015 STD guidelines and the 2020 update, and they explicitly recommend ceftriaxone monotherapy with weight-based dosing for uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites, with doxycycline added only if chlamydia is not excluded [^113dyACU] [^1176YnZH]. I should also cross-check with WHO 2024 guidance, which recommends ceftriaxone 1 g IM as a single dose for genital infections, reflecting international practice and resistance patterns [^112BuQEX].

> Now, I need to verify the exact dosing. For adults and adolescents with uncomplicated gonorrhea, the CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose if the patient weighs less than 150 kg, and 1 g IM if the patient weighs 150 kg or more; this applies to urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal infections, and the dose should be adjusted to 1 g for those with higher body mass to ensure adequate exposure [^113dyACU] [^112dvmQM]. Wait, let me verify the pharyngeal piece; yes, the same weight-based ceftriaxone dose is recommended for pharyngeal gonorrhea, with no reliable alternatives if ceftriaxone cannot be used, which underscores the importance of getting the dose right in heavier patients [^111ryyRa].

> Hold on, I should review the rationale for increasing from 250 mg to 500 mg, because older labels and historical practice sometimes confuse clinicians. The 2020 CDC update and the 2021 guidelines explain that PK/PD modeling and observed treatment failures, particularly at the pharynx, drove the increase; ceftriaxone needs to maintain free drug concentrations above the organism MIC for roughly 20–24 hours, and 500 mg achieves this more reliably than 250 mg, especially for isolates with slightly elevated MICs and for pharyngeal tissue where PK is more variable [^111FvtAX] [^notfound]. I should double-check that the 250 mg dose is still > 99% effective for urogenital disease in older datasets; yes, but that estimate reflects lower MIC circulating strains and does not capture the PK variability seen in heavier patients or at the pharynx, which is why the dose was raised [^113gSa2P].

> Next, I should review what to do about chlamydia coinfection, because ceftriaxone has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days; in pregnancy, use azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose instead of doxycycline to treat chlamydia, while keeping the same ceftriaxone regimen for gonorrhea [^113dyACU] [^111hyrww]. Let me reconsider whether azithromycin should be paired routinely; the 2021 CDC guidance moved away from routine azithromycin dual therapy for gonorrhea due to rising azithromycin resistance and microbiome concerns, reserving azithromycin for chlamydia coverage when indicated or for specific alternative regimens, not as standard gonorrhea dual therapy [^115vStFW] [^111h55ha].

> I will now examine alternatives when ceftriaxone cannot be used, and I need to be precise about efficacy by site. For patients with a cephalosporin allergy or when ceftriaxone is unavailable, CDC allows gentamicin 240 mg IM plus azithromycin 2 g orally as a single-dose alternative, but it is less effective at extragenital sites and is not recommended for pharyngeal infection; cefixime 800 mg orally as a single dose is another alternative, again with lower and less sustained bactericidal levels and limited pharyngeal efficacy, so test-of-cure is advised if used [^111hyrww] [^111KrFmK]. Wait, I should verify the pharyngeal cure rates; the gentamicin–azithromycin regimen achieved about 80% pharyngeal cure versus 96% with ceftriaxone in the G-ToG trial, confirming inferiority at that site and supporting caution and follow-up testing when extragenital infection is suspected or confirmed [^113rGtjU].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with pregnancy. The same weight-based ceftriaxone regimen applies, and chlamydia should be treated with azithromycin 1 g orally rather than doxycycline; no dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment with ceftriaxone in adults, which simplifies care in pregnancy [^113dyACU] [^116MBhxR]. I should confirm neonatal management too; infants born to mothers with untreated gonorrhea should receive ceftriaxone 20–50 mg/kg IV or IM, not to exceed 250 mg, with cefotaxime as an alternative if calcium-containing infusions preclude ceftriaxone, and neonates should be presumptively treated even if asymptomatic [^112UKdTF] [^111wcGzZ].

> Next, I should review when a test-of-cure is indicated, because routine testing is not required for everyone. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea due to lower and more variable efficacy, and for patients with persistent symptoms or suspected treatment failure; otherwise, routine test-of-cure is not needed after recommended regimens for urogenital or rectal disease, though clinicians should maintain vigilance for reinfection or resistance [^114eaXtD] [^112N5W8t]. But wait, what if symptoms persist 3–5 days after therapy and there was no re-exposure? In that scenario, I should obtain cultures for susceptibility testing and consult infectious diseases, because this pattern raises concern for treatment failure or resistance emergence [^1176YnZH].

> I should confirm resistance surveillance thresholds and what to do if they are exceeded. CDC uses alert MICs to detect early shifts: ceftriaxone MIC ≥ 0.125 μg/mL, cefixime MIC ≥ 0.25 μg/mL, and azithromycin MIC ≥ 2.0 μg/mL; in 2019, only 0.1% of U.S. isolates had decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, whereas azithromycin resistance rose to about 5.1%, reinforcing the move away from routine azithromycin dual therapy for gonorrhea [^115vStFW] [^111h55ha]. Hold on, I should verify that clinicians are asked to report suspected failures; yes, CDC requests culture-based confirmation and reporting within 24 hours to enable partner notification and resistance monitoring [^115vStFW].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation so it's actionable. For uncomplicated gonorrhea in adults and adolescents, give ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once if under 150 kg, and 1 g IM once if 150 kg or more, and add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days if chlamydia has not been excluded; no routine test-of-cure is needed for urogenital or rectal disease, but arrange follow-up if symptoms persist or if pharyngeal infection was treated, and counsel on abstinence from sex until 7 days after treatment and until partners are treated [^113dyACU] [^111hFrvL]. I should double-check that this aligns with the FDA label; the current FDA labeling still lists 250 mg for uncomplicated gonorrhea, which reflects older guidance, so I need to explicitly note that the 500 mg regimen reflects updated CDC recommendations and PK/PD modeling rather than a label change, to avoid confusion [^111TSdNw] [^111FvtAX].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed the key caveats. The 500 mg dose is a response to rising MICs, site-specific PK variability, and stewardship goals; it preserves ceftriaxone as first-line while we monitor for resistance, and it replaces the former 250 mg plus azithromycin dual therapy that is no longer recommended due to azithromycin resistance and microbiome concerns, except when azithromycin is needed for chlamydia coverage or in specific alternative regimens [^115vStFW] [^111h55ha]. If ceftriaxone cannot be used, gentamicin plus azithromycin is reasonable for urogenital disease but should be avoided for pharyngeal infection when possible, and cefixime 800 mg is an oral fallback with lower reliability and a need for test-of-cure if used [^111hyrww] [^111KrFmK].

---

Rocephin (ceftriaxone) is the **first-line therapy** for gonorrhea [^113dyACU], with a single 500 mg IM dose for patients weighing < 150 kg and 1 g IM for those ≥ 150 kg [^111hyrww]. This regimen cures > 99% of uncomplicated urogenital and rectal infections [^113gSa2P] and is effective for pharyngeal disease [^111ryyRa]. If chlamydia is not excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^113dyACU]; azithromycin is no longer co-administered due to rising resistance [^111h55ha]. Test-of-cure is not routinely required [^112dvmQM] but is recommended for pharyngeal infection or if symptoms persist [^114eaXtD]. Alternatives (gentamicin 240 mg IM + azithromycin 2 g PO) are reserved for cephalosporin allergy or unavailability [^111hyrww] [^111KrFmK].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard regimen**: 500 mg IM once for patients weighing < 150 kg [^113dyACU]; 1 g IM once for those ≥ 150 kg [^111hyrww].

- **Administration**: IM injection into a large muscle (gluteus maximus or deltoid); aspirate to avoid IV injection [^111TSdNw].

- **Coinfection**: If chlamydia is not excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^113dyACU]; azithromycin is no longer co-administered due to resistance [^111h55ha].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Ceftriaxone achieves **> 99% cure** for uncomplicated urogenital and rectal gonorrhea [^113gSa2P] and is effective for pharyngeal infection [^notfound]. Pharmacokinetics support sustained bactericidal levels above MIC for ~24–50 hours, enabling single-dose cure [^111FvtAX].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Ceftriaxone is **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include:

- **Injection-site reactions**: Pain, induration, erythema [^116o5bhw].

- **Systemic effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, rash, eosinophilia, transient liver enzyme elevations [^notfound].

- **Serious reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, hemolytic anemia, and C. difficile colitis [^notfound].

---

## Resistance considerations

Ceftriaxone resistance remains uncommon in the U.S. (< 0.1%) [^115vStFW], but surveillance is essential [^117L9y6D]. The 500 mg dose provides a pharmacodynamic buffer against isolates with slightly elevated MICs [^111FvtAX].

---

## Follow-up and test-of-cure

Routine test-of-cure is **not required** for uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea treated with recommended regimens [^114fWEkK]. Test-of-cure is recommended for pharyngeal infection [^114eaXtD] or if symptoms persist or recur [^112N5VU6]. Patients should abstain from sex for 7 days after treatment and until partners are treated [^notfound].

---

## Alternative regimens

If ceftriaxone cannot be used (e.g. severe allergy), **alternatives** include gentamicin 240 mg IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO as a single dose [^111hyrww] [^111KrFmK], or cefixime 800 mg PO once (less reliable, especially for pharyngeal infection) [^111hyrww] [^115a2Uxt].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Use the same weight-based ceftriaxone regimen; treat chlamydia with azithromycin 1 g PO once [^113dyACU].

- **Pediatrics**: 25–50 mg/kg IM/IV once, max 250 mg for ≤ 45 kg; > 45 kg use adult regimen [^1118piEe].

- **Neonates**: 20–50 mg/kg IV/IM once, max 250 mg; avoid in hyperbilirubinemia or premature infants [^112UKdTF] [^111wcGzZ].

---

Rocephin (ceftriaxone) remains the **first-line, single-dose therapy** for gonorrhea, with weight-based dosing and high efficacy; add doxycycline if chlamydia is possible, and reserve alternatives for allergy or unavailability.

Discussion

Continued support of gonorrhea prevention and control efforts remains fundamental, and preventing antibiotic resistance is crucial. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone indicate that a 500 mg dose in an average-weight U.S. adult achieves sufficiently high serum levels for an adequate duration to eradicate infection, even with wide pharmacokinetic variability. The high frequency of pharyngeal gonorrhea with substantial underscreening and the increased understanding of wide individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability has contributed to the recommendation for the increased ceftriaxone dose. These recommendations also include a test-of-cure for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea to ensure eradication or detection of a possible treatment failure.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance affects gonorrhea treatment recommendations and other STIs. CDC recommends ceftriaxone monotherapy for treatment because N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, azithromycin resistance is increasing, and prudent use of antimicrobial agents supports limiting their use. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures will be essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^111TSdNw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Directions for Use

Intramuscular Administration

Reconstitute ceftriaxone sodium powder with the appropriate diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose.

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized. A 350 mg/mL concentration is not recommended for the 250 mg vial since it may not be possible to withdraw the entire contents.

As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel.

Intravenous Administration

Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes, except in neonates where administration over 60 minutes is recommended to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired. Reconstitute vials with an appropriate IV diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 100 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone. Withdraw entire contents and dilute to the desired concentration with the appropriate IV diluent.

### Management of gonorrhea in adolescents and adults in the United States [^115iyar3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure.

### Gonococcal infections among adolescents and adults… [^113VuZuH]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Reflecting concern about emerging gonococcal resistance, CDC's 2010 STD treatment guidelines recommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin plus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for C. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment However, during 2006–2011, the minimum concentrations of cefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the N. gonorrhoeae strains circulating in the United States and other countries increased, demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be waning. µg/mL), a higher dose is likely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs. Effective treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea with ceftriaxone requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 24 hours; although individual variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone, a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours MIC > 0. 03 µg/mL.

Furthermore, it demonstrates limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea; in older clinical studies, cefixime cured 97. 5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections are not recommended because of inferior efficacy and less favorable pharmacodynamics.

Patients with suspected treatment failures should first be retreated routinely with the initial regimen used, with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia infection exists, because reinfections are more likely than actual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher likelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing before retreatment.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^116MBhxR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. For infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), the recommended daily dose is 2 to 4 grams, in order to achieve > 90% target attainment. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, Ceftriaxone Injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

### Update to CDC's sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2010: oral cephalosporins no longer a recommended treatment for gonococcal infections [^111AVDy2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Effective treatment is a cornerstone of U.S. gonorrhea control efforts, but treatment of gonorrhea has been complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop antimicrobial resistance. This report, using data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), describes laboratory evidence of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in the United States during 2006–2011 and updates CDC's current recommendations for treatment of gonorrhea. Based on GISP data, CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a first-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections. If cefixime is used as an alternative agent, then the patient should return in 1 week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection.

### Current and future treatment options for gonorrhoea [^111dbGYQ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

The delivery of effective antimicrobial therapy is essential for public health control of gonorrhoea, in the absence of a suitable vaccine. The antimicrobial agent chosen should have high efficacy and quality, lack toxicity and give > 95% success when given empirically. Guidelines, which are informed by surveillance data, are used to aid clinicians in their choice of appropriate agent. Historically, gonorrhoea treatment has been delivered as a single, directly observed dose but this has resulted in failure of successive antimicrobial agents which have been replaced by a new antimicrobial to which resistance has been rare or non-existing. Following the drift towards decreased susceptibility and treatment failure to the extended spectrum cephalosporins, and the lack of 'new' alternative antimicrobials, the threat of difficult to treat or untreatable gonorrhoea has emerged. The challenge of maintaining gonorrhoea as a treatable infection has resulted in national, regional and global response or action plans. This review discusses different approaches to the future treatment of gonorrhoea including; use of ceftriaxone, the injectable cephalosporin at increased dosage; dual antimicrobial therapy; use of drugs developed for other infections and use of older agents, directed by rapid point of care tests, to susceptible infections. Finally, it is considered whether the time is right to readdress the possibility of developing an effective gonococcal vaccine, given the major advances in our understanding of natural infection, molecular pathogenesis and the revolution in molecular biology techniques.

### CDC grand rounds: the growing threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea [^117KWRP4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What Public Health Agencies and Partners Can Do

Several steps taken now might delay the emergence of cephalosporin-resistant strains, mitigate the public health consequences of expanded resistance, and prevent a return to the era of untreatable gonorrhea. Local and state STD control programs are encouraged to use local surveillance data to prioritize high-prevalence areas and populations for enhanced primary prevention, screening, or partner services. Clinicians can help prevent sequelae and spread of gonorrhea by eliciting sexual histories from their patients, screening sexually active MSM and high-risk sexually active women for gonorrhea at least annually at exposed anatomic sites, and treating appropriately. Clinicians also can counsel sexually active adults, particularly those living in high prevalence areas, to engage in mutually monogamous partnerships with uninfected partners and to consistently and correctly use latex condoms, which can reduce transmission.

Ensuring effective treatment is critical. Based on surveillance trends, CDC recently updated its treatment recommendations: gonorrhea at any anatomic site should be treated with a single 250 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus either 1 g of azithromycin as a single oral dose or 100 mg of doxycycline orally twice daily for 7 days. If this recommended regimen cannot be used, two alternative treatment options exist for urogenital or rectal gonorrhea: 1) if ceftriaxone is not available, clinicians can consider cefixime 400 mg as a single oral dose and either azithromycin 1 g as a single oral dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or 2) if the patient is cephalosporin-allergic, clinicians can consider azithromycin 2 g as a single oral dose. If either of these two alternative regimens is prescribed, the patient should return in 1 week for a test of cure. CDC will continue to update treatment recommendations based on surveillance data and clinical research.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Directions for Use

Intramuscular Administration

Reconstitute ceftriaxone powder with the appropriate diluent (see COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY).

Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose.

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized.

As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel.

Intravenous Administration

Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes, except in neonates where administration over 60 minutes is recommended to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired. Reconstitute vials with an appropriate IV diluent (see COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY).

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 100 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone. Withdraw entire contents and dilute to the desired concentration with the appropriate IV diluent.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111FvtAX]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

GISP data show that the ceftriaxone MIC50 and MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit growth of 50% and 90% of organisms, respectively) were only one doubling dilution higher during 2014–2018, compared with the respective ceftriaxone MIC50 and MIC90 during 1992–1995. Although dual drug therapy with different mechanisms of action (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae, concerns regarding potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy as the recommended treatment regimen.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal third-generation cephalosporin with widely variable pharmacokinetics. Efficacy is best predicted by time that the serum free (i.e. unbound) drug concentration remains higher than the organism's MIC (f T > MIC). Although no human data exist confirming the length of time above the MIC required to eradicate gonorrhea at different anatomic sites, using Monte Carlo modeling, ceftriaxone has been estimated to require concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 20–24 hours for effective urogenital gonorrhea treatment. A 250 mg ceftriaxone dose does not reliably achieve levels higher than an MIC ≥ 0.125 μ g/mL for an extended duration. A murine model was used to estimate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters needed for cure at urogenital sites for both susceptible and resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Investigators evaluated the efficacy of various ceftriaxone doses (0.06–30 mg/kg body weight). The lowest ceftriaxone dose that was 100% effective at eradicating the susceptible organism (MIC = 0.008 μ g/mL) 48 hours after treatment was 5 mg/kg body weight, which corresponded to an f T > MIC of 23.6 hours, consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation. Translating into human doses, a 500-mg dose corresponds to 5 mg/kg body weight (80–100 kg) human, whereas 250 mg only corresponds to 3 mg/kg body weight for an 80 kg person.

### CDC grand rounds: the growing threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea [^1148UDgG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins remained the foundation of gonorrhea treatment in the 2010 CDC STD treatment guidelines. These updated guidelines increased the recommended dosage of ceftriaxone to 250 mg and included broadened recommendations for combination therapy: a cephalosporin, preferably ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular dose, should be administered with a second antimicrobial. Combination therapy treats frequently co-occurring pathogens (e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis) and might hinder the spread of cephalosporin antimicrobial resistance.

Unsuccessful treatment of gonorrhea with oral cephalosporins, such as cefixime, was identified in East Asia, beginning in the early 2000s, and in Europe within the past few years. Ceftriaxone-resistant isolates have been identified in Japan (2009), France (2010), and Spain (2011). GISP now provides growing evidence that cephalosporin resistance might be emerging in the United States. Cefixime minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) recently increased, suggesting that the effectiveness of cefixime might be threatened. The percentage of isolates with elevated cefixime MICs (≥ 0.25 μ g/mL) increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 1.4% in 2011 (Figure 3). The increases were most pronounced in isolates collected from men in the western United States and from MSM, the region and population in which QRNG first emerged. The acquisition of a mosaic penA gene encoding a remodeled penicillin binding protein (PBP2) and overproduction of an efflux pump in N. gonorrhoeae appears responsible, at least in part, for reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111mei5R]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal infections) have increased 63% since 2014 and are a cause of sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility and can facilitate transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effective treatment can prevent complications and transmission, but N. gonorrhoeae's ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance influences treatment recommendations and complicates control. In 2010, CDC recommended a single 250 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum as a strategy for preventing ceftriaxone resistance and treating possible coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Increasing concern for antimicrobial stewardship and the potential impact of dual therapy on commensal organisms and concurrent pathogens, in conjunction with the continued low incidence of ceftriaxone resistance and the increased incidence of azithromycin resistance, has led to reevaluation of this recommendation. This report, which updates previous guidelines, recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, concurrent treatment with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) is recommended. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures is essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### Which cephalosporin for gonorrhoea? [^115CAA79]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

The recommended treatment for gonorrhoea in the United Kingdom has, until recently, included the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, which consequently was used by most genitourinary medicine clinics. In 2002 national surveillance data showed that resistance to ciprofloxacin had risen to a prevalence of 9.8% (9% in 2003), indicating that the target of > 95% efficacy in first line therapy was no longer achievable. The third generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone (intramuscular) or cefixime (oral), are the recommended alternatives, but recent audit data reveal other cephalosporins are currently being used to treat gonorrhoea, notably including cefuroxime (intramuscular or, often, oral). A pharmacodynamic analysis was undertaken to determine whether all these regimens were equally potent. Ceftriaxone, 250 (or 500) mg intramuscularly, or cefixime, 400 mg orally, were calculated to give free drug concentrations above the MIC90 for 22–50 hours post dose whereas the cefuroxime regimens being used were pharmacodynamically borderline, achieving this target for only 6.8–11.2 hours and raising the spectre that continued use may select for stepwise increases in resistance, as occurred with penicillin. We therefore underscore that ceftriaxone or cefixime should be the agents of choice to replace ciprofloxacin, as recommended in the new treatment guidelines, and that cefuroxime is a poor substitute.

Gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, is an important cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The selection of appropriate therapy for gonorrhea (i.e., safe, highly effective, single dose, and affordable) is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobial therapies. This article reviews the key questions and data that informed the 2006 gonorrhea treatment recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Key areas addressed include the criteria used to select effective treatment for gonorrhea, the level of antimicrobial resistance at which changing treatment regimens is recommended, the epidemiology of resistance, and the use of quinolones, cephalosporins, and other classes of antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

### Safety of single-dose oral cefixime, intramuscular ceftriaxone, or intramuscular gentamicin for the treatment of gonorrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116o5bhw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence and types of adverse effects between 3 recommended treatment options for gonorrhea and to compare the incidence of injection site pain between single-dose intramuscular ceftriaxone and gentamicin.

Data Sources

A keyword search of MEDLINE (1966 to September 2020), EMBASE (1947 to September 2020), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2020) was conducted. The electronic search was supplemented with manual screening of references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Comparator studies reporting adverse effect outcomes of treatment with cefixime, ceftriaxone, or gentamicin for gonorrhea in humans were included. Data extracted included study year, authors, aim, setting, population, dosing protocols, and outcome results.

Data Synthesis

A total of 298 articles were identified, of which 6 met inclusion criteria. Two randomized controlled trials compared ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Four randomized controlled trials compared cefixime and ceftriaxone. No differences were noted for the occurrence of at least 1 adverse effect between gentamicin and ceftriaxone (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.56–1.18) or between cefixime and ceftriaxone (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.21–5.93). Injection site pain (ceftriaxone and gentamicin) and other adverse effects (all drugs) were common but occurred at similar rates between groups.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Results of this review show a lack of signal for safety concerns with gentamicin-based regimens for the treatment of gonorrhea. Future research should investigate patient acceptability, especially for intramuscular injections.

Conclusions

The use of single-dose cefixime, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin-based regimens for treatment of gonorrhea appears to be safe and acceptable for use in practice.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^114Gjw4H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with ceftriaxone, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ceftriaxone for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ceftriaxone for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ceftriaxone for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections

Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

Acute Bacterial Otitis Media

Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii*, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis * or Peptostreptococcus species.

Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated)

Caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral and rectal)

Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

### Preparing for an era of untreatable gonorrhea [^112kp9CK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The proportion of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates with reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) has increased rapidly since 2006. Clinicians, researchers, and public health officials need to be prepared for the possibility of an era of untreatable gonorrhea. This review focuses on the evidence for current gonorrhea treatment recommendations, potential future treatment options, and other methods to control gonorrhea.

Recent Findings

In addition to an increase in isolates with decreased susceptibility to ESCs, there have been reported treatment failures to both cefixime and ceftriaxone. In response, some countries have increased the recommended cephalosporin dose, and most now recommend dual therapy with an ESC and azithromycin. The pharynx has been implicated as a site for acquiring resistance through transformation with commensal Neisseria species or induced resistance through subtherapeutic antimicrobial levels. Thus, appropriate screening of the pharynx and treatment with a regimen that eradicates gonorrhea from the pharynx is necessary. At present, several studies are evaluating various novel treatment regimens in preparation for an era of untreatable gonorrhea.

Summary

Screening for asymptomatic infections, maintaining culture capacity to monitor antimicrobial resistance, treating with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and ensuring that all sexual partners are treated are among the best strategies to control gonorrhea in the current clime.

### Management of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: summary of evidence from the development of the 2020 gonorrhea treatment recommendations and the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines [^115foTNr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all first-line recommended therapies, making gonococcal antimicrobial resistance a major public health concern given limited antibiotic options currently and an even smaller antimicrobial development pipeline. Since the release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines, azithromycin, part of the 2015 dual-drug treatment regimen, has had a rapid rise in resistance. The 2020 CDC Gonorrhea Treatment Recommendations and the 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Treatment Guidelines were developed weighing the priorities of treating the individual, protecting the population, and preventing antimicrobial resistance.

Methods

Gonorrhea subject matter experts (SME) generated 8 key questions and conducted a literature review of updated data from 2013 to 2019 on gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance, treatment failures, clinical trials, and other key topics. More than 2200 abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were thoroughly reviewed. SMEs also evaluated N gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP).

Evidence

Although there have been reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures internationally, GISP data suggest that ceftriaxone minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have remained stable in the United States, with < 0.1% exhibiting an "alert value" MIC (> 0.25 mcg/mL). However, GISP documented a rapid rise in the proportion of isolates with an elevated MIC (≥ 2.0 mcg/mL) to azithromycin-nearly 5% in 2018. At the same time, new pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, and there is greater recognition of the need for antimicrobial stewardship.

Summary

The 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines now recommend 500mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly once for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites. If coinfection with chlamydia has not been excluded, cotreatment with doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 7 days should be added. Few alternative therapies exist for persons with cephalosporin allergies; there are no recommended alternative therapies for N gonorrhoeae infection of the throat.

### Adherence to CDC recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea-STD surveillance network, United States, 2016 [^114aPT7M]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

SSuN is a CDC-supported, sentinel surveillance project comprised of 10 selected state and city health departments that conduct investigations to collect supplementary information on a random sample of gonorrhea cases reported from all health care providers/reporting sources in their jurisdictions. These investigations include contacting the diagnosing provider to verify treatment and conducting patient interviews to collect behavioral and demographic information. Case weights were developed to account for local sample fractions and adjust for nonresponse by patient sex and age group, allowing CDC to produce estimates representative of all reported gonorrhea cases in these jurisdictions.

Analyses were restricted to seven of the 10 SSuN jurisdictions (Baltimore, Maryland; California, excluding San Francisco; Florida; Massachusetts; Multnomah County, Oregon; Minnesota; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) with documented treatment information (antimicrobials and dosages) for ≥ 90% of cases with complete investigations. Cases with missing patient treatment information (6.7%) were excluded from further analysis. Based on provider report of treatment provided, patients treated with the recommended dual therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhea (i.e. 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g dose of azithromycin [PO]) were classified as having received the recommended regimen. All other patients were classified as having received other regimens. Weighted estimates of the number and proportion of patients treated with the recommended regimen and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated to identify differences in documented treatment by patient characteristics and diagnosing facility type. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) were defined as any male patient reporting male sex partners in the previous 2–3 months or reporting their sexual orientation as gay or bisexual.

In cases where gonococcal expedited partner therapy (provision of prescriptions or medications for the patient to take to a sex partner without the health care provider first examining the partner) is permissible by state law and the partner is unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, the partner may be treated with a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection in the patient has been excluded. Otherwise, the partner may be treated with a single oral 800 mg cefixime dose plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

In cases of suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, clinicians should obtain relevant clinical specimens for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, consult an infectious disease specialist or STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for the patient's sex partner(s) from the preceding 60 days for those with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose gonococcal isolates demonstrate reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins.

### Widespread use of high-dose ceftriaxone therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhea without reported ceftriaxone treatment failure: results from 5 years of multicenter surveillance data in China [^113Mx2Av]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance to Neisseria gonorrhoeae has emerged for each of the antibiotics recommended as first-line therapies following their introduction into clinical practice. To improve rational and effective clinical antibiotic treatment, we analyzed the prescription patterns of antibiotics and their therapeutic effect in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea in China.

Methods

We obtained data from a follow-up multicenter surveillance program. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between demographic/clinical variables with the levels of sensitivity to ceftriaxone and prescription of high-dose ceftriaxone.

Results

In this study, 1686 patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae were recruited in a surveillance network during 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2017 in 7 hospitals distributed in 5 provinces. The prevalence of isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone was 9.8% (131/1333), fluctuating between 5.6% and 12.1%. Injectable ceftriaxone was chosen as the first-line treatment among 83.1% of patients, and most of them (72.7% [1018/1401]) received > 1000 mg dosage. Patients who were previously infected with gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted infections (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.618 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.11–2.358]; AOR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.41–3.069]) or who already used antibiotics for this infection (AOR, 1.599 [95% CI, 1.041–2.454]) were associated with a higher prescribed ceftriaxone dosage. All of the patients recruited in this study were cured regardless of the isolates' susceptibility to ceftriaxone or the dosage of ceftriaxone they received.

Conclusions

No ceftriaxone treatment failure for uncomplicated gonorrhea was reported in China; however, high-dose ceftriaxone was widely used in China. Its impacts need further study.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^112BkK58]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The pharynx tends to be screened less often than other anatomic sites, and globally, most reported ceftriaxone-based regimen treatment failures have involved treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. Ceftriaxone concentrations tend to be more variable in the pharynx, and treatment of N. gonorrhoeae likely requires longer times above the strain's MIC. Continued uncertainty regarding ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in treating pharyngeal gonorrhea and the higher likelihood of treatment failures at this site strengthen the recommendation for an increase in the ceftriaxone dosage to 500 mg.

Changes in azithromycin susceptibility. Azithromycin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is an increasing concern. Genomic epidemiology data confirm that azithromycin resistance can result from multiple mechanisms. Nationally, the percentage of N. gonorrhoeae isolates with reduced susceptibility (MIC ≥ 2.0 μ g/mL) increased more than sevenfold over 5 years (from 0.6% in 2013 to 4.6% in 2018) (Figure). During 2018, among men who have sex with men, the proportion of GISP isolates with an azithromycin alert value was 8.6%, compared with 2.9% among men who have sex with women only. Studies have associated development of reduced azithromycin susceptibility with azithromycin exposure among patients with N. gonorrhoeae infection.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^116iURSx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Combination therapy, using a highly effective gonococcal therapeutic agent with cotreatment for chlamydia, has been recommended since 1985. In 2007, based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project * (GISP) indicating widely disseminated quinolone-resistant gonococcal strains in the United States, CDC no longer recommended fluoroquinolones for treatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining recommended antimicrobial class. Availability of sensitive C. trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were widespread by 2010, but CDC recommended gonococcal dual therapy with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 250 mg IM or cefixime 400 mg orally) and either azithromycin or doxycycline to reflect concerns regarding emerging gonococcal resistance. By 2011, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefixime necessary to inhibit N. gonorrhoeae growth in vitro were increasing. In 2012, cefixime was no longer a recommended gonococcal regimen, with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination therapy the only recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Since publication of the 2015 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, concerns regarding antimicrobial stewardship have increased, especially the impact of antimicrobial use on the microbiome and data indicating azithromycin resistance (elevated MICs) for gonorrhea and other organisms. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling has also affected the understanding of optimal antimicrobial dosing for N. gonorrhoeae treatment. This update provides the rationale for the change in gonorrhea treatment recommendations to a higher dose (500 mg) of ceftriaxone and removal of azithromycin from the recommended regimen.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^114eaXtD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^117Q6o29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

During 2018, CDC staff members and subject matter experts identified essential questions regarding gonorrhea treatment to update the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases conducted for January 2013–May 2019 using the parameters (gonorrhea[MeSH]) OR (gonococcal[all fields] OR gonorrhea[all fields] OR " Neisseria gonorrhoeae "[all fields]) AND (treatment[MeSH] OR antibiotic[MeSH] OR therapy) generated > 2,200 abstracts. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were reviewed. Abstracts from STD conferences held during 2015–2018 and on the National Institutes of Health clinical trials website were also reviewed.

GISP susceptibility data from January 2013 to May 2019 were reviewed. GISP monitors gonorrhea antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the United States through monthly testing of urethral isolates from 25 symptomatic men in each of 25–30 STD specialty care clinics. Regional laboratories conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution to determine MICs for selected antimicrobials. Although the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has not established N. gonorrhoeae resistance breakpoints for ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin, CLSI categorizes isolates with MICs of ≤ 0.25 μ g/mL as susceptible for ceftriaxone and cefixime, and those with MICs of ≤ 1.00 μ g/mL as susceptible for azithromycin. To identify isolates with elevated MICs, GISP uses the following "alert values" to identify potential emerging resistance: MIC ≥ 0.125 μ g/mL for ceftriaxone, ≥ 0.25 μ g/mL for cefixime, and ≥ 2 μ g/mL for azithromycin.

In 2019, during an in-person meeting of governmental and nongovernmental participants, CDC staff members and subject matter experts reviewed data and presented their individual expert opinions. Each essential question was discussed, and applicable published articles were reviewed for their strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. Individual participants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their input, and discussed findings in the context of the modified rating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. † CDC staff members independently reviewed tables of evidence, § individual comments from the participants and professional organizations, and existing guidelines from other organizations to determine if revisions to the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines were warranted.

Recommendations

For treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone (Box). For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lbs), a single 1 g IM dose of ceftriaxone should be administered. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days is recommended. When ceftriaxone cannot be used for treating urogenital or rectal gonorrhea because of cephalosporin allergy, a single 240 mg IM dose of gentamicin plus a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin is an option. Gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily vomiting within 1 hour of dosing, have been reported among 3%–4% of treated persons. If administration of IM ceftriaxone is not available, a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime is an alternative regimen. However, cefixime does not provide as high, or as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as does ceftriaxone and demonstrates limited treatment efficacy for pharyngeal gonorrhea.

BOX
CDC recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections, 2020

Regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, or rectum:

Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg (300 lb)

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lb), 1 g of IM ceftriaxone should be administered.
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.

Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, or rectum if ceftriaxone is not available:

Gentamicin 240 mg IM as a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose OR

Cefixime 800 mg orally as a single dose. If treating with cefixime, and chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.

Ceftriaxone is one of the last remaining treatments available for gonorrhea and a component of the recommended dual therapy with azithromycin in Canada. As of October 15, 2017, only 5 ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates had been reported worldwide (MIC range 0.5–2 mg/L). The highest ceftriaxone MIC reported in Canada was 0.25 mg/L, representing only 0.45% (49/10,805) of all N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested during 2010‒2016. We describe ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Canada.

### Gonorrhoea [^112Ch7eC]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhoea, which has an estimated global annual incidence of 86.9 million adults. Gonorrhoea can present as urethritis in men, cervicitis or urethritis in women, and in extragenital sites (pharynx, rectum, conjunctiva and, rarely, systemically) in both sexes. Confirmation of diagnosis requires microscopy of Gram-stained samples, bacterial culture or nucleic acid amplification tests. As no gonococcal vaccine is available, prevention relies on promoting safe sexual behaviours and reducing STI-associated stigma, which hinders timely diagnosis and treatment thereby increasing transmission. Single-dose systemic therapy (usually injectable ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin) is the recommended first-line treatment. However, a major public health concern globally is that N. gonorrhoeae is evolving high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which threatens the effectiveness of the available gonorrhoea treatments. Improved global surveillance of the emergence, evolution, fitness, and geographical and temporal spread of AMR in N. gonorrhoeae, and improved understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for current and future antimicrobials in the treatment of urogenital and extragenital gonorrhoea, are essential to inform treatment guidelines. Key priorities for gonorrhoea control include strengthening prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of patients and their partners; decreasing stigma; expanding surveillance of AMR and treatment failures; and promoting responsible antimicrobial use and stewardship. To achieve these goals, the development of rapid and affordable point-of-care diagnostic tests that can simultaneously detect AMR, novel therapeutic antimicrobials and gonococcal vaccine(s) in particular is crucial.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115vStFW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone and azithromycin recommended in previous guidance might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae; however, concerns regarding potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy. Consequently, only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating gonorrhea in the United States. Clinicians remaining vigilant for treatment failures is paramount, and CDC plans to continue to monitor for changing ceftriaxone MICs until additional antimicrobials or a vaccine is available. In cases in which chlamydial infection has not been excluded, patients should also receive antichlamydial therapy. CDC and state health departments participate in CDC-supported gonorrhea surveillance activities and can provide the most current information regarding gonococcal susceptibility.

Criteria for resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone have not been defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, isolates with cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs ≥ 0.5 µ g/mL are considered to have decreased susceptibility. In the United States, the proportion of isolates in GISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime has remained low; during 2019, < 0.1% of isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC ≥ 0.5 µ g/mL) to ceftriaxone or cefixime were identified. Because increasing MICs might predict resistance emergence, GISP established lower cephalosporin MIC threshold values that are lower than the susceptibility breakpoints set by CLSI to provide greater sensitivity in detecting decreasing gonococcal susceptibility for surveillance purposes. The percentage of isolates with cefixime MICs ≥ 0.25 µ g/mL increased from 0.1% during 2006 to 1.4% during 2011 and declined to 0.3% during 2019. The percentage of isolates with ceftriaxone MICs ≥ 0.125 µ g/mL increased from < 0.1% in 2006 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.1% in 2019. Isolates with high-level cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs (MICs = 1.5–8.0 µ g/mL and MICs = 1.5–4.0 µ g/mL, respectively) have been identified in Japan, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Decreased susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials is expected to continue; state and local surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is crucial for guiding local therapy recommendations. Although approximately 3% of all U.S. men who have gonococcal infections are sampled through GISP, surveillance by clinicians also is crucial. Clinicians who diagnose N. gonorrhoeae infection in a person with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure should perform culture and AST of relevant clinical specimens, consult an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Isolates should be saved and sent to CDC through local and state public health laboratory mechanisms. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for sexual partners of persons with N. gonorrhoeae infection thought to be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility to cephalosporin. Agar dilution is the reference standard and preferred method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with N. gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic gradient strips, such as Etest (bioMérieux), can be used and are considered an acceptable alternative for quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing with N. gonorrhoeae when manufacturer instructions are followed. Disc diffusion only provides qualitative susceptibility results.

Gonorrhea — alternatives and agents not recommended include that IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100% of cases (lower one-sided 95% CI bound: 98.5%) and "can be considered an alternative to ceftriaxone for persons with cephalosporin allergy", though gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily vomiting < 1 hour after dosing, occurred among 3%–4%. A trial of gemifloxacin 240 mg plus azithromycin 1 g achieved 90% (95% CI: 72%–88%) cure of pharyngeal and 90% (95% CI: 84%–95%) of rectal infections but "is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial stewardship concerns". An 800-mg oral dose of cefixime "should be considered only as an alternative cephalosporin regimen", with limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3% cure; 95% CI: 74.9%–99.1%); older clinical studies reported cefixime cured 97.5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal infections (95% CI: 95.4%–99.8%). Other oral cephalosporins "are not recommended", and although azithromycin 2 g monotherapy was 99.2% effective (95% CI: 97.3%–99.9%), monotherapy "is not recommended". Strains circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible to penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides, so "use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended". Spectinomycin is effective (98.2%) for urogenital and anorectal infection but has poor pharyngeal efficacy; it is unavailable in the United States, and the gentamicin alternative regimen has replaced its need if a cephalosporin allergy exists.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum

Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum Among Adults and Adolescents
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered.

Although clinical data confirm that a single injection of ceftriaxone 250 mg is > 99% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.6%–99.7%) effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea of circulating isolates (MIC = 0.03 µ g/mL), a higher dose is likely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs. Effective treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea with ceftriaxone requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 24 hours; although individual variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone, a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours MIC > 0.03 µ g/mL. The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone might be different in the pharynx with longer times higher than the strain MIC likely needed to prevent selection of mutant strains in the pharynx.

Single-dose injectable cephalosporin regimens, other than ceftriaxone, that are safe and have been effective against uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections in the past include ceftizoxime (500 mg IM), cefoxitin (2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally), and cefotaxime (500 mg IM). None of these injectable cephalosporins offer any advantage over ceftriaxone 250 mg for urogenital infection, and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain. Because the ceftriaxone dose has been increased and the pharmacokinetics of other cephalosporins have not been evaluated, these dosing regimens might be at a disadvantage over ceftriaxone 500 mg.

Alternative Regimens if Ceftriaxone Is Not Available
Gentamicin 240 mg IM in a single dose
plus
Azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose
or
Cefixime* 800 mg orally in a single dose

### Gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-ToG): a randomised non-inferiority trial [^1128ZZ1v]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The causative organism, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, readily develops resistance to antibiotics. High-level resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, and quinolones has led to these no longer being recommended as treatment. Current guidance is to treat with intramuscular ceftriaxone, either as monotherapy or as dual therapy combined with azithromycin. Surveillance data in the UK show a reduction in susceptibility to ceftriaxone over time, with an upward drift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). A similar reduction in susceptibility to other antimicrobials used for gonorrhoea was followed by widespread treatment failure, and sporadic clinical failure of cephalosporins has been reported. If ceftriaxone becomes ineffective, options for treatment are limited. With the exception of gentamicin, alternative drugs have either not been assessed in patients (eg, ertapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam), are still in development before licensing (eg, zoliflodacin, gepotidicin), are reserved for other infections (eg, rifampicin for tuberculosis), or have the potential for resistance to develop rapidly (eg, azithromycin, spectinomycin). Untreatable, multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea is a real possibility, and new clinical trial data are needed to inform treatment guidelines.WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have called for urgent research into the efficacy of new regimens to treat gonorrhoea, including combination regimens and the assessment of antimicrobial efficacy at extra-genital sites. Effective, safe, and low-cost treatment in low-income and middle-income countries is particularly needed; many of these countries have a high burden of gonorrhoea infection.

Summary

Background

Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection for which ceftriaxone is the current first-line treatment, but antimicrobial resistance is emerging. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of gentamicin as an alternative to ceftriaxone (both combined with azithromycin) for treatment of gonorrhoea.

Methods

G-ToG was a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment with gentamicin to treatment with ceftriaxone for patients with gonorrhoea. The patients, treating physician, and assessing physician were masked to treatment but the treating nurse was not. The trial took place at 14 sexual health clinics in England. Adults aged 16–70 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of uncomplicated genital, pharyngeal, or rectal gonorrhoea. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular dose of either gentamicin 240 mg (gentamicin group) or ceftriaxone 500 mg (ceftriaxone group). All participants also received a single 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by clinic and performed using a secure web-based system. The primary outcome was clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at all initially infected sites, defined as a negative nucleic acid amplification test 2 weeks post treatment. Primary outcome analyses included only participants who had follow-up data, irrespective of the baseline visit N gonorrhoeae test result. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was a lower confidence limit of 5% for the risk difference. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN51783227.

Findings

Of 1762 patients assessed, we enrolled 720 participants between Oct 7, 2014, and Nov 14, 2016, and randomly assigned 358 to gentamicin and 362 to ceftriaxone. Primary outcome data were available for 306 (85%) of 362 participants allocated to ceftriaxone and 292 (82%) of 358 participants allocated to gentamicin. At 2 weeks after treatment, infection had cleared for 299 (98%) of 306 participants in the ceftriaxone group compared with 267 (91%) of 292 participants in the gentamicin group (adjusted risk difference −6.4%, 95% CI −10.4% to −2.4%). Of the 328 participants who had a genital infection, 151 (98%) of 154 in the ceftriaxone group and 163 (94%) of 174 in the gentamicin group had clearance at follow-up (adjusted risk difference −4.4%, −8.7 to 0). For participants with a pharyngeal infection, a greater proportion receiving ceftriaxone had clearance at follow-up (108 [96%] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 82 [80%] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference −15.3%, −24.0 to −6.5). Similarly, a greater proportion of participants with rectal infection in the ceftriaxone group had clearance (134 [98%] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 107 [90%] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference −7.8%, −13.6 to −2.0). Thus, we did not find that a single dose of gentamicin 240 mg was non-inferior to a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg for the treatment of gonorrhoea, when both drugs were combined with a 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. The side-effect profiles were similar between groups, although severity of pain at the injection site was higher for gentamicin (mean visual analogue pain score 36 of 100 in the gentamicin group vs 21 of 100 in the ceftriaxone group).

Interpretation

Gentamicin is not appropriate as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea but remains potentially useful for patients with isolated genital infection, or for patients who are allergic or intolerant to ceftriaxone, or harbour a ceftriaxone-resistant isolate. Further research is required to identify and test new alternatives to ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea.

The only current CDC-recommended options for treating Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections are from a single class of antibiotics, the cephalosporins. Within this class, ceftriaxone, available only as an injection, is the recommended treatment for all types of gonorrhea infections (i.e., urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal). The only oral agent recommended currently by CDC for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea is a single dose of cefixime 400 mg. Availability of cefixime had been limited since July 2002, when Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Collegeville, Pennsylvania) discontinued manufacturing cefixime tablets in the United States. Beginning in April 2008, cefixime (Suprax) 400 mg tablets are again available in the United States.

### Ceftriaxone-resistant gonorrhea-China, 2022 [^111mp3D3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, remains prevalent worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 82.4 million new gonorrhea cases were diagnosed among persons aged 15–49 years in 2020. † In China, a total of 96,313 gonorrhea cases were reported in 2022, representing a rate of 6.83 reported cases per 100,000 population, the fourth highest among class A and class B notifiable infectious diseases § in the country, after viral hepatitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and syphilis. In the United States, in 2022, a total of 648,056 cases of gonorrhea were reported.

In recent years, gonococcal resistance to multiple antibiotics has emerged. Ceftriaxone is recommended as the first-line treatment option for gonorrhea in China (single dose of 1 g, administered intramuscularly) †† as well as in the United States (single dose of 500 mg for persons weighing < 150 kg, administered intramuscularly). §§ However, the emergence of ceftriaxone-resistant strains, particularly the ceftriaxone-resistant clone FC428, has been identified worldwide. First identified in Beijing in 2016, this resistant clone has become widely disseminated across various regions of China, with its proportion among all resistant clones steadily increasing since 2016, highlighting the challenge associated with addressing gonococcal resistance.

The China Gonococcal Resistance Surveillance Program (China-GRSP), established in 1987, monitors gonococcal resistance to azithromycin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, spectinomycin, and tetracycline in China. This report describes gonococcal resistance surveillance data from China for 2022, the most recent year for which data are available.

### Gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-ToG): a randomised non-inferiority trial [^111na7BY]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection for which ceftriaxone is the current first-line treatment, but antimicrobial resistance is emerging. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of gentamicin as an alternative to ceftriaxone (both combined with azithromycin) for treatment of gonorrhoea.

Methods

G-ToG was a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment with gentamicin to treatment with ceftriaxone for patients with gonorrhoea. The patients, treating physician, and assessing physician were masked to treatment but the treating nurse was not. The trial took place at 14 sexual health clinics in England. Adults aged 16–70 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of uncomplicated genital, pharyngeal, or rectal gonorrhoea. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular dose of either gentamicin 240 mg (gentamicin group) or ceftriaxone 500 mg (ceftriaxone group). All participants also received a single 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by clinic and performed using a secure web-based system. The primary outcome was clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at all initially infected sites, defined as a negative nucleic acid amplification test 2 weeks post treatment. Primary outcome analyses included only participants who had follow-up data, irrespective of the baseline visit N gonorrhoeae test result. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was a lower confidence limit of 5% for the risk difference. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN51783227.

Findings

Of 1762 patients assessed, we enrolled 720 participants between Oct 7, 2014, and Nov 14, 2016, and randomly assigned 358 to gentamicin and 362 to ceftriaxone. Primary outcome data were available for 306 (85%) of 362 participants allocated to ceftriaxone and 292 (82%) of 358 participants allocated to gentamicin. At 2 weeks after treatment, infection had cleared for 299 (98%) of 306 participants in the ceftriaxone group compared with 267 (91%) of 292 participants in the gentamicin group (adjusted risk difference -6.4%, 95% CI -10.4% to -2.4%). Of the 328 participants who had a genital infection, 151 (98%) of 154 in the ceftriaxone group and 163 (94%) of 174 in the gentamicin group had clearance at follow-up (adjusted risk difference -4.4%, -8.7 to 0). For participants with a pharyngeal infection, a greater proportion receiving ceftriaxone had clearance at follow-up (108 [96%] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 82 [80%] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference -15.3%, -24.0 to -6.5). Similarly, a greater proportion of participants with rectal infection in the ceftriaxone group had clearance (134 [98%] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 107 [90%] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference -7.8%, -13.6 to -2.0). Thus, we did not find that a single dose of gentamicin 240 mg was non-inferior to a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg for the treatment of gonorrhoea, when both drugs were combined with a 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. The side-effect profiles were similar between groups, although severity of pain at the injection site was higher for gentamicin (mean visual analogue pain score 36 of 100 in the gentamicin group vs 21 of 100 in the ceftriaxone group).

Interpretation

Gentamicin is not appropriate as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea but remains potentially useful for patients with isolated genital infection, or for patients who are allergic or intolerant to ceftriaxone, or harbour a ceftriaxone-resistant isolate. Further research is required to identify and test new alternatives to ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea.

Treatment Outcomes

The primary protocol-defined endpoint was met overall and in both treatment groups (Table 3).

Table 3.
Summary of Bacterial Eradication by Culture for Urogenital, Pharyngeal, and Rectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the Microbiologically Evaluable Population

Microbiological success for urogenital gonorrhea was achieved by 97%, 95%, and 96% of participants (lower 1-sided exact 95% CI bound, 85.1%, 84.7%, and 89.1%, respectively) for the 1500-mg, 3000-mg, and combined dose groups, respectively. The ME population included 2 women, 1 in each treatment group, both of whom were microbiological successes for urogenital NG. Three participants (4%; 1 participant who received 1500 mg and 2 participants who received 3000 mg) were microbiological failures.

Analysis of subgroups was limited because the majority of study participants were in the age group of 18 to 64 years and were men. Only 2 participants had pharyngeal NG at baseline, both in the 3000-mg treatment group; 1 participant was a microbiological success and the other participant was a microbiological failure (Table 3). All 3 participants with rectal NG at baseline were microbiological successes, with 1 participant in the 1500-mg treatment group and 2 participants in the 3000-mg treatment group (Table 3). All microbiological failures received standard-of-care ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and azithromycin 1 g orally per national treatment guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111h55ha]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae — During 2007, emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in the United States prompted CDC to cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea treatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining class of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in the United States. CDC's 2010 STD treatment guidelines recommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin plus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for C. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment; however, during 2006–2011 the minimum concentrations of cefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth increased, and CDC no longer recommends cefixime as a first-line regimen. Since 2013, the proportion of GISP isolates with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥ 2.0 μg/mL) has increased almost tenfold, to 5.1% in 2019, and emergence is not concentrated among certain populations. With the exception of a small cluster among seven patients during 2016 with azithromycin resistance and reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone, all gonorrhea strains identified by GISP are susceptible to either or both azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime. Azithromycin has unique pharmacokinetic properties that might predispose to resistance development because of its prolonged half-life, and consequently only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating gonorrhea in the United States. Clinicians remaining vigilant for treatment failures is paramount, and CDC plans to continue to monitor for changing ceftriaxone MICs until additional antimicrobials or a vaccine is available.

### Adherence to CDC recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea-STD surveillance network, United States, 2016 [^1165qhXn]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea, the sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is the second most common notifiable disease in the United States after chlamydia; 468,514 cases were reported to state and local health departments in 2016, an increase of 18.5% from 2015. N. gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to most antimicrobials used to treat the infection. As a result, CDC recommends two antimicrobials (250 mg of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g of azithromycin [PO]) for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea to improve treatment efficacy and, potentially, to slow the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. To monitor adherence to the current CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, CDC reviewed enhanced data collected on a random sample of reported cases of gonorrhea in seven jurisdictions participating in the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) and estimated the proportion of patients who received the CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, by patient characteristics and diagnosing facility type. In 2016, the majority of reported patients with gonorrhea (81%) received the recommended regimen. There were no differences in the proportion of patients receiving the recommended regimen by age or race/ethnicity; however, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in STD (91%) or family planning/reproductive health (94%) clinics were more likely to receive this regimen than were patients diagnosed in other provider settings (80%). These data document high provider adherence to CDC gonorrhea treatment recommendations in specialty STD clinics, indicating high quality of care provided in those settings. Local and state health departments should monitor adherence with recommendations in their jurisdictions and consider implementing interventions to improve provider and patient compliance with gonorrhea treatment recommendations where indicated.

### Gonorrhoea [^1144Rarp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, diagnoses rates for gonorrhoea in 2005 were 196/100,000 for 20–24 year old men, and 133/100,000 for 16–19 year old women. Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is reported in 10–40% of people with gonorrhoea in the USA and UK.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for uncomplicated infections in men and non-pregnant women; and in pregnant women? What are the effects of treatments for disseminated gonococcal infection? What are the effects of dual treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic regimens (dual treatment, multiple dose, single dose).

### Committee opinion no. 645: dual therapy for gonococcal infections [^114fWEkK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with an estimated 820,000 new Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections occurring each year. Antimicrobial resistance limits treatment success, heightens the risk of complications, and may facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to the sulfonamides, the tetracyclines, and penicillin. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin remains the only recommended first-line regimen for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together on the same day, preferably simultaneously, and under direct observation. Pregnant women who are infected with N gonorrhoeae should be treated with the recommended dual therapy. A test-of-cure is not needed for individuals diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with the recommended or alternative regimens. Repeat N gonorrhoeae infection is prevalent among patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for gonorrhea in the preceding several months. Most of these infections result from reinfection; therefore, clinicians should advise patients with gonorrhea to be retested 3 months after treatment. Pregnant women with antenatal gonococcal infection should be retested in the third trimester unless recently treated.

Resistance to one or more antimicrobial agent is reported in more than one quarter of isolates. Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is reported in 10% to 40% of people with gonorrhoea in the US and UK.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for uncomplicated infections in men and non-pregnant women; and in pregnant women? What are the effects of treatments for disseminated gonococcal infection? What are the effects of dual treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia infection?

### The use of gentamicin for treatment of urogenital and extragenital gonorrhea: a systematic review of efficacy data [^114hPhxF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate clinical efficacy data for gentamicin in the treatment of gonorrhea.

Data Sources

A keyword search of PubMed (1966 to April 2020), EMBASE (1947 to April 2020), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to April 2020) was conducted. The electronic search was supplemented with manual screening of references from identified articles and a search of ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Comparator and noncomparator studies reporting microbiological outcomes of treatment with gentamicin for gonorrhea in humans were included. Data extracted included study year, authors, aim, setting, population, dosing protocols, and outcome results. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.

Data Synthesis

A total of 407 articles were identified, of which 11 met inclusion criteria. Two studies were randomized controlled trials, and 1 additional randomized noncomparator study was identified. All other studies were nonrandomized and noncomparator in nature. The highest quality evidence suggests that gentamicin is not noninferior to ceftriaxone (both in addition to azithromycin) for treatment of gonorrhea but may achieve cure rates > 90%. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the efficacy of gentamicin-based regimens for the specific treatment of extragenital gonorrhea.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Results of this review could affect patient care and clinical practice because they clearly demonstrate the role of gentamicin for the treatment of gonorrhea as a second-line agent. Future research should confirm findings, especially for the role of gentamicin in extragenital infections.

Conclusions

Gentamicin-based regimens should be reserved for second-line treatment of urogenital and extragenital gonorrhea infections.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113NnukQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose has been demonstrated to be 99.2% effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea (95% CI: 97.3%–99.9%). However, monotherapy is not recommended because of concerns about the ease with which N. gonorrhoeae can develop resistance to macrolides, the high proportion of isolates with azithromycin decreased susceptibility, and documented azithromycin treatment failures. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible to penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides (e.g. erythromycin), and thus use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended.

Spectinomycin is effective (98.2% in curing uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections) but has poor efficacy for pharyngeal infections. It is unavailable in the United States, and the gentamicin alternative regimen has replaced the need for spectinomycin, if a cephalosporin allergy exists, in the United States.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Pharynx

The majority of gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common among certain populations (,–). Although these infections rarely cause complications, they have been reported to be a major source of community transmission and might be a driver of antimicrobial resistance. Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than infections at urogenital and anorectal sites. Few antimicrobial regimens reliably cure > 90% of gonococcal pharyngeal infections. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonorrhea about oral sexual exposure; if reported, pharyngeal testing should be performed.

Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Pharynx Among Adolescents and Adults
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered.

If chlamydial infection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome) to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections remain a significant public health concern with most cases occurring in adults younger than 25 years old. Diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification testing as this is the most sensitive and specific test. Treatment with doxycycline or ceftriaxone is recommended for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively. Expedited partner therapy is cost-effective and acceptable by patients as a means to reduce transmission. Test of cure is indicated in persons at risk for reinfection or during pregnancy.

Neonates born to mothers who have gonococcal infection — screening and presumptive treatment for those without signs: Neonates born to mothers who have untreated gonorrhea are at high risk for infection, and neonates should be tested for gonorrhea at exposed sites (e.g., conjunctiva, vagina, rectum, and oropharynx) and treated presumptively for gonorrhea. For neonates without signs of gonococcal infection, the recommended regimen is Ceftriaxone 20–50 mg/kg body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 250 mg. Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, especially those born prematurely, and Cefotaxime 100 mg/kg body weight IV or IM as a single dose can be administered for those neonates unable to receive ceftriaxone because of simultaneous administration of IV calcium.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone sodium, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

Bacterial Septicemia

Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter species.

Intra-abdominal Infections

Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species (Note: most strains of Clostridium difficile are resistant) or Peptostreptococcus species.

Meningitis

Caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone has also been used successfully in a limited number of cases of meningitis and shunt infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis * and Escherichia coli*.

*Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than ten infections.

Surgical Prophylaxis

The preoperative administration of a single 1 g dose of ceftriaxone may reduce the incidence of postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy or cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis in high-risk patients, such as those over 70 years of age, with acute cholecystitis not requiring therapeutic antimicrobials, obstructive jaundice or common duct bile stones) and in surgical patients for whom infection at the operative site would present serious risk (e.g., during coronary artery bypass surgery). Although ceftriaxone has been shown to have been as effective as cefazolin in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery, no placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate any cephalosporin antibiotic in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery.

When administered prior to surgical procedures for which it is indicated, a single 1 g dose of ceftriaxone provides protection from most infections due to susceptible organisms throughout the course of the procedure.

Emerging Antimicrobial Drug–Resistant N. gonorrhoeae

N. gonorrhoeae has adapted to treatment through all mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial drug–resistant N. gonorrhoeae has outpaced novel treatment options; the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone is among the most recent drugs currently being prescribed for treatment against gonorrhea. Gonococcal resistance to penicillin and tetracycline was first reported in Asia during the 1970s; resistance became widespread in multiple regions of the world during the early 1980s. High levels of resistance to quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) developed by the mid-2000s; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) removed these drugs from recommended treatment regimens for gonorrhea in 2007. Public health agencies in most countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend treating gonorrhea with ceftriaxone in combination with azithromycin in an attempt to slow simultaneous emergence of AMR to 2 unrelated compounds. However, recent reports suggest that this combination is becoming less effective in treating gonorrhea.

### Antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^117P3JMh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The incidence of gonorrhea is increasing in developed countries and remains high elsewhere. This untenable disease burden, the complication rate in women and newborns, and the amplification of human immunodeficiency virus transmission that accompanies gonorrhea makes control of gonococcal disease a priority. However, antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has severely compromised the successful treatment of gonorrhea. Older therapies are ineffective, whereas those that remain efficacious are unaffordable in many high-incidence settings. Penicillins, tetracyclines, and newer macrolides have limited utility, and spectinomycin (and in many parts of the world, quinolones) have been withdrawn because of resistance. Of the usually recommended treatments, only the third-generation cephalosporins, and most notably ceftriaxone, have retained their efficacy, but decreased susceptibility to these antibiotics has also appeared. A sustained decrease in gonococcal disease requires an integrated approach combining improved prevention, better diagnosis, and effective treatment. Without continued commitment and effort, gonorrhea may well become untreatable.

In one clinical trial, dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100% of cases (lower one-sided 95% CI bound: 98.5%) and can be considered an alternative to ceftriaxone for persons with cephalosporin allergy. This trial was not powered enough to provide reliable estimates of the efficacy of these regimens for treatment of rectal or pharyngeal infection; however, this regimen cured the few extragenital infections among study participants. Notably, gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily vomiting < 1 hour after dosing, occurred among 3%–4% of persons treated with gentamicin plus azithromycin, necessitating retreatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. A similar trial that studied gentamicin 240 mg plus azithromycin 1 g determined lower cure rates at extragenital sites; 80% (95% CI: 72%–88%) of pharyngeal and 90% (95% CI: 84%–95%) of rectal infections were cured with this regimen. Gemifloxacin plus azithromycin has been studied and is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial stewardship concerns.

An 800-mg oral dose of cefixime should be considered only as an alternative cephalosporin regimen because it does not provide as high, nor as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as a 500-mg IM dose of ceftriaxone. Furthermore, it demonstrates limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3% cure; 95% CI: 74.9%–99.1%); in older clinical studies, cefixime cured 97.5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections (95% CI: 95.4%–99.8%). The increase in the prevalence of isolates obtained through GISP with elevated cefixime MICs might indicate early stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal resistance to cephalosporins. Changes in cefixime MICs can result in decreasing effectiveness of cefixime for treating urogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes less effective, continued used of cefixime might hasten the development of resistance to ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, injectable cephalosporin and the last antimicrobial known to be highly effective in a single dose for treatment of gonorrhea at all anatomic infection sites. Other oral cephalosporins (e.g. cefpodoxime and cefuroxime) are not recommended because of inferior efficacy and less favorable pharmacodynamics.

### Ampicillin sodium [^111fyK5f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months.

The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate.

Bacterial Meningitis

Adults and children – 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 3 to 4 hours. (Treatment may be initiated with intravenous drip therapy and continued with intramuscular injections.) The doses for other infections may be given by either the intravenous or intramuscular route.

Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) - Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3.

TABLE 3: Dosage in Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) for Bacterial Meningitis and Septicemia:

Septicemia

Adults and children – 150 to 200 mg/kg/day. Start with intravenous administration for at least three days and continue with the intramuscular route every 3 to 4 hours.
