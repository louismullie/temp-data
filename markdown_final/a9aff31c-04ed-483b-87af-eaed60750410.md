## Question

Can caloric restriction induce apoptosis in cancer cells?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether caloric restriction can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct evidence that caloric restriction increases markers of apoptosis in tumors. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of that evidence across tumor types and models. Next, I will examine the mechanistic plausibility, including IGF-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, AMPK, and immune-mediated effects. After that, I need to consider counterexamples where caloric restriction does not increase apoptosis or may even be protective to cancer cells. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically relevant conclusion and highlight key caveats and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence. In acute myeloid leukemia models, caloric restriction initially increases apoptosis, with a modest rise in cleaved caspase-3 positivity in leukemic blasts, alongside cell-cycle restriction and inhibition of TOR and insulin/IGF1 signaling, indicating a bona fide pro-apoptotic effect early on [^112MQQH5] [^117LPt3g]. In mammary carcinomas, energy restriction induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, evidenced by increased caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax and Apaf-1, with concurrent reduction in Akt phosphorylation, reinforcing a causal link between nutrient restriction and intrinsic apoptosis [^11276vAR]. In a glioma model, 40% caloric restriction decreased tumor growth and increased apoptosis within the tumor, correlating with reduced IGF-1 and glucose, again supporting a direct pro-apoptotic effect in at least some solid tumors [^115FhhU4]. Hold on, I should verify that these are preclinical findings; yes, these data are largely from animal models and cell systems, not definitive human trials, so I need to keep that limitation in mind [^116Hquyw].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility. Caloric restriction lowers circulating glucose, insulin, and IGF-1, which reduces PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and can tilt the balance toward apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells, while normal cells often enter protective maintenance states, a phenomenon termed differential stress resistance/sensitization [^116Qj3fe] [^111fxvUf]. I should confirm that AMPK activation under nutrient stress can promote apoptosis in some contexts; indeed, AMPK activation can engage p53 and other stress pathways that favor apoptosis, though its role is context-dependent and not universally pro-death in tumors [^116anyJ7] [^113impLH]. Let me also consider immune effects: daily caloric restriction can remodel immunity by increasing CD8+ and CD4+ T cell cytotoxic potential and reducing immunosuppressive populations, which may indirectly facilitate cancer cell death, although this is not purely a cell-autonomous apoptosis mechanism [^116LV248].

> But wait, what if caloric restriction sometimes fails to increase apoptosis or even helps cancer cells survive? I need to check for counterexamples. In AML, after an initial pro-apoptotic phase, caloric restriction selects for leukemia-initiating cells with downregulated dsRNA sensing and interferon signaling, enabling relapse unless combined with LSD1 inhibition, which restores interferon signaling and triggers massive RNASEL-dependent apoptosis, indicating that CR alone is insufficient to eradicate disease in this setting [^117LPt3g] [^115St8wu]. In B-cell ALL, fasting can be beneficial, but in AML models, fasting or dietary restriction may not help and could even be ineffective, underscoring lineage-specific metabolic and signaling differences that modulate apoptotic responses to nutrient stress [^111jHrZN]. Hold on, I should also verify that low glucose can paradoxically protect some cancer cells from apoptosis under certain therapeutic stresses; indeed, glucose limitation can protect cells from pyrimidine-restriction–induced apoptosis by suppressing BAK activation and mitochondrial apoptosis, highlighting a context where nutrient restriction does not increase and may decrease apoptosis [^112YAUsv]. Let me reconsider autophagy as well; autophagy is often upregulated by CR and can be cytoprotective in established tumors, so CR-induced autophagy may buffer against apoptosis in some contexts, complicating a simple "CR equals apoptosis" conclusion [^114ac9Nd] [^1179MrGq].

> I should double-check the clinical translational data. In humans, short-term caloric restriction or fasting is generally safe and lowers IGF-1, insulin, and glucose, but robust evidence that CR alone increases tumor apoptosis in patients remains limited; for example, a short-term preoperative weight-loss intervention in prostate cancer did not significantly change the apoptotic index in malignant epithelium despite metabolic improvements, reminding me not to over-extrapolate from animals to humans [^113MbdQy] [^113i5eLn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the DIRECT trial showed increased apoptosis; let me verify that. The DIRECT trial primarily demonstrated feasibility and potential enhancement of chemotherapy response with a fasting-mimicking diet, but it did not directly demonstrate increased tumor apoptosis as an endpoint, so I should correct that assumption and avoid overstatement [^notfound].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Yes, caloric restriction can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, and there is direct evidence in specific models such as AML, mammary carcinomas, and glioma, with convergent mechanistic support via reduced IGF-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, AMPK-mediated stress responses, and immune remodeling. However, this effect is heterogeneous, context-dependent, and often modest or transient without combinatorial strategies, and in some tumors CR may select for adaptive survival programs that blunt or counteract apoptosis unless paired with targeted agents like LSD1 inhibitors or specific metabolic therapies [^112MQQH5] [^11276vAR] [^115FhhU4] [^117LPt3g] [^112YAUsv]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical practice. Given feasibility concerns, potential immune trade-offs, and tumor-specific variability, CR or fasting is best viewed as an adjunct within clinical trials rather than a standalone apoptosis-inducing therapy in patients [^116Qj3fe] [^116Hquyw].

Caloric restriction (CR) can **induce apoptosis in cancer cells** by lowering glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 [^111fxvUf], which weakens PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling [^117KsVBm] and activates AMPK, thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis [^notfound]. CR also increases oxidative stress and DNA damage in tumor cells [^116LQMUF], further driving apoptosis [^11276vAR]. However, **some cancer cells adapt to CR** [^117LPt3g] by upregulating autophagy [^114ac9Nd] or anti-apoptotic pathways, limiting apoptosis and enabling survival [^112YAUsv]. Thus, CR-induced apoptosis is context dependent and often modest; combining CR with targeted therapies or chemotherapy can enhance apoptosis and overcome resistance [^114Gws7K] [^111fxvUf].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction by caloric restriction

CR reduces energy availability and growth signaling, **activating pathways that promote apoptosis** in cancer cells:

- **Reduced glucose and insulin/IGF-1 signaling**: CR lowers glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 [^111NWm4w], inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and activating AMPK, which increases mitochondrial apoptosis [^117KsVBm].

- **Increased oxidative stress**: CR elevates ROS in tumor cells [^116LQMUF], causing DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction that trigger intrinsic apoptosis [^11276vAR].

- **Activation of pro-apoptotic proteins**: CR increases Bax and Apaf-1 while decreasing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, shifting the balance toward apoptosis [^11276vAR].

- **Immune-mediated effects**: CR enhances T cell cytotoxicity and reduces immunosuppressive cells, indirectly promoting tumor cell death [^116LV248].

---

## Evidence from preclinical studies

Multiple preclinical models show that **CR increases apoptosis** in cancer cells:

| **Cancer type** | **Model** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Breast cancer | Mouse models | CR increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth [^11276vAR] [^111UHU5w] |
| Leukemia | Mouse models | CR induced apoptosis and reduced leukemic burden [^112MQQH5] [^117LPt3g] |
| Colon cancer | Rat models | CR increased apoptosis and reduced tumor incidence [^notfound] |
| Prostate cancer | Mouse models | CR increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth [^116hRfCM] |

---

These studies indicate that **CR can induce apoptosis** across diverse cancer types, though the magnitude varies with tumor genetics and microenvironment [^115VN6MX].

---

## Limitations and variability in apoptotic response

Despite these findings, **CR-induced apoptosis is variable**:

- **Tumor heterogeneity**: Genetic and metabolic differences among tumors create variability in apoptotic sensitivity to CR [^116Hquyw].

- **Adaptive responses**: Some tumors upregulate autophagy [^114ac9Nd] or anti-apoptotic pathways (e.g. Bcl-2, XIAP) [^111W4sTh], limiting apoptosis under CR [^115St8wu].

- **Dose and duration**: The apoptotic effect depends on the degree and duration of caloric restriction; excessive restriction can cause cachexia and immune suppression, potentially offsetting benefits [^116Sz8PT].

---

## Combination therapies enhancing apoptosis

CR is often **combined with other therapies** to overcome resistance and enhance apoptosis:

- **Chemotherapy**: CR sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy via differential stress sensitization [^111fxvUf], increasing apoptosis while protecting normal cells [^116LQMUF].

- **Targeted therapies**: Combining CR with agents like LSD1 inhibitors [^117LPt3g] or PI3K/MEK inhibitors [^notfound] can reactivate apoptotic pathways and induce tumor cell death.

- **Immunotherapy**: CR enhances immune-mediated tumor clearance, potentially improving immunotherapy outcomes [^111AZz2L] [^116LV248].

---

## Clinical evidence and feasibility

Clinical data are limited; **small studies suggest** that intermittent fasting or fasting-mimicking diets are safe and feasible [^111B1QVc], lowering glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 [^111fxvUf] and potentially enhancing treatment responses. However, larger trials are needed to confirm these effects and define optimal regimens [^114Gws7K].

---

Caloric restriction can **induce apoptosis in cancer cells** through metabolic and signaling changes, but the response is modest and context dependent. Combining CR with targeted therapies or chemotherapy can enhance apoptosis and overcome resistance, supporting its role as an adjunctive strategy in oncology [^112MQQH5] [^117LPt3g].

### Fasting cycles retard growth of tumors and sensitize a range of cancer cell types to chemotherapy [^116LQMUF]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Short-term starvation (or fasting) protects normal cells, mice, and potentially humans from the harmful side effects of a variety of chemotherapy drugs. Here, we show that treatment with starvation conditions sensitized yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expressing the oncogene-like RAS2(val19) to oxidative stress and 15 of 17 mammalian cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents. Cycles of starvation were as effective as chemotherapeutic agents in delaying progression of different tumors and increased the effectiveness of these drugs against melanoma, glioma, and breast cancer cells. In mouse models of neuroblastoma, fasting cycles plus chemotherapy drugs — but not either treatment alone — resulted in long-term cancer-free survival. In 4T1 breast cancer cells, short-term starvation resulted in increased phosphorylation of the stress-sensitizing Akt and S6 kinases, increased oxidative stress, caspase-3 cleavage, DNA damage, and apoptosis. These studies suggest that multiple cycles of fasting promote differential stress sensitization in a wide range of tumors and could potentially replace or augment the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of various cancers.

### Energy disruptors: rising stars in anticancer therapy? [^114xarVX]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

When the nutrient supply is low, cells slow their metabolism to inhibit anabolic reactions and avoid energy shortage and death through the inhibition of mTORC1. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the main sensor of energy in cells. An increase in the AMP/ATP ratio induces the activation of AMPK. AMPK phosphorylates and activates tuberous sclerosis 2, the negative regulator of mTOR. This signal opposes the effects of Akt and acts as a potent inhibitor of mTORC1. AMPK is a major adaptive kinase and a heterotrimeric enzyme complex; it comprises one catalytic α-subunit and two regulatory β and γ subunits. Upon an energy stress, AMP and ADP bind to the γ-subunit and induce a conformational change that enhances its activity and the phosphorylation on Thr 172 by the liver kinase B1 (LKB1). LKB1 is the upstream kinase required for the activation of AMPK in response to an energy stress. LKB1 is somatically mutated in some non-small-cell lung cancer and cervical carcinoma. Furthermore, germline mutations of LKB1 are responsible for the Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, which is characterized by the development of gastrointestinal and oral lesions. Importantly, AMPK can also be phosphorylated in response to calcium flux independently of LKB1 by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2. In addition, MAPKKK TAK1/MAP3K7 has been reported to phosphorylate Thr 172 of AMPK.

Considering the importance of the energy supply for cancer cells, the considerable interest in molecules interfering with the energy levels of cells is not surprising. Indeed, the induction of a strong energy stress in cancer cells leads to a major depletion of ATP, and consequently, to cell death. In this review, we will focus on three different promising molecules that interfere with energy cell metabolism: (i) biguanides (metformin and phenformin), used for the treatment of type II diabetes, (ii) 2-deoxyglucose, a potent inhibitor of glycolysis and (iii) Acadesine, also known as AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide), an energy restriction mimetic agent.

Conclusions

Dietary interventions are attractive as inexpensive supportive anticancer therapies. CR is an established tumor preventative regimen, reducing systemic inflammation and growth factor signaling, as well as improving metabolic markers. Improved metabolism and inflammation are also likely mechanisms through which CR may reduce tumor growth and enhance therapeutic response (Fig. 1). In addition, oncogenic transformation and loss of senescence in cancer cells may render them more sensitive to CR than normal cells (Fig. 1). As chronic CR is contraindicated for many cancer patients at risk for weight loss, cachexia, and immunosuppression, intermittent CR, fasting-mimicking diets, low carbohydrate/ketogenic diets, or CR mimetic drugs may be more suitable. Fasting and low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce side effects and to improve chemotherapy and radiation therapy in animal models, and there is great promise for these interventions in the clinic. More preclinical studies are required to determine in which cancers, at which stage, and in what combinations CR mimetic drugs may prove most effective. Future studies should take into consideration (1) the risk of cachexia in a patient population, whereby those at high risk may benefit from a ketogenic diet or short-term fasting; (2) the immunologic state of the enrolled patients, when CR or rapamycin treatment may be detrimental to wound healing or inflammatory responses; and (3) the metabolic state of patients, with diabetic patients in particular being at risk of adverse effects during chronic CR or fasting regimens, whereby treatment with metformin or a ketogenic diet may be of benefit. While in the short-term studies will need to focus on the safety and added benefit to current therapies, future studies may also focus on the potential of CR in enhancing the response to lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In summary, CR and its mimetics show promise as supportive anticancer therapies. Clinical studies are ongoing and will inform on the potential use of these dietary and drug treatments alongside conventional treatments.

### Fasting vs dietary restriction in cellular protection and cancer treatment: from model organisms to patients [^117RCWa5]. Oncogene (2011). Low credibility.

The dietary recommendation for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, as described by the American Cancer Society, is to increase calorie and protein intake. Yet, in simple organisms, mice, and humans, fasting — no calorie intake — induces a wide range of changes associated with cellular protection, which would be difficult to achieve even with a cocktail of potent drugs. In mammals, the protective effect of fasting is mediated, in part, by an over 50% reduction in glucose and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels. Because proto-oncogenes function as key negative regulators of the protective changes induced by fasting, cells expressing oncogenes, and therefore the great majority of cancer cells, should not respond to the protective signals generated by fasting, promoting the differential protection (differential stress resistance) of normal and cancer cells. Preliminary reports indicate that fasting for up to 5 days followed by a normal diet, may also protect patients against chemotherapy without causing chronic weight loss. By contrast, the long-term 20 to 40% restriction in calorie intake (dietary restriction, DR), whose effects on cancer progression have been studied extensively for decades, requires weeks-months to be effective, causes much more modest changes in glucose and/or IGF-I levels, and promotes chronic weight loss in both rodents and humans. In this study, we review the basic as well as clinical studies on fasting, cellular protection and chemotherapy resistance, and compare them to those on DR and cancer treatment. Although additional pre-clinical and clinical studies are necessary, fasting has the potential to be translated into effective clinical interventions for the protection of patients and the improvement of therapeutic index.

### Two parallel pathways connect glutamine metabolism and mTORC1 activity to regulate glutamoptosis [^11152wWr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Glutamoptosis is the induction of apoptotic cell death as a consequence of the aberrant activation of glutaminolysis and mTORC1 signaling during nutritional imbalance in proliferating cells. The role of the bioenergetic sensor AMPK during glutamoptosis is not defined yet. Here, we show that AMPK reactivation blocks both the glutamine-dependent activation of mTORC1 and glutamoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We also show that glutamine is used for asparagine synthesis and the GABA shunt to produce ATP and to inhibit AMPK, independently of glutaminolysis. Overall, our results indicate that glutamine metabolism is connected with mTORC1 activation through two parallel pathways: an acute alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent pathway; and a secondary ATP/AMPK-dependent pathway. This dual metabolic connection between glutamine and mTORC1 must be considered for the future design of therapeutic strategies to prevent cell growth in diseases such as cancer.

### Do cancer and cancer treatments accelerate aging? [^111Gta1m]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on describing the mechanisms and clinical manifestations that underlie accelerated aging associated with cancer and its treatment.

Recent Findings

The direct and indirect effects of cancer and its treatment are associated with late occurrence of comorbidities that happen earlier or more frequently in cancer survivors compared to cancer-free individuals, otherwise known as accelerated aging. Use of senolytics and dietary and exercise interventions including prehabilitation, caloric restriction, and rehabilitation are currently under investigation to reverse or decelerate the aging process and will be covered in this review. Further research on how to decelerate or reverse aging changes associated with cancer and its treatment will be of paramount importance as the number of cancer survivors continues to grow.

Differential stress resistance

During shot-term fasting (STF), normal healthy cells and cancer cells respond differently to chemotherapeutic agents. This phenomenon is termed differential stress resistance (DSR). In normal healthy cells, nutrient deprivation inactivated growth-promoting pathways to prioritize maintenance and repair pathways, leading to increase cellular protection and resistance to multiple stresses. In cancer cells, however, growth-promoting pathways remain over activated and unable to activate the protective response, contributing to less resistance to stress and more vulnerability to chemotherapeutic agents. Because of these differential responses of healthy versus cancer cells to STF, chemotherapy causes more DNA damage and apoptosis in tumor cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed when combined with STF.

Fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)

Considering the potential adverse effects of CR and fasting in some cancer patients, pharmacological agents that mimic CR, such as rapamycin, metformin, and resveratrol, could serve as effective alternatives to achieve the protective effects of CR. In animal models, a fasting-mimicking diet showed a similar reduction in tumor progression as short-term starvation. The administration of the CR mimetic rapamycin (sirolimus), achieved mTOR inhibition, extended lifespan, and delayed cancer in mice. Another CR mimetic, metformin, was shown to suppress tumor development and growth in multiple experimental models, including colon, mammary, and hematopoietic cancer models.

Recently, Caffa et al. showed that in mouse models of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, periodic fasting or an FMD enhanced the endocrine therapeutics activity of tamoxifen and fulvestrant by lowering circulating IGF1, insulin, and leptin and by inhibiting AKT-mTOR signaling. The authors also showed that in patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer receiving estrogen therapy, cycles of an FMD cause metabolic changes like those observed in mice.

Alternative dietary approaches

Dietary regimens, such as a low carbohydrate/ketogenic diet, promote ketones derived from fatty acids as energy sources rather than glucose. Such dietary interventions were also shown to reduce tumor growth in several tumor cell models. Moreover, there is preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the assumption that ketogenic therapy through fasting and ketogenic diets can enhance radiotherapy.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^117WT3FU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The AMPK/mTOR axis also controls autophagy, a process through which proteins, macronutrients and organelles are enveloped in double-membraned vesicles and degraded into building blocks that can then be shuttled into synthetic pathways. Under CR conditions, AMPK activation stimulates increased autophagy to recycle cellular components and provide needed substrates for metabolism and homeostasis. Autophagy can act as a double-edged sword in cancer – it is thought to be tumor suppressive since defects in autophagy drive oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, DNA damage, genomic instability, and tumor growth. Conversely, it is believed to be tumor promoting because established tumors can utilize autophagy to reduce oxidative stress and increase mitochondrial function and metabolism in order to promote survival and overcome stress and low nutrient conditions. Due to the dual role of autophagy in cancer, autophagy inducers and inhibitors have become targets for cancer therapy. Recent research in our lab showed that combining autophagy inhibition with a CR regimen reduced tumor growth more than either treatment alone.

Furthermore, increasing preclinical and human evidence suggests that CR reduces inflammation. Multiple inflammatory signaling cascades can promote the growth and survival of neoplastic cells. The reduction of energy intake in CR reduces the amount of adipose tissue, a major endocrine organ that secretes pro-inflammatory factors including leptin, adiponectin, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6. CR in human studies is associated with reduced adiposity and a lessened inflammatory adipose secretome, as well as particularly decreased systemic levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines. In addition, CR has been shown to consistently reduce the expression of the pro-angiogenic factors vascular endothelial factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, both of which induce the growth of new blood vessels to provide growing tumors with oxygen and glucose. CR has also been shown to reduce vascularization of tumors. In addition to altering systemic inflammatory mediators, CR has been shown reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in cancer cells, including nuclear factor kappa B and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, which are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in regulating inflammation, proliferation, and glucose and lipid homeostasis and often expressed in cancer cells.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^116LV248]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A key feature of this work is the demonstration that daily CR results in a more pronounced reduction in primary tumor growth than caloric cycling. This finding was consistently observed whether mice started CR and caloric cycling (LCC and FMD) pre- or post-4T1 implantation. A significant reduction in the tumor proliferative capacity (e.g. mitotic count) was achieved only in animals on increasing levels of daily CR (20– > 40%). Therefore, it appears that daily CR and other less stringent forms of CR can limit tumor progression, a conclusion also reached by others.

Another key observation was the identification of immune remodeling in response to daily CR in peripheral tissues. Earlier work has suggested that upregulation of immune-fighting T-cells, specifically CD8 + and CD4 +, leads to slower tumor growthand is a good indicator of survival outcome. Conversely, depletion of CD8 + partially eliminates CR-mediated delay in tumor growth. Here, our findings show that daily CR led to an increase in CD8 + and CD4 + cells in peripheral tissues. This is a key observation because T cell exhaustion is one of the major drivers of tumor progression and is indicative of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Prior work found that nutrient-rich environments (i.e. a high-fat diet) led to accelerated T-cell exhaustion in a breast cancer model, whereas nutrient deprivation promotes apoptosis in malignant cells. Within the TME of CR-fed mice, the number of CD4 + or CD8 + cells were not impacted, but their cytotoxic killing potential was elevated. Thus, CR may remodel the TME to dampen malignant cell growth while enhancing T cell proliferation and cytotoxic capacity. The capacity of daily CR to decrease the frequency of Foxp3 + CD8 +, Foxp3 + CD4 +, and MDSCs is consistent with protection from the metastatic potential of tumor cells –. These findings suggest that the immune phenotype elicited by daily CR may be exploited to target specific immune cells and provide opportunities for developing new therapeutic approaches. These alterations may contribute to the more robust cancer-fighting benefits observed with daily CR compared to caloric cycling.

### Cyclic fasting-mimicking diet in cancer treatment: preclinical and clinical evidence [^114Gws7K]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In preclinical tumor models, cyclic fasting and fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) produce antitumor effects that become synergistic when combined with a wide range of standard anticancer treatments while protecting normal tissues from treatment-induced adverse events. More recently, results of phase 1/2 clinical trials showed that cyclic FMD is safe, feasible, and associated with positive metabolic and immunomodulatory effects in patients with different tumor types, thus paving the way for larger clinical trials to investigate FMD anticancer activity in different clinical contexts. Here, we review the tumor-cell-autonomous and immune-system-mediated mechanisms of fasting/FMD antitumor effects, and we critically discuss new metabolic interventions that could synergize with nutrient starvation to boost its anticancer activity and prevent or reverse tumor resistance while minimizing toxicity to patients. Finally, we highlight potential future applications of FMD approaches in combination with standard anticancer strategies as well as strategies to implement the design and conduction of clinical trials.

### Fasting mimicking diet as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in the multicentre randomized phase 2 DIRECT trial [^111fxvUf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Extensive preclinical evidence suggests that short-term fasting and fasting mimicking diets (FMDs) can protect healthy cells against the perils of a wide variety of stressors, including chemotherapy, simultaneously rendering cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy and other therapies –. Essentially, fasting causes a switch in healthy cells from a proliferative state towards a maintenance and repair state. Malignant cells, in contrast, seem to be unable to enter this protective state because of oncoprotein activity, and therefore fail to adapt to nutrient scarce conditions. Instead, fasting deprives proliferating cancer cells of nutrients, growth and other factors, which renders them more sensitive to cancer therapy and increases cell death. The phenomenon by which normal but not cancer cells become protected to toxins is termed differential stress resistance (DSR), whereas the specific sensitization of cancer cells to stress is called Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS).

Declines of plasma levels of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin and glucose are among the mediators of the effects of fasting on cancer cells, as these factors can promote growth and prevent apoptosis –. Fasting periods of at least 48 h are required to induce a robust decrease in circulating glucose, IGF-1 and insulin levels. A very low calorie, low protein FMD was developed for its ability to cause metabolic effects on various starvation response markers similar to those caused by water-only fasting, while reducing the burden associated with a water only fast.

Small clinical studies showed that fasting as an adjunct to chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated, while it may reduce its toxicity –. This multicentre, open label, randomized DIRECT study was designed to evaluate the impact of an FMD on toxicity as well as on the radiological and pathological response to chemotherapy for breast cancer.

### Fasting and cancer: molecular mechanisms and clinical application [^116Qj3fe]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2018). Medium credibility.

The vulnerability of cancer cells to nutrient deprivation and their dependency on specific metabolites are emerging hallmarks of cancer. Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments. While fasting is hardly tolerated by patients, both animal and clinical studies show that cycles of low-calorie FMDs are feasible and overall safe. Several clinical trials evaluating the effect of fasting or FMDs on treatment-emergent adverse events and on efficacy outcomes are ongoing. We propose that the combination of FMDs with chemotherapy, immunotherapy or other treatments represents a potentially promising strategy to increase treatment efficacy, prevent resistance acquisition and reduce side effects.

### Adipocytes in hematopoiesis and acute leukemia: friends, enemies, or innocent bystanders? [^111jHrZN]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Caloric restriction is known to result in an increase of MAT. Interestingly, fasting or dietary restrictions improve the outcome of different cancer entities. A recent paper by Lu et al. demonstrates that this also applies to B-ALL and T-ALL, but not AML. Repeated cycles of 1 day fasting followed by 1 day of feeding shortly after transplantation of leukemia cells completely inhibited leukemia development in the N-Myc B-ALL model and massively decreased the leukemic burden in the Notch1 T-ALL model. Mechanistically, fasting led to an upregulation of Lepr expression and activation of the downstream signaling molecule PR/SET domain 1 in leukemic cells. In contrast, the dietary regime had no beneficial effect in the MLL-AF9 AML model. The authors speculate that AML cells have high basal expression levels of Lepr and might therefore be resistant to fasting-induced upregulation of this pathway. In ALL, fasting not only prevented leukemia development, but also resulted in differentiation and depletion of leukemic cells. Most importantly though, fasting also effectively inhibited the growth of human patient-derived B-ALL in a xenograft model and the expression of LEPR signaling-related genes was correlated to prognosis in pediatric pre-B-ALL. Clearly, these findings open up new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALL. It can be speculated that other fasting-responsive pathways are also major contributors, e.g. the IGF-1/IGF-1R growth hormone axis. The concept of treating leukemia by forcing terminal differentiation of the malignant cell instead of killing it was proposed 40 years ago (for review see). The findings by Lu et al. encourage the revival of this old concept from a new perspective: "starving leukemia to induce differentiation".

Review

Autophagy

To understand the relationship between energy restriction (ER) and cancer biology, a thorough insight of the autophagy is required. Autophagy is a catabolic process essential to support cellular homeostasis and survival in response to both physiologic and pathologic stimuli by involving degradation and recycling of cells' intracellular endogenous and exogenous components through the lysosomal machinery. This mechanism aids cell survival by providing primary materials including amino acids, fatty acids, nucleosides/nucleotides, sugars, and nucleosides/nucleotides during the state of cellular deprivation.

Autophagy operates at basal levels, and it can be induced in response to chemotherapeutic treatment and various cellular conditions including hypoxia, DNA damage, and nutrient depletion. In the past years, the dynamic role of autophagy has gained increasing attention as it could be a therapeutic target for several diseases, including cancer.

The preponderance of evidence indicated that autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis and inhibits cancer cell adaptation, proliferation, survival, and invasion or metastasis.

Several studies using animal models suggested that the tumor-suppressive mechanism by autophagy was associated with cellular responses from different types of stress, such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammation, and dysfunctional elements. While there is no evidence that autophagy contributes to cancer development, it may have a vital role in tumor survival and progression.

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been frequently observed in a wide range of human cancers, which also supports autophagy initiation to recycle intracellular components that subsequently promote tumor growth. Further studies have shown that the upregulation of autophagy is an important protection against chemotherapeutic agents, which is associated with treatment resistance.

Autophagy modulation may be considered a new therapeutic strategy in treating patients with cancer. The combination of autophagy inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1, chloroquine, or 3-methyladenine with standard agents has shown increased efficacy in treating tumor cells. Notably, inhibition of autophagy demonstrated an increase response to radiotherapy in ovarian and esophageal cancer, likely due to enhanced oxidative stress and DNA damage during short-term fasting on cancer cells. Although results from clinical trials have not found an association between autophagy inhibition and anticancer therapy, there are several approved agents known to modulate autophagy.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^115fygZ7]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Elegant work by Rafaghello et al. demonstrated that short-term fasting elicits differential responses to chemotherapy in normal and cancer cells, with normal cells inactivating growth signals, such as Ras, Akt and IGF-1, in response to short-term fasting protecting them from therapeutic toxicity. In contrast, cancer cells, which have arisen due to activation of these signals and evasion of senescence-inducing signals, do not undergo this inactivation, remaining vulnerable to cytotoxic treatment via chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The induction of these cancer-specific stress responses may impact mechanisms related to chemoresistance, including multidrug resistance.

More recently, a fasting-mimicking diet, in which mice are fed the same amount of food as control mice, albeit with a severely reduced caloric density, showed a similar reduction in tumor growth as short-term starvation and displayed synergistic therapeutic effects when combined with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Cycles of this diet have recently been shown to improve metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers associated with cancer risk in humans. Mechanistically, the synergizing effects of the fasting-mimicking diet were associated with increased autophagy in the cancer cells and reduced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the microenvironment, causing increased circulating CD8 + T cells and reduced T reg cells, and resulting in enhanced immunosurveillance and clearance of tumor cells. Moreover, prolonged cycles of fasting have also been shown to protect immune cells during chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting the possibility of combining immunotherapies with traditional chemotherapy alongside such dietary interventions. Similarly, CR also maintains immunological fitness of CD4 + T cells during aging to enhance cancer immunotherapy, specifically OX40-agonist immunotherapy. In addition, a CR regimen can reduce desmoplasia and the inflammatory microenvironment of tumors, previously shown to impede the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the tumor cells.

### Synergistic effect of fasting-mimicking diet and vitamin C against KRAS mutated cancers [^113d9Nad]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fasting-mimicking diets delay tumor progression and sensitize a wide range of tumors to chemotherapy, but their therapeutic potential in combination with non-cytotoxic compounds is poorly understood. Here we show that vitamin C anticancer activity is limited by the up-regulation of the stress-inducible protein heme-oxygenase-1. The fasting-mimicking diet selectivity reverses vitamin C-induced up-regulation of heme-oxygenase-1 and ferritin in KRAS-mutant cancer cells, consequently increasing reactive iron, oxygen species, and cell death; an effect further potentiated by chemotherapy. In support of a potential role of ferritin in colorectal cancer progression, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas Database indicates that KRAS mutated colorectal cancer patients with low intratumor ferritin mRNA levels display longer 3- and 5-year overall survival. Collectively, our data indicate that the combination of a fasting-mimicking diet and vitamin C represents a promising low toxicity intervention to be tested in randomized clinical trials against colorectal cancer and possibly other KRAS mutated tumors.

### NRF2, cancer and calorie restriction [^115opKNw]. Oncogene (2011). Low credibility.

The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (NRF2) is a key regulator of several enzymatic pathways, including cytoprotective enzymes in highly metabolic organs. In this review, we summarize the ongoing research related to NRF2 activity in cancer development, focusing on in vivo studies using NRF2 knockout (KO) mice, which have helped in defining the crucial role of NRF2 in chemoprevention. The lower cancer protection observed in NRF2 KO mice under calorie restriction (CR) suggests that most of the beneficial effects of CR on the carcinogenesis process are likely mediated by NRF2. We propose that future interventions in cancer treatment would be carried out through the activation of NRF2 in somatic cells, which will lead to a delay or prevention of the onset of some forms of human cancers, and subsequently an extension of health- and lifespan.

### ONC212 is a novel mitocan acting synergistically with glycolysis inhibition in pancreatic cancer [^113L9XZk]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

ONC212 is a fluorinated imipridone with preclinical efficacy against pancreatic and other malignancies. Although mitochondrial protease ClpP was identified as an ONC212-binding target, the mechanism leading to cancer cell death is incompletely understood. We investigated mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic rewiring triggered by ONC212 in pancreatic cancer, a deadly malignancy with an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We found ClpP is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and is required for ONC212 cytotoxicity. ClpX, the regulatory binding partner of ClpP, is suppressed upon ONC212 treatment. Immunoblotting and extracellular flux analysis showed ONC212 impairs oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with decrease in mitochondrial-derived ATP production. Although collapse of mitochondrial function is observed across ONC212-treated cell lines, only OXPHOS-dependent cells undergo apoptosis. Cells relying on glycolysis undergo growth arrest and upregulate glucose catabolism to prevent ERK1/2 inhibition and apoptosis. Glucose restriction or combination with glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose synergize with ONC212 and promote apoptosis in vitro and in vivo Thus, ONC212 is a novel mitocan targeting oxidative metabolism in pancreatic cancer, leading to different cellular outcomes based on divergent metabolic programs.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^115St8wu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our results reveal a yin-yang effect of CR on CR-responsive tumors: despite eliciting short-term tumor growth inhibition, CR favors survival of cells with stem-cell features that cause the delayed emergence of a more aggressive disease. The "persistent" phenotype is associated with and possibly caused by the LSD1-dependent downregulation of exhaustion- and death-inducing innate immune pathways (IFN, dsRNA sensing).

Specific points of pathway crosstalk appear as targetable vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Importantly, targeting each of these hubs individually is insufficient to cause disease eradication. CR and, in particular, insulin/IGF1 inhibition slows down the cell cycle and thus global tumor growth, but at the same time attenuates responsiveness to innate immune pathways that would induce cancer stem-cell clearance, favoring their persistence. Thus, upon CR, pro-survival and death-promoting stimuli are equally tuned down, resetting the system to a lower degree of activity with slower cell proliferation but preserved survival. However, if dsRNA sensing is activated cell-intrinsically through LSD1 inhibition, cancer cells in CR are unable to sufficiently upregulate anti-apoptotic factors like CFLAR, due to a global decrease in translation rate, and eventually die. Our data suggest that none of the main signals emanating from insulin/IGF1 receptor (PI3K, MEK, mTOR) is, by itself, sufficient to sensitize cells to LSD1 inhibition and dsRNA-mediated cell death. However, concerted inhibition of at least PI3K and MEK is required. Recent studies show evidence of synergism between mTOR and LSD1 inhibition in other systems, so further research is needed to clarify the specific dependence.

### Autophagic cell death restricts chromosomal instability during replicative crisis [^111WgUDK]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Replicative crisis is a senescence-independent process that acts as a final barrier against oncogenic transformation by eliminating pre-cancerous cells with disrupted cell cycle checkpoints 1. It functions as a potent tumour suppressor and culminates in extensive cell death. Cells rarely evade elimination and evolve towards malignancy, but the mechanisms that underlie cell death in crisis are not well understood. Here we show that macroautophagy has a dominant role in the death of fibroblasts and epithelial cells during crisis. Activation of autophagy is critical for cell death, as its suppression promoted bypass of crisis, continued proliferation and accumulation of genome instability. Telomere dysfunction specifically triggers autophagy, implicating a telomere-driven autophagy pathway that is not induced by intrachromosomal breaks. Telomeric DNA damage generates cytosolic DNA species with fragile nuclear envelopes that undergo spontaneous disruption. The cytosolic chromatin fragments activate the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) pathway and engage the autophagy machinery. Our data suggest that autophagy is an integral component of the tumour suppressive crisis mechanism and that loss of autophagy function is required for the initiation of cancer.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^116Dbrvc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The positive association between tumor progression and splenic accumulation of tumor-promoting immune cells (splenomegaly)led us to measure spleen mass, which was markedly lower in mice on daily CR and cycles of FMD or LCC (Fig. 2l). We surmise that the decrease in tumor growth could be stemming, at least in part, from a drop in the number of tumor-promoting immune regulatory cells. None of the dietary interventions were capable at reducing tumor viability as assessed in Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained tumor whole slide images (Fig. 2m). These outcomes are important because of the growing interest in pairing dietary regimens with current standard cancer treatments, including chemotherapy. Thus, the reduction in calorie intake and/or extended periods of fasting appear to be the key drivers of tumor growth decline, regardless of diet composition. However, daily CR was more effective than 4:10 cycles of FMD and LCC at delaying 4T1 tumorigenesis in vivo, even though they underwent a similar degree of calorie restriction.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^111n2VGf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Calorie restriction (CR) and cancer

CR, a chronic reduction of dietary energy intake by approximately 30% without incurrence of malnutrition, is a broadly effective dietary intervention that significantly decreases adiposity and inflammation and improves metabolic profiles in non-obese humans and rodents. Preclinical studies in mammalian models demonstrate that CR extends lifespan, ameliorates risk factors, and delays onset of age-related diseases, including cancer, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In response to decreased caloric intake, metabolic alterations foster health promoting characteristics, including increased insulin sensitivity and decreased blood glucose, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and angiogenesis. While the impact of CR on age-related pathologies has been studied most extensively in rodent models, data from human observational and randomized clinical trials demonstrate that CR in non-obese humans results in metabolic and molecular changes similar to those observed in rodent models. Within the scope of cancer research, a meta-analysis of preclinical rodent models evaluated the impact of CR across multiple cancer types and through a variety of tumor models; overall, CR displayed a 75.5% reduction in tumor incidence. Longitudinal studies at the National Institute of Ageing and the University of Wisconsin showed a significant reduction in the incidence of cancers in rhesus monkeys fed a CR diet compared to a control diet. While the antitumorigenic effects of CR are well established, the mechanism behind this relationship remains unclear, though it is believed that the tumor suppressive effects are mediated, in part, by enhanced apoptosis within tumors, modulation of systemic signals such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, insulin, metabolic and inflammatory pathways, as well as by reduced angiogenesis.

### Roles of circadian clocks in cancer pathogenesis and treatment [^112VUHxP]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent studies, nutritional interventions have been increasingly thought to improve circadian rhythms and health. Indeed, mouse studies have revealed that circadian molecular and metabolic profiles altered by aging are reverted by caloric restriction (CR), a well-known antiaging dietary intervention. In addition to its antiaging benefits, increasing preclinical evidence indicates that CR may have anticancer effects by reducing tumor progression, enhancing the death of cancer cells, and elevating the effectiveness and tolerability of chemo- and radiotherapies. Nonetheless, it is increasingly recognized that chronic CR often has detrimental effects on tumor development and chemotherapy in cancer patients, possibly by negatively affecting the immune system, wound healing, and other important functions. As an alternative, intermittent fasting (IF), a diet-based therapy that alternates between fasting and free feeding/eating for a period of time, has been reported to inhibit tumor growth and improve antitumor immune responses in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, IF can increase cancer sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and reduce the side effects of traditional anticancer treatments. Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that well-designed chronodietary intervention holds promise as a potential therapeutic regimen to counter cancer, with fewer side effects and more safety.

Along with diet, exercise is gaining emerging attention as a potential chronotherapeutic intervention strategy for the prevention and treatment of multiple disease processes. Notably, increasing numbers of human studies have revealed the therapeutic benefits of exercise in cancer treatment and survival. Compared to mice treated with chemotherapy alone, mice treated with exercise plus chemotherapy presented with delayed tumor growth in models of breast cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. However, most of these studies were performed without considering the effects of exercise timing on these disease processes. In this regard, a recent, population-based, case-control study reports that those who exercise in the early morning may have reduced risks of developing prostate or breast cancer than those who exercise in the evening. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate how the timing of exercise influences cancer progression and chemotherapeutic outcomes with more mechanistic approaches.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^113JJ2VS]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We then investigated whether sensitization to extrinsic apoptosis depends on activation of the dsRNA-sensing machinery, by silencing the critical mediator RNASEL, using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in WT or LSD1-KO NB4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a). RNAseL depletion abolished the sensitivity of NB4 LSDKO + OSI-906 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 8b).

CFLAR mediates CR-induced sensitization to apoptosis

We then investigated why LSD1i-induced apoptosis depends so critically on the concomitant blockade of the insulin/IGF1 pathway. TRAIL triggers extrinsic apoptosis through FADD-dependent activation of caspase-8, −10, −3and the DISC death-inducing signaling complex. Consistently, OSI-906 markedly increased TRAIL-induced caspase3 activation in LSD1-KO NB4 cells (Supplementary Fig 8c, d). Notably, cell death was dependent on both caspase-3 and −8 activation, as pan-caspase (Z-VAD-FMK), caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK) or −8 (Z-IETD-FMK) inhibitors were all equally capable to rescue TRAIL-induced death in OSI-906 treated LSD1-KO NB4 cells (Fig. 5f). The CFLAR (CASP8 and FADD Like Apoptosis Regulator) competes with procaspase-8 in the formation of DISC and is a potent inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Notably, CFLAR is a key point of metabolic control of apoptosis, since it requires de novo protein synthesis, and is down-regulated under limited nutrient conditions. CFLAR was down-regulated in mouse APL blasts upon CR in vivo (Fig. 5g, h). In NB4, LSD1-KO NB4 and NPM1c+ cells in vitro, treatment with OSI-906 led to reduced CFLAR levels in response to TRAIL stimulation (Fig. 5i-j and Supplementary Fig. 8e). We also noticed that pharmacological LSD1 ablation per se leads to some degree of CFLAR downregulation, which may further contribute to the pharmacological synergy (Fig. 5i).

### MTORC1 inhibition in cancer cells protects from glutaminolysis-mediated apoptosis during nutrient limitation [^113N1evy]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

A master coordinator of cell growth, mTORC1 is activated by different metabolic inputs, particularly the metabolism of glutamine (glutaminolysis), to control a vast range of cellular processes, including autophagy. As a well-recognized tumour promoter, inhibitors of mTORC1 such as rapamycin have been approved as anti-cancer agents, but their overall outcome in patients is rather poor. Here we show that mTORC1 also presents tumour suppressor features in conditions of nutrient restrictions. Thus, the activation of mTORC1 by glutaminolysis during nutritional imbalance inhibits autophagy and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Importantly, rapamycin treatment reactivates autophagy and prevents the mTORC1-mediated apoptosis. We also observe that the ability of mTORC1 to activate apoptosis is mediated by the adaptor protein p62. Thus, the mTORC1-mediated upregulation of p62 during nutrient imbalance induces the binding of p62 to caspase 8 and the subsequent activation of the caspase pathway. Our data highlight the role of autophagy as a survival mechanism upon rapamycin treatment.

### Suppression of apoptosis: role in cell growth and neoplasia [^115CGqSG]. Leukemia (2001). Low credibility.

A cell is a potentially dangerous thing. In unicellular organisms, cells divide and multiply in a manner that is chiefly determined by the availability of nutritional substrates. In a multicellular organism, each cell has a distinct growth potential that is designed to subsume a role in the function of the whole body. Departure from this path to one of uncontrolled cellular proliferation leads to cancer. For this reason, evolution has endowed cells with an elaborate set of systems that cause errant cells to self-destruct. This process of cell suicide is known as apoptosis or programmed cell death and it plays a crucial role in the growth of both normal and malignant cells. In this review, we describe the mechanisms whereby programmed cell death is induced and executed. In particular, we concentrate on how anti-apoptotic signals generated by cytokines promote cell survival and how these signal transduction pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of neoplasia. Understanding how these processes contribute to tumorigenesis may suggest new therapeutic options.

### AMPK and p53 help cells through lean times [^116anyJ7]. Cell Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^111UHU5w]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

CR is without a doubt the most robust non-pharmacological intervention against induced and spontaneous cancers. Numerous studies have shown the ability of daily CR to delay neoplasia in multiple tissues and inhibit the growth of chemically induced and spontaneous tumors, including breast cancer. Despite the far-reaching improvements in healthand reduction in cancer incidenceassociated with daily CR, its long-term implementation is not a feasible approach for most humans. Implementation of protocols that involve IF as clinically viable alternatives to daily CR has been shown to promote similar improvements in metabolic markers, provide protection against cancer growth, and improve the response of a 4T1 murine cancer model to chemotherapy. However, it is unclear whether optimization of diet composition in these less stringent feeding regimens would provide equal or better protection against tumor growth as daily CR. In this work, we begin to address this knowledge gap by directly assessing the effects of cycles of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) vs. daily CR.

Periodic cycles of fasting/FMD followed by AL refeeding have been demonstrated to be a promising approach for treating cancer, both alone and in combination with either chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy –. Several clinical trials have reported successful outcomes; however, important questions remain about the extent to which the composition of the FMD diet contributes to the observed beneficial effects and whether the effects of this form of caloric cycling can be as protective as daily CR against tumor growth and metastasis. Previous studies indicated that protein restriction, independent of calorie consumption, can delay the growth of certain tumors. Here, we demonstrate that cycles of very low caloric intake either with AIN-93G chow (LCC) or a plant-based diet (FMD) were equally effective at delaying primary 4T1 tumor growth in young BALB/cJ females, a finding consistent with previous studies indicating that the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells, contrary to other types of cancer, is not affected by protein restriction and the consequent lowering of IGF-1.

Fig. 1
Mechanisms through which calorie restriction (CR) affects response to anticancer therapy. CR, fasting, or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) cause reduced Akt/mTOR and Ras signaling in normal cells, resulting in senescence, reduced growth, and protection from cytotoxic treatment, while in tumor cells, oncogenic signals remain and cells are sensitive to anti-mitotic therapies. CR, fasting, and FMD also reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the circulation and in the tumor microenvironment niche, as well as reduced leptin, insulin, IGF-1, and glucose. CR can reduce desmoplasia surrounding the tumor tissue, which may facilitate better therapeutic drug delivery to the tumor cells. CR can also aid in immunosurveillance of tumors by reducing T reg populations that inhibit cytotoxic CD8 + T cells. This figure has not been published elsewhere

### Inhibition of malic enzyme 1 disrupts cellular metabolism and leads to vulnerability in cancer cells in glucose-restricted conditions [^114zW77D]. Oncogenesis (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, we demonstrated that ME1 is an essential enzyme that regulates cellular metabolism and redox balance. We also showed that, in glucose-depleted conditions, cancer cells become dependent on the ME1 flux to produce NADPH and pyruvate and to manage redox homeostasis, suggesting that these cells become vulnerable to reduced ME1 activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ME1 inhibition suppresses cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis or senescence depending on the cellular context, consistent with previous reports, and that tumours in a nutrient-limited microenvironment are a sensitive target for ME1 inhibition. No ME1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, although a few small-molecule ME2 inhibitors were discovered in pre-clinical trials. A treatment strategy combining ME1 inhibitors with inhibition of glycolysis, NADPH-producing enzymes, or redox-regulating enzymes would provide an effective therapeutic option for some types of cancer. Further work is required in animal models to assess if such a strategy would be effective in tumours.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^112yFdmv]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

CR mimetics

Given the nutritional concerns of CR and fasting in some cancer patients, CR mimetics, namely pharmacological agents that target pathways affected by CR, such as rapamycin, metformin, resveratrol, and hydroxycitrate, are attractive strategies to mimic the protective effects of CR both for cancer prevention and as adjuvant therapies without dietary restriction. These CR mimetics affect systemic and tumor-specific inflammation and metabolism, and targeting these pathways may sensitize cancers to traditional and emerging anti-cancer therapies by reducing tumor-associated inflammation or causing metabolic stress in the cancer cell.

Administration of the CR mimetic rapamycin (sirolimus), an immunosuppressant drug and established inhibitor of mTOR, extends lifespan and delays cancer in mice. Our lab has shown that rapamycin or its analog, Afinitor® (everolimus), can mimic the anticancer effects of CR in mouse models of pancreatic and breast cancer. Signaling via the mTOR pathway has been implicated in a broad range of chemoresistant cancers, and rapamycin has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance. Promising preclinical studies demonstrate that rapamycin can sensitize certain cancers to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Active phase I and II clinical trials are ongoing to determine the effect of combining rapamycin with chemotherapeutic regimens, including gemcitabine for osteosarcoma, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone in myeloma, and mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine for leukemia.

### Targeting metabolism for cancer treatment and prevention: metformin, an old drug with multi-faceted effects [^113wrqhj]. Oncogene (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding the complexity of cancer and of the underlying regulatory networks provides a new paradigm that tackles cancer development and treatment through a system biology approach, contemporarily acting on various intersecting pathways. Cancer cell metabolism is an old pathogenetic issue that has recently gained new interest as target for therapeutic approaches. More than 70 years ago, Warburg discovered that malignant cells generally have altered metabolism with high rates of glucose uptake and increased glycolysis, even under aerobic condition. Observational studies have provided evidence that impaired metabolism, obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may have a role in cancer development, progression and prognosis, and actually diabetic and obese patients have increased cancer risk. On the other hand, caloric restriction has been shown to prolong life span and reduce cancer incidence in several animal models, having an impact on different metabolic pathways. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug widely used for over 40 years, mimics caloric restriction acting on cell metabolism at multiple levels, reducing all energy-consuming processes in the cells, including cell proliferation. By overviewing molecular mechanisms of action, epidemiological evidences, experimental data in tumor models and early clinical study results, this review provides information supporting the promising use of metformin in cancer prevention and treatment.

### Adipocytes in hematopoiesis and acute leukemia: friends, enemies, or innocent bystanders? [^117Mwny5]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

It is very obvious that the key alterations induced by fasting are related to altered function of AT. A decrease in leptin and a subsequent upregulation of Lepr was already identified as protective mechanism in B-ALL and T-ALL development. It will be important to identify other adipocyte-secreted factors that contribute to the beneficial effects of fasting in cancer therapy in general and in leukemia in particular. Leukemia develops in the BM. Thus, the effect of fasting on BM adipocytes needs to be dissected in detail. For example, a recent paper by Attané et al. described that BM adipocytes display distinct metabolic characteristics with an absence of lipolytic activity and a shift toward a cholesterol-oriented metabolism. How this impacts on the interaction between BM adipocytes and leukemia needs to be investigated. It is also important to find out why fasting seems to be beneficial in ALL, but not AML. This might be related to different metabolic demands and signaling capacities of lymphoid and myeloid cells. Most importantly, we should aim at investigating whether fasting itself is required or if the fasting procedure can be mimicked by pharmacological agents, the polyphenolic compound resveratrol (RSV) being a prominent example. RSV inhibits adipogenic differentiation and the expression of proinflammatory factors from adipocytes. At the same time, RSV sensitizes leukemia cells to apoptosis induction. It is conceivable that RSV also influences the interaction of both cell types in the local niche. Metformin is another promising candidate in this regard — it molecularly mimics caloric restriction, reduces the cancer incidence in both mice and humans and, of note, reduces MAT. By the way, comparable considerations may also apply to exercise. Physical exercise is beneficial during and after cancer treatment and leads to the loss of WAT mass and, importantly, also MAT.

### Epigenetic regulation of caloric restriction in aging [^115MrE3R]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aging and its direct consequences, such as degenerative diseases and even death, are inevitable; however, scientific advances in understanding basic aging mechanisms have made it much more feasible to postpone aging processes and to increase the human lifespan using clinical approaches. Current studies using model organisms indicate that aging processes can be manipulated by many interacting factors which include, but are not limited to, geneticnutritional and pharmacological interventions. Studies of monozygotic twins, who share the same genotype and often present many phenotypic differences, indicate that external environmental factors contribute to interindividual differences such as susceptibility to disease and the potential to live longer.

Dietary control, as a major environmental factor, has a profound effect on many aspects of health, including aging, and caloric restriction (CR) is by far the most effective environmental manipulation that can extend maximum lifespan in many different species. In fact, the remarkable effect of CR on aging was first defined in experimental animal models in which McCay et al. discovered that rats fed a calorie-restricted diet lived longer than control rats fed a regular diet. Since then, numerous research findings have revealed effects of CR on lifespan interference among diverse, but not all eukaryotes, including yeast, worms, flies, fish and even mammals. In most rodent CR studies, the limitation of total calories derived from carbohydrates, fats or proteins to a level 25% to 60% below that of control animals fed ad libitum, while containing all essential nutrients, can result in a significant lifespan extension in 50% of rodents. In addition to increasing lifespan in rodents, CR has also been shown to delay a wide range of aging-associated diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases in higher mammals, such as nonhuman primates and humans (Table 1). The incidence of disease increases with age and is a fundamental contributor to mortality. Thus, CR may affect aging processes by favorably influencing broad aspects of human health.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^117KsVBm]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure to an energy restricted diet results in reduced systemic glucose and growth factors such as IGF-1. Preclinical studies in breast, pancreatic, and colon cancer have demonstrated that modulation of IGF-1 signaling plays a major role in CR's anticancer effects. In alignment with this, population studies have demonstrated that the IGF-1 signaling pathway plays a significant role in the development and progression of many cancer types. IGF-1 is a nutrient-responsive growth factor that activates two major signaling cascades, namely Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT. Activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway promotes activity of transcription factors and subsequent expression of genes involved in proliferation and cellular growth. Initiation of the PI3K/AKT pathway promotes decreased apoptosis by disrupting the BCL2-Bad complex, increases protein synthesis via mTOR activation, and increases glucose metabolism by inhibiting GSK-3β. Cancer cells utilize the IGF-1 signaling pathway to redirect their metabolic investment towards proliferation and growth, and thus reduction of IGF-1 levels in CR results in decreased tumor growth and progression. Addition of exogenous IGF-1 leads to the partial reversal of the anticancer effects of CR, further supporting the role of IGF-1 in tumorigenesis. In addition, expression of signaling factors downstream of IGF-1 has been correlated with either resistance or sensitivity to several cancer therapies. Nevertheless, although IGF-1 signaling is a promising anticancer target, drugs targeting the pathway have been largely unsuccessful.

CR also induces activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a molecular sensor that increases catabolism and inhibits anabolic metabolism, working in opposition to IGF-1-mediated activation of mTOR. AMPK activation in response to CR conditions results in increased apoptosis within brain tumors while protecting normal cells from the stress. AMPK induces expression of metabolic control genes, including SIRT1, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis to provide auxiliary substrates when glucose is scarce. In line with this, CR results in elevated serum glutamine and ketone bodies. Many tumors undergo metabolic reprogramming, including enhanced fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis in addition to increased glucose metabolism. Some cancers can therefore become autonomous, uncoupling their growth from the availability of systemic factors under normal conditions. Despite it not being clear whether administration of CR would support tumor growth in these circumstances, it is thought that transformed cells lack the metabolic adaptability to respond to altered substrate availability, having already invested heavily in metabolic reprograming and thus being more sensitive to increased pressure on ketone metabolism and fatty acid oxidation than normal cells.

### Energy and caloric restriction, and fasting and cancer: a narrative review [^114zt8kn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer cells

Cancer cells demonstrate an increase in anabolic reactions that give rise to the so-called Warburg effect. Tumor cells consume large amounts of glucose even in conditions in which oxidative phosphorylation can proceed unrestrictedly, they are also able to take up large amounts of amino acids, and they are avid consumers of lipids. Studies with the human subjects found that long-term caloric restriction (CR) have significant reductions in metabolic and hormonal factors that are likely to be associated with the risk of developing cancer.

Energy restriction (ER), caloric restriction (CR), intermittent energy restriction (IER), and fasting and cancer

There are two most common types of energy restriction (ER), the caloric restriction (CR) or continuous energy restriction (CER) and the intermittent energy restriction (IER). The IER encompasses a variety of fasting patterns, including intermittent fasting, periodic fasting, alternate-day fasting, fasting-mimicking diet (FMD), or time-restricted feeding. Fasting is defined as complete food deprivation except to drink water, with intervals of regular food intake. CR is distinct from fasting in which average daily caloric intake reduces by 20–40% without malnutrition or deprivation of essential nutrients.

In response to ER, metabolic changes induce health-promoting effects, including increased insulin sensitivity and decreased blood glucose, growth factor signaling, inflammation, angiogenesis, and protection against oxidative stress. Exposure to an ER diet results in reduced systemic glucose and growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, and the latter is known to play a significant role in the development and progression of tumors through the activation of two major signaling cascades, namely Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT. CR also induces activation of AMP-activated protein that results in increased apoptosis. Fasting has also been shown to cause an anti-Warburg effect and promote apoptosis in vitro cancer models.

The National Institute of Ageing Studies showed that the incidence of cancers in rhesus monkeys fed a CR diet is reduced compared to that in animals fed a control diet. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ER significantly enhanced the efficacy of several chemotherapeutic agents. It has been postulated that fasting may improve anticancer therapies' effectiveness in part by controlling the circadian rhythm. In several animal models, intermittent fasting combined with chemotherapy show enhanced suppression of tumor growth and improved overall survival. In xenograft malignancies in mice, tumor growth was slower in response to chemotherapy combined with a 24–60 h fast compared to chemotherapy alone. Fasting also has significant benefits in terms of reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy treatment.

### Translating energy balance research from the bench to the clinic to the community: parallel animal-human studies in cancer [^115XCsM4]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

Expansion of research is needed in multiple areas within the context of cancer, diet, and weight-loss interventions. The best measures for the effect of weight-related changes on cancer have not yet been established, although several are being evaluated: weight, body composition, BMI, metabolic disruption, diet, and biomarkers. The best dietary approaches (composition and delivery; e.g. intermittent fasting vs. continuous caloric restriction) to achieve weight loss or improved cancer outcomes are unclear. The timing of these interventions should also be studied. Timing may also influence comorbidities, quality of life, and cost. The mechanisms underlying changes at the molecular level provide ample opportunity for preclinical and parallel studies. Distribution of knowledge to stakeholders will be critical as knowledge expands, with attention to ensuring access to underserved groups, including racial, ethnic, and sexual/gender minorities; those in rural areas; and patients with understudied cancers.

### Developing dietary interventions as therapy for cancer [^116Hquyw]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Cancer cells acquire distinct metabolic preferences based on their tissue of origin, genetic alterations and degree of interaction with systemic hormones and metabolites. These adaptations support the increased nutrient demand required for increased growth and proliferation. Diet is the major source of nutrients for tumours, yet dietary interventions lack robust evidence and are rarely prescribed by clinicians for the treatment of cancer. Well-controlled diet studies in patients with cancer are rare, and existing studies have been limited by nonspecific enrolment criteria that inappropriately grouped together subjects with disparate tumour and host metabolic profiles. This imprecision may have masked the efficacy of the intervention for appropriate candidates. Here, we review the metabolic alterations and key vulnerabilities that occur across multiple types of cancer. We describe how these vulnerabilities could potentially be targeted using dietary therapies including energy or macronutrient restriction and intermittent fasting regimens. We also discuss recent trials that highlight how dietary strategies may be combined with pharmacological therapies to treat some cancers, potentially ushering a path towards precision nutrition for cancer.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^112CRAZe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Earlier work has shown that short periods of very low caloric intake, including either periods of short-term fasting (2–4 days) or dietary manipulation of specific macronutrients, can be effective at delaying primary tumor growth. Conversely, excess consumption of animal-derived protein is linked with increased cancer risk and all-cause mortality. Different forms of intermittent fasting (IF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF), are broadly characterized by cyclical periods of low caloric intake or complete fasting interspersed between periods of ad libitum (AL) feeding. IF and TRF result in a dramatic reduction in tumor growth, and have garnered traction both as an adjuvant to chemotherapy and as a tool for cancer prevention with promising translational applications.

Periods of prolonged fasting result in decreased circulating blood glucose and IGF-1 signaling in target tissues, thus dampening tumor growth. Under low glucose conditions, normal cells undergo growth arrest, whereas malignant cells no longer respond to these conditions and maintain uncontrolled cell division. Consequently, a striking difference in the response of normal and cancerous cells to chemotherapy under fasting conditions has emerged, whereby normal cells, but not cancer cells, are protected from the cell-killing actions of anticancer drugs. Therefore, much interest has centered on developing dietary approaches that recapitulate the selective targeting of cancer cells without the burden of CR. A plant-based diet, recently designed to mimic the physiological response to fasting ('fasting mimicking diet', FMD), was developed to minimize the burden of fasting while providing adequate micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc.), and to elicit beneficial improvements in metabolic parameters. Periodic cycles (4-day cycle twice a month) of FMD followed by AL feeding promote health span in mice and humansand confer protection against primary tumorigenesis, with or without chemotherapy –. This approach was also demonstrated to lower toxicity to chemotherapy in clinical trials.

### Impact of intermittent fasting on patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and / or targeted therapies: a systematic review of the literature [^111B1QVc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intermittent fasting holds potential for improving cancer patient outcomes by promoting cancer cell death. Additionally, it depletes hepatic glycogen reserves, facilitating the release of fatty acids and ketones, which may enhance cancer cells sensitivity to chemotherapy and impede their proliferation. However, clinical data on fasting among cancer patients remain scarce. This systematic review intends to provide an overview of the impact of intermittent fasting on the safety, feasibility, tolerability, and metabolic effects of chemotherapy and targeted therapies in cancer patients.

Methods

Articles were retrieved from 1990 to March 2025, employing a defined search equation. Established endpoints included cancer development, treatment efficacy, side effects related to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, quality of life, and fasting tolerance. Risk of bias was assessed, utilizing a validated assessment tool.

Results

Among 1,725 articles, nine met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was low to moderate. These studies included patients predominantly with breast cancer (n = 258/354). Even though the safety and feasibility of intermittent fasting were confirmed, no impact on treatment outcomes and chemotherapy-related toxicities was demonstrated. However, a consistent trend emerged in reduced insulin and IGF-1 levels, along with increased erythrocyte levels among fasting patients. Three studies reported no significant difference in body weight and BMI.

Conclusion

Current evidence indicates that intermittent fasting is both safe and feasible. However, due to the lack of robust evidence, a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of intermittent fasting on treatment effectiveness and side effects related to chemotherapy and targeted therapies in cancer patients cannot be drawn. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate intermittent fasting as an adjunctive therapeutic approach.

### Intermittent fasting in the prevention and treatment of cancer [^116v5tZ3]. CA (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic caloric restriction (CR) has powerful anticarcinogenic actions in both preclinical and clinical studies but may be difficult to sustain. As an alternative to CR, there has been growing interest in intermittent fasting (IF) in both the scientific and lay community as a result of promising study results, mainly in experimental animal models. According to a survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation, IF has become the most popular diet in the last year, and patients with cancer are seeking advice from oncologists about its beneficial effects for cancer prevention and treatment. However, as discussed in this review, results from IF studies in rodents are controversial and suggest potential detrimental effects in certain oncologic conditions. The effects of IF on human cancer incidence and prognosis remain unknown because of a lack of high-quality randomized clinical trials. Preliminary studies suggest that prolonged fasting in some patients who have cancer is safe and potentially capable of decreasing chemotherapy-related toxicity and tumor growth. However, because additional trials are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of fasting for patients with cancer, the authors would not currently recommend patients undergoing active cancer treatment partake in IF outside the context of a clinical trial. IF may be considered in adults seeking cancer-prevention benefits through means of weight management, but whether IF itself affects cancer-related metabolic and molecular pathways remains unanswered.

### Caloric restriction ketogenic diets (KR) in relation to radiotherapy responses in lung cancer xenografts… [^116UMkqt]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract e20528 Background: Dietary interventions can change metabolite levels in the tumour microenvironment, which might then affect cancer cell metabolism to alter tumour growth. Caloric restriction and ketogenic diet are often thought to limit tumour progression. The current study tests the hypothesis that caloric restriction ketogenic diets enhance radiotherapy responses in lung cancer xenografts. Methods: Mice bearing Lewis Lung Carcinoma xenografts were randomly divided into ad libitum diet group, radiation group, KR diet group, or KR + RT group. Mice in KR and KT group were fed a KR. Mice in RT and KT group were treated with radiation. Mice weights, tumor size, blood ketone levels and survival were monitored. Results: Blood ketone levels were significantly higher for the mice consuming a KR diet compared to standard diet. Some mice with KR diet lost a significant amount of weight by the end of the treatment. The KR diets combined with radiation resulted in slower tumor growth in Lewis Lung Carcinoma xenografts and longer survival time, relative to radiation alone. The KR diet also slowed tumor growth and prolonged survival, relative to control. Hematological and pathological examinations indicated that the KR diet was safe and well tolerated, and no significant cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicity was observed. Conclusions: These results showed that a KR diet enhanced radiotherapy responses in lung cancer xenografts. Further studies are needed to address the mechanism of this diet intervention.

### Glucose limitation protects cancer cells from apoptosis induced by pyrimidine restriction and replication inhibition [^112YAUsv]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Cancer cells often experience nutrient-limiting conditions because of their robust proliferation and inadequate tumour vasculature, which results in metabolic adaptation to sustain proliferation. Most cancer cells rapidly consume glucose, which is severely reduced in the nutrient-scarce tumour microenvironment. In CRISPR-based genetic screens to identify metabolic pathways influenced by glucose restriction, we find that tumour-relevant glucose concentrations (low glucose) protect cancer cells from inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, a pathway that is frequently targeted by chemotherapy. We identify two mechanisms to explain this result, which is observed broadly across cancer types. First, low glucose limits uridine-5-diphosphate-glucose synthesis, preserving pyrimidine nucleotide availability and thereby prolonging the time to replication fork stalling. Second, low glucose directly modulates apoptosis downstream of replication fork stalling by suppressing BAK activation and subsequent cytochrome c release, key events that activate caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis. These results indicate that the low glucose levels frequently observed in tumours may limit the efficacy of specific chemotherapeutic agents, highlighting the importance of considering the effects of the tumour nutrient environment on cancer therapy.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^1133NTW1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Caloric Restriction (CR) has established anti-cancer effects, but its clinical relevance and molecular mechanism remain largely undefined. Here, we investigate CR's impact on several mouse models of Acute Myeloid Leukemias, including Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, a subtype strongly affected by obesity. After an initial marked anti-tumor effect, lethal disease invariably re-emerges. Initially, CR leads to cell-cycle restriction, apoptosis, and inhibition of TOR and insulin/IGF1 signaling. The relapse, instead, is associated with the non-genetic selection of Leukemia Initiating Cells and the downregulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and Interferon (IFN) signaling genes. The CR-induced adaptive phenotype is highly sensitive to pharmacological or genetic ablation of LSD1, a lysine demethylase regulating both stem cells and dsRNA/ IFN signaling. CR + LSD1 inhibition leads to the re-activation of dsRNA/IFN signaling, massive RNASEL-dependent apoptosis, and complete leukemia eradication in ~90% of mice. Importantly, CR-LSD1 interaction can be modeled in vivo and in vitro by combining LSD1 ablation with pharmacological inhibitors of insulin/IGF1 or dual PI3K/MEK blockade. Mechanistically, insulin/IGF1 inhibition sensitizes blasts to LSD1-induced death by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic factor CFLAR. CR and LSD1 inhibition also synergize in patient-derived AML and triple-negative breast cancer xenografts. Our data provide a rationale for epi-metabolic pharmacologic combinations across multiple tumors.

### Enoyl-CoA hydratase-1 regulates mTOR signaling and apoptosis by sensing nutrients [^115Kz3cX]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Elucidation of nutrients sensory mechanism shed light on understanding the pathologic mechanism of nutrient deregulation-associated disease. In the current study, we provided evidence to support the notion that ECHS1 senses nutrients through K101 acetylation. Overnutrition promotes cancer initiation by providing intracellular conditions that foster transformation of cancer cells. ECHS1 determines the metabolic fates of BCAAs and FAs. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, FAs and BCAAs, the two most important energy reservations for cells, are directed to catabolism to supply energy to the cells, requiring the activity of ECHS1. When nutrients are abundant and the energy supply is sufficient, ECHS1 is effectively inactivated by nutrient-promoted K101 acetylation, which downregulates ECHS1 through synergized effects of ECHS1 inactivation, blockade of ECHS1 mitochondria translocation, and facilitated ECHS1 degradation. BCAAs and FAs are thus directed to the anabolic metabolism to facilitate the generation of anabolic signals mTOR and the formation of membrane, respectively, in cells. This ingenious design ensures the survival of cells under both nutrient-limiting and nutrient-rich conditions. Prolonged inactivation of ECHS1 such as constant exposure to nutrients; however, may result in cancer initiation. Nutrients induce the accumulation of BCAAs in cells and provide cells with anabolic signals (mTOR). Moreover, nutrient abundance results in the accumulation of fatty acids, while facilitating membrane generation in cells, it exerts lipo-toxicity that induces cellular apoptosis. This imposes selection pressures on the cells. Those cells that were resistant to apoptosis for example, cells with higher BCL-2 expression, will be enriched by overnutrition. These two nutrients-induced consequences, if persistent, will increase the number of apoptotic resistant cells, which are then easily transformed to cancer cells (Fig. 10g). Therefore, we propose over-nutrition increases cancer onset by providing selective conditions that allow the survival of cancerous cells. Our model is echoed by our findings that, in cancers such as RCCs, HCCs and colon cancers, which originated from metabolic organs that are exposed to nutrients, ECHS1 is severely downregulated. Furthermore, reports that diabetes and obesity, which are both associated with low levels of ECHS1 but high levels of glucose and/or FAs, increased risk of cancerswhile caloric restriction, a state of low nutrients, delays cancer onset, is consistent with our hypothetical model.

### Science-driven nutritional interventions for the prevention and treatment of cancer [^112sdBXY]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

In population studies, dietary patterns clearly influence the development, progression, and therapeutic response of cancers. Nonetheless, interventional dietary trials have had relatively little impact on the prevention and treatment of malignant disease. Standardization of nutritional interventions combined with high-level mode-of-action studies holds the promise of identifying specific entities and pathways endowed with antineoplastic properties. Here, we critically review the effects of caloric restriction and more specific interventions on macro- and micronutrients in preclinical models as well as in clinical studies. We place special emphasis on the prospect of using defined nutrition-relevant molecules to enhance the efficacy of established anticancer treatments.

Significance

The avoidance of intrinsically hypercaloric and toxic diets contributes to the prevention and cure of cancer. In addition, specific diet-induced molecules such as ketone bodies and micronutrients, including specific vitamins, have drug-like effects that are clearly demonstrable in preclinical models, mostly in the context of immunotherapies. Multiple trials are underway to determine the clinical utility of such molecules.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^115JckmD]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Caloric restriction (CR) is the most effective intervention to reduce the incidence and progression of most spontaneous and induced cancers. Due to the stringency of CR and its associated limitations, including low compliance among study participants and impaired wound healing, alternative dietary interventions are increasingly being considered as viable strategies to combat cancer. These approaches that include modifications of feeding frequency, diet composition, and or length of fasting often recapitulate CR-mediated benefits by conferring cancer protection. Much of the improvement from daily CR is attributed to a sustained reduction in overall caloric intake and periods of prolonged fasting, a frequently overlooked variable that contributes not only to the activation of cellular maintenance and repair pathways, but also to extending health and survival. Most CR regimens utilize a once-a-day feeding protocol which, depending on the level of restriction, can lead to a fasting period of up to 22 h.

### New frontiers in promoting tumour cell death: targeting apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy [^112x46g7]. Oncogene (2012). Low credibility.

Cancer is a multifaceted disease comprising a combination of genetic, metabolic and signalling aberrations, which severely disrupt the normal homeostasis of cell growth and death. Many oncogenic events while promoting tumour development also increase the sensitivity of cells to cell death stimuli including chemotherapeutic drugs. As a result, tumour cells often acquire the ability to evade death by inactivating cell death pathways that normally function to eliminate damaged and harmful cells. The impairment of cell death function is also often the reason for the development of chemotherapeutic resistance encountered during treatment. It is therefore necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of existing cell death pathways and the relevant regulatory components involved, with the intention of identifying new strategies to kill cancer cells. This review provides an insightful overview of the common forms of cell death signalling pathways, the interactions between these pathways and the ways in which these pathways are deregulated in cancer. We also discuss the emerging therapies targeted at activating or restoring cell death pathways to induce tumour cell death, which are currently being tested in clinical trials.

### Caloric restriction mimetics against age-associated disease: targets, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential [^112Gbzmd]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The increase in life expectancy has boosted the incidence of age-related pathologies beyond social and economic sustainability. Consequently, there is an urgent need for interventions that revert or at least prevent the pathogenic age-associated deterioration. The permanent or periodic reduction of calorie intake without malnutrition (caloric restriction and fasting) is the only strategy that reliably extends healthspan in mammals including non-human primates. However, the strict and life-long compliance with these regimens is difficult, which has promoted the emergence of caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs). We define CRMs as compounds that ignite the protective pathways of caloric restriction by promoting autophagy, a cytoplasmic recycling mechanism, via a reduction in protein acetylation. Here, we describe the current knowledge on molecular, cellular, and organismal effects of known and putative CRMs in mice and humans. We anticipate that CRMs will become part of the pharmacological armamentarium against aging and age-related cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and malignant diseases.

### Dietary and pharmacological modification of the insulin / IGF-1 system: exploiting the full repertoire against cancer [^116bL5nF]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

Although inflammation is a powerful driver of tumor growth, it is the aim of this review to focus on the connection between insulin/IGF-1 signaling and cancer, and discuss possibilities to modulate these interactions through DR and pharmaceutical interventions to improve cancer outcomes. We here refer to DR as any intervention that either restricts the total amount of energy consumed without changing the macronutrient ratio (calorie restriction; CR) or restricts a particular macronutrient without necessarily lowering the energy content of the diet. Usually, CR involves a 20–50% reduction in energy intake while maintaining sufficient intake of essential vitamins and minerals. It can be achieved via chronic energy restriction, the most extreme form of which is short-term starvation (STS, corresponding to water-only fasting) or intermittend fasting (IF) regimes such as only eating every other day.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^116Q8UDS]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

scLICs showed properties of a metabolically quiescent phenotype, previously associated with dormant HSCs, including decreased expression of OXPHOS, MYC, proliferation, and Interferon alpha/gamma gene sets, maintained in all treatment groups (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 6g). scLIC cells also exhibited coexisting low-intermediate levels of the transcription factors Irf8 and Gfi1 (Fig. 4i), which in normal bone marrow identify a rare, phenotypically unstable progenitor population that rapidly commits to either Gfi1 high /Irf8 - granulocytes or Gfi1 - /Irf8 high monocytes. Upon LSD1i, however, most cells, including scLICs, upregulated Irf8 expression (Supplementary Fig. 6h), as observed in bulk RNAseq data, and became Gfi1 high / Irf8 high, a bi-differentiated cell state presumably not compatible with cell survival (Fig. 4i). Notably, Irf8 was recently identified as a key factor for the development of PML-RAR expressing AMLs (APLs)and sensitizes myeloid cells to extrinsic, TNF/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Consistently, a signature predictive of TRAIL sensitivitywas significantly upregulated upon LSD1i treatment (Fig. 4j). Thus, LSD1 inhibition, through the activation of an interferon-associated transcriptional program, induces a phenotypically unstable and apoptosis-prone state in APL cells, including LSCs.

### Dietary modifications for enhanced cancer therapy [^115VN6MX]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Tumours depend on nutrients supplied by the host for their growth and survival. Modifications to the host's diet can change nutrient availability in the tumour microenvironment, which might represent a promising strategy for inhibiting tumour growth. Dietary modifications can limit tumour-specific nutritional requirements, alter certain nutrients that target the metabolic vulnerabilities of the tumour, or enhance the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs. Recent reports have suggested that modification of several nutrients in the diet can alter the efficacy of cancer therapies, and some of the newest developments in this quickly expanding field are reviewed here. The results discussed indicate that the dietary habits and nutritional state of a patient must be taken into account during cancer research and therapy.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^112ecKxQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Study limitations

The main goal of the present study was to address the impact of calories, diet composition, and daily CR vs. LCC on tumorigenesis. Our follow-up work will evaluate how combining different diet compositions with standard therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment (e.g. chemotherapy) can influence tumor growth and metastases. The current findings are limited to a single tumor model (4T1 murine metastatic breast cancer). Therefore, additional work will be necessary to determine if similar outcomes occur in other types of tumors. It will also be important to evaluate whether caloric cycling can recapitulate the beneficial effects of daily CR on different cancer types, stages, and spontaneous tumor development in animals of both sexes.

### The mitochondrial anti-apoptotic dependencies of hematologic malignancies: from disease biology to advances in precision medicine [^111W4sTh]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevention of programmed cell death is a hallmark of cancer cells and efforts to re-establish pro-death pathways have been the mainstay of research in the field of anti-cancer therapeutics. Among modalities of programmed cell death, apoptosis is the best characterized in terms of triggering stimuli, sequencing of biochemical events, intracellular organelles involved, and morphological changes. Two interconnected forms of apoptosis have been described: the extrinsic and the intrinsic (i.e. mitochondrial) pathways. The former is triggered on the cell surface by the engagement of death receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor, and proceeds through caspase-8/10 activation and BID cleavage. The latter is induced by oncogenic signaling, nutrient deprivation, genotoxic drugs and other cellular stressors, and is regulated at the level of the outer mitochondrial membrane by pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members.

### Do cancer and cancer treatments accelerate aging? [^116hRfCM]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The Role of Diet

Animal models suggest that caloric restriction can slow biological aging and can not only delay the onset of cancer but also can delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders and prolong overall lifespan. Furthermore, during the last decades, diet and nutrition have been implicated in cancer risk, progression, and treatment response through acting on shared aging pathways described above including telomerase activity, bioenergetics, DNA repair, and oxidative stress. To illustrate, it is estimated that 30–40% of cancers can be prevented by lifestyle choices including a healthy diet, improved physical activity, and prevention of obesity and overweight. Studies of immigrants suggest that migration is associated with altered cancer risk compared to the country of origin. For example, first-generation Japanese women in the USA have a threefold increase in breast cancer compared to women living in Japan. Similarly, studies of European migrants to Australia showed a higher risk of colorectal cancer (similar to Australian-born population) but a diminished risk of stomach cancer (similar to Australian-born population), proportional to the migrants' duration in the country. It is thought that these alterations in cancer risk are at least partially due to dietary acculturation.

Furthermore, calorie restriction (CR), or reduction in dietary intake by 30% without causing malnutrition, has been postulated to curb excess adiposity and thus decrease the level of oxidative stress that promotes tumorigenesis. In vitro studies suggest that CR can not only halt tumor progression but also increase lifespan in experimental animal models. In a prostate cancer mouse model, calorie restriction decreased tumor weight and plasma insulin levels as well as decreased IGF-1 signaling which was correlated with higher apoptosis levels. In human studies, 15% caloric reduction over 4 years showed a decrease in the growth factors cascade associated with increased risk of cancer. Another study of calorie restriction over a 2-year period in humans demonstrated a reduction in markers of oxidative stress associated with tumorigenesis.

Thus, diet and nutrition can alter both cancer and aging outcomes. Yet simply recommending dieting and/or fasting can be challenging in patients with malignancies due to the occurrence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity associated with both cancer and its treatment. Additionally, the relationship between diet, nutrition, aging, and the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment is not well understood.

### When less may be more: calorie restriction and response to cancer therapy [^116eBjoJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan and has been shown to reduce age-related diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in experimental models. Recent translational studies have tested the potential of CR or CR mimetics as adjuvant therapies to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and novel immunotherapies. Chronic CR is challenging to employ in cancer patients, and therefore intermittent fasting, CR mimetic drugs, or alternative diets (such as a ketogenic diet), may be more suitable. Intermittent fasting has been shown to enhance treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. CR and fasting elicit different responses in normal and cancer cells, and reduce certain side effects of cytotoxic therapy. Findings from preclinical studies of CR mimetic drugs and other dietary interventions, such as the ketogenic diet, are promising for improving the efficacy of anticancer therapies and reducing the side effects of cytotoxic treatments. Current and future clinical studies will inform on which cancers, and at which stage of the cancer process, CR, fasting, or CR mimetic regimens will prove most effective.

### Sirtuin functions and modulation: from chemistry to the clinic [^117JMW1m]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases regulating important metabolic pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are involved in many biological processes such as cell survival, senescence, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, cell metabolism, and caloric restriction. The seven members of this family of enzymes are considered potential targets for the treatment of human pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Furthermore, recent interest focusing on sirtuin modulators as epigenetic players in the regulation of fundamental biological pathways has prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules able to modify sirtuin activity. Here, we review the role, mechanism of action, and biological function of the seven sirtuins, as well as their inhibitors and activators.

### Cancer-specific functions of SIRT1 enable human epithelial cancer cell growth and survival [^114DDFwx]. Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

SIRT1 is a conserved NAD-dependent deacetylase that regulates life span in accord with nutritional provision. In mammalian cells, SIRT1 also down-regulates stress-induced p53 and FoxO pathways for apoptosis, thus favoring survival under stress. The functioning of SIRT1 under normal, nonstressed conditions of cell growth is unknown. Here we have asked if SIRT1 has the capacity to influence cell viability in the absence of applied stress. For this purpose we used synthetic small interfering RNA to silence SIRT1 gene expression by RNA interference (RNAi). We show that the process of RNAi, by itself, does not affect cell growth and is not sufficient to activate a cellular stress response (indicated by lack of activation of endogenous p53). We also show that, in the absence of applied stress, SIRT1 silencing induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis in human epithelial cancer cells. In contrast, normal human epithelial cells and normal human diploid fibroblasts seem to be refractory to SIRT1 silencing. Combined gene knockout with RNAi cosilencing experiments indicate that SIRT1 and Bcl-2 may suppress separable apoptotic pathways in the same cell lineage and that the SIRT1-regulated pathway is independent of p53, Bax, and caspase-2. Alternatively, SIRT1 may suppress apoptosis downstream from these apoptotic factors. In either case, we show that FoxO4 (but not FoxO3) is required as proapoptotic mediator. We further identify caspase-3 and caspase-7 as downstream executioners of SIRT1/FoxO4-regulated apoptosis. Our work identifies SIRT1 as a novel target for selective killing of cancer versus noncancer epithelial cells.

### Enoyl-CoA hydratase-1 regulates mTOR signaling and apoptosis by sensing nutrients [^113q4nri]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Overnutrition has become a major health care challenge given that it increases the risks for a number of major human diseases. For example, epidemiological studies indicate that overnutrition is linked to increased risks of various cancers. However, the mechanisms involved in the promotion of cancer onset by nutrients remain poorly understood. The increase in insulin induced by nutrients is hypothesized to be a cause of cancers, given that human cancers produce/secrete insulin or depend on insulin. Moreover, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalingby nutrients, the master regulator of anabolic metabolism, is also proposed as a cause of overnutrition-associated cancers because mTOR signaling is commonly activated in cancer cells. However, the activation of mTOR signaling in cancer cells is often due to mutations in oncogenes, such as in PI3K, Ras, and Raf, growth factor receptor kinases, autocrine growth factors –, and tumor suppressors such as PTEN, AMPK, TSC2, LKB1, and NF1. There is insufficient direct evidence that overnutrition is directly associated with an increase of such mutations. Moreover, nutrient-promoted insulin secretion and mTOR activation are temporary and reversible processes that are relieved by nutrient removal, indicating that overnutrition does not promote cancer onset through promoting mutations. Creation of environments that facilitate the survival of cells with cancerous mutations is another possible mechanism for nutrients to induce cancer. However, overnutrition such as high glucose promotes apoptosis in endothelial cells, β-cells and in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, showing that alternative mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic effects of overnutrition.

### Inhibition of malic enzyme 1 disrupts cellular metabolism and leads to vulnerability in cancer cells in glucose-restricted conditions [^114gfjyT]. Oncogenesis (2017). Low credibility.

Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) regulates one of the main pathways that provide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is essential for cancer cell growth through maintenance of redox balance and biosynthesis processes in the cytoplasm. In this study, we found that ME1 inhibition disrupted metabolism in cancer cells and inhibited cancer cell growth by inducing senescence or apoptosis. In glucose-restricted culture conditions, cancer cells increased ME1 expression, and tracer experiments with labelled glutamine revealed that the flux of ME1-derived pyruvate to citrate was enhanced. In addition, cancer cells showed higher sensitivity to ME1 depletion in glucose-restricted conditions compared to normal culture conditions. These results suggest that in a low-glucose environment, where glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is attenuated, cancer cells become dependent on ME1 for the supply of NADPH and pyruvate. Our data demonstrate that ME1 is a promising target for cancer treatment, and a strategy using ME1 inhibitors combined with inhibition of glycolysis, PPP or redox balance regulators may provide an effective therapeutic option.

### Clinical research framework proposal for ketogenic metabolic therapy in glioblastoma [^115rVso4]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Calorically restricted KD (KD-R): reaching GKI targets while preserving muscle mass

The classic KD was originally intended to be eucaloric or unrestricted ("ad libitum") to allow for the appropriate maturation of pediatric patients with epilepsy, and while therapeutic benefits have been reported in preclinical cancer models in both unrestricted and calorically restricted amounts, most clinical studies focused on eucaloric feeding to promote weight maintenance. A failure to reduce proliferation could be a consequence of persistently elevated glucose availability, endocrine, or growth-promoting signaling due to energy surplus, despite shifting to a ketogenic state.

In contrast, KDs consumed in calorically restricted amounts, resulting in a gradual, deliberate reduction of fat mass (with preserved muscle mass), could produce better cumulative, steady-state GKI values, in tandem with the underlying metabolic and signaling effects, such as insulin suppression. Calorie restriction (independent of macronutrient composition) increases metabolic pressure on tumor cells by modulating nutrient-sensing pathways. Similarly, reduced energy intake makes it easier to adapt to the higher overall fat intake despite enhanced satiety.

The CR-induced adaptive phenotype is highly sensitive to pharmacological or genetic ablation of LSD1, a lysine demethylase regulating both stem cells and dsRNA/ IFN signaling. CR+LSD1 inhibition leads to the re-activation of dsRNA/IFN signaling, massive RNASEL-dependent apoptosis, and complete leukemia eradication in ~90% of mice. Importantly, CR-LSD1 interaction can be modeled in vivo and in vitro by combining LSD1 ablation with pharmacological inhibitors of insulin/IGF1 or dual PI3K/MEK blockade. Mechanistically, insulin/IGF1 inhibition sensitizes blasts to LSD1-induced death by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic factor CFLAR. CR and LSD1 inhibition also synergize in patient-derived AML and triple-negative breast cancer xenografts. Our data provide a rationale for epi-metabolic pharmacologic combinations across multiple tumors.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^113AuJVN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

CFLAR down-regulation likely occurs due to a generalized reduction in transcription and translation rate associated with lower insulin signaling, which disproportionately affects CFLAR, a high turnover protein upregulated de novo upon apoptotic stimuli. Indeed, Insulin/IGF1 blockade led, as expected, to significant decrease in de novo overall translation (Supplementary Fig. 8f). Direct inhibition of translation or transcription using non-lethal doses of actinomycin D or cycloheximide led to similar reduction in baseline and TRAIL-induced CFLAR (Supplementary Fig. 8g) and to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LSD1-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 8h, i).

To confirm the role CFLAR in OSI-906 - dependent apoptosis, we overexpressed CFLARs in NB4 and LSDKO cells (Supplementary Fig. 8j). Importantly, transgenic CFLAR levels were not affected by OSI-906 (Supplementary Fig. 8k). Overexpression of CFLARs led to generally increased survival, but most importantly completely abrogated TRAIL-induced death in OSI-906-treated LSD1-KO cells, as shown by both PI/annexin V and cleaved caspase-3 quantification (Fig. 5k, l and Supplementary Fig. 8l). These results demonstrate that sensitization of OSI-906 treatment to the apoptotic effect of LSD1 inhibition is due to the OSI-906 - dependent down-regulation of CFLAR expression.

### Nutrient restriction and radiation therapy for cancer treatment: when less is more [^112W4kMG]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Calorie restriction (CR), or a diet modification aiming to reduce the total intake of calories by 20%-40%, has been shown to increase longevity across multiple species. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the potential role of CR as a treatment intervention for age-related diseases, such as cancer, because an increasing body of literature has demonstrated a metabolic component to both carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In fact, many of the molecular pathways that are altered with CR are also known to be altered in cancer. Therefore, manipulation of these pathways using CR can render cancer cells, and most notably breast cancer cells, more susceptible to standard cytotoxic treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. In this review article we demonstrate the laboratory and clinical evidence that exists for CR and show compelling evidence through the molecular pathways CR induces about how it may be used as a treatment in tandem with radiation therapy to improve our rates of disease control.

### Clinical outcomes, mechanisms, and moderators-NCI… [^115MEko7]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

United States Alabama Birmingham University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center Combining fasting with chemotherapy is known to cause complete tumor regression and long-term survival in animal models. According to the Differential Stress Sensitization theory, acute fasting sensitizes tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation, while protecting healthy cells by increasing stress. resistance. These effects are believed to be largely mediated via the Insulin-like Growth Factor pathway. However, extended fasting can be challenging for patients and poses undue health risks. A number of alternative intermittent fasting regimens have been proposed to overcome the challenges of prolonged caloric restriction. One promising. approach is time-restricted eating, which involves eating within a period of 10 hours or less, followed by fasting for at least 14 hours daily.

TRE does not involve extended caloric restriction, and because of its simplicity, it may be more sustainable than other fasting regimens. TRE improves several cardiometabolic endpoints independent. of calorie restriction in both animals and humans, including insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, fat oxidation, and hunger. Our team's pilot and feasibility trials suggest that TRE may also have anti-cancer effects: it decreases IGF-1 levels, reduces oxidative stress, upregulates antioxidant defenses, and enhances autophagy. Moreover, our data. suggest TRE is sustainable, as participants were adherent 6. 0 plus or minus
0. 8 days/week over a 14-week period. These findings lead to the following provocative question: Can TRE reduce treatment-related toxicity, induce tumor regression, and improve both patient-reported and clinical outcomes. We propose to conduct the largest randomized. controlled trial of any form of intermittent fasting in patients undergoing cancer treatment.

We focus on patients with localized rectal or breast cancer because it is one of the few treatment paradigms in which tumor characteristics can be measured before and after chemoradiation therapy.

### Energy and caloric restriction, and fasting and cancer: a narrative review [^116nqWWX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As nutrition and metabolism are essential for human physiology, it is not surprising that dietary interventions attract attention as a safe means to limit tumor progression or reinstate disease control by the host immune system. While preclinical studies support the concept that reducing total calorie intake may stimulate anticancer immunity, evidence-driven from earlier clinical studies lack enough power to draw definite conclusions. Multiple trials evaluating these possibilities in patients with distinct types of cancer are ongoing. De Groot et al. and Castejón et al. reported on comprehensive lists of ongoing studies of dietary interventions. Such interventions include CR, intermediate fasting, ketogenic and low carbohydrate diets, and restrictive protein diets for patients with several advanced cancer types. Several trials are designed to investigate the combination of dietary restriction in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, or metformin to ameliorate side effects, improve quality of life, or improve outcome. Other trials aimed at assessing the preventive role of CR on age-related chronic diseases, including cancer such as the CALERIE trial.

Dietary intervention trials have inherent challenges to overcome. First, dietary interventions are quite heterogeneous. Second, the studies' control arms usually receive advice in relation to healthy nutritional habits. Third, compliance with the tested dietary intervention is hard to be enforced and difficult to be monitored. Nevertheless, future research will hopefully inform and firmly establish the potential efficacy and safety of these dietary interventions.

### Envirotune-CAR-T: a hypoxia-responsive and glutamine-enhanced CAR-T cell therapy for overcoming tumor microenvironment-mediated suppression [^115hQu3K]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, achieving unprecedented clinical responses in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. However, its efficacy in solid tumors remains constrained by the dual challenges of immunosuppressive signals and metabolic dysregulation within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Solid tumors establish a pathophysiological niche characterized by fluctuating hypoxia gradients, nutrient deprivation, and aberrant metabolite accumulation conditions that collectively impair T cell receptor signaling, mitochondrial fitness, and epigenetic programming, ultimately subverting CAR-T cell infiltration, persistence, and effector functions. Among these barriers, hypoxia emerges as a master regulator that not only stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α/2α) to drive immunosuppressive angiogenesis but also rewires cellular metabolism through transcriptional repression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Hypoxic stress imposes a tripartite liability: it cripples mitochondrial respiration by destabilizing electron transport chain complexes, restricts clonal expansion through mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling dampening, and directly induces T cell exhaustion via sustained programmed death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis activation-mechanistic cascades that collectively erode therapeutic efficacy. Hypoxic stress triggers a conserved transcriptional program mediated by HIF-1α binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs), upregulating genes critical for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Erythropoietin (EPO), and metabolic adaptation (lactate dehydrogenase A, Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI)). This oxygen-sensing pathway has been strategically leveraged in CAR-T design, with HRE-driven constructs demonstrating enhanced targeting of solid tumor antigens including ErbB2/Her2 in hypoxic niches.

The metabolic battlefield within the TME imposes an additional layer of complexity. Tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells engage in fierce competition for glucose, amino acids, and other critical metabolites. Glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid, serves as a nodal point in this conflict — it fuels the tricarboxylic acid cycle for energy production, supports redox homeostasis through glutathione synthesis, and provides nitrogen groups for nucleotide biosynthesis. Recent studies reveal that glutamine scarcity in the TME correlates with impaired CAR-T cell expansion and accelerated exhaustion phenotypes, suggesting that enhancing glutamine utilization capacity could break this metabolic stalemate. Notably, solute carrier family 38 member 2 (SLC38A2), a high-affinity glutamine transporter upregulated in activated T cells, may serve as a gatekeeper for glutamine-dependent metabolic reprogramming. Its expression dynamics under hypoxic stress, however, remain unexplored.

### Harnessing the Co-vulnerabilities of amino acid-restricted cancers [^1111FHcr]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Sustained proliferative potential of cancer cells creates heightened energetic and biosynthetic demands. The resulting overt dependence of cancer cells on unperturbed nutrient supply has prompted a widespread interest in amino acid restriction strategies as potential cancer therapeutics. However, owing to rapid signaling and metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, the prospects for success of amino acid restriction approaches remain unclear. We thus recognize that the identification of co-vulnerabilities of amino acid-restricted cancers may inform actionable targets for effective combined interventions. In this perspective, we outline the current state of key cellular mechanisms underlying adaptation to amino acid restriction and discuss the role of signal transduction pathways governing cancer cell resistance to amino acid restriction, with potential ramifications for the design of future therapeutic efforts.

### Nutrition in cancer: evidence and equality [^111Ey14P]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, and 30% to 40% of cancers are estimated to be preventable by a healthy diet, adequate physical activity, and maintaining a normal body habitus. According to recent estimates, 80,000 cancer cases per year could be prevented with an adequate diet alone. The importance of nutrition is broadly implicated in cancer incidence, outcomes, and mitigation of long-term comorbidities after treatment. Unfortunately, nutrition recommendations in oncology remain vague and often contradictory. Epidemiologic studies throughout the 20th and 21st centuries associate high-calorie diets and obesity with the incidence of many types of cancer. Indeed, morbidities of obesity, including insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2, are both independently recognized to increase cancer risk.

Initial intervention studies illustrating the link between tumor growth and caloric intake span back to the early 1900s. Mechanistically, studies have revealed that the chronic consumption of excess calories promotes an increase in the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is paramount to nutrient sensing and subsequent cell growth. Various methods of dietary interventions to mitigate this pathway are under active exploration, including caloric restriction, intermittent-fasting, and specific macronutrient restriction.

### Why target apoptosis in cancer treatment? [^1111kEDU]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Defective apoptosis (programmed cell death) represents a major causative factor in the development and progression of cancer. The ability of tumor cells to evade engagement of apoptosis can play a significant role in their resistance to conventional therapeutic regimens. Our understanding of the complexities of apoptosis and the mechanisms evolved by tumor cells to resist engagement of cell death has focused research effort into the development of strategies designed to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. This article will review the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis and the ways in which tumor cells modulate these processes to promote their survival and evaluate the efficacy of current clinical approaches aimed at exploiting these defects to selectively induce apoptosis in tumor cells.

### Autophagy as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer [^1179MrGq]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

PDAC is associated with increased metabolism and autophagy

Pancreatic tumours, at least at their primary site (as opposed to metastases), are hypoxic and nutrient-poor, which might explain the high level of basal autophagy in these tumours. Furthermore, the activation of oncogenes, which often leads to increased proliferation, leads to an increase in tumour metabolism. This might be one of the reasons that autophagy is important for sustaining the survival and proliferation of KRAS-mutant tumours. This is exemplified in studies conducted in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS-mutant lung tumours, in which genetic ablation of autophagy leads to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower energy levels, and a fall in the levels of nucleotide pools during starvation. In this model, therefore, autophagy sustains tumour metabolism by preventing fatal nucleotide depletion and energy crisis during starvation. In PDAC cell lines, inhibition of autophagy leads to a decreased oxygen consumption rate, potentially indicating decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Viale et al.have shown in an inducible model of KRAS signalling that resistance to KRAS-targeting therapy might be driven by a subpopulation of tumour cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation for survival instead of the classic Warburg effect. Oxidative phosphorylation is highly dependent on mitochondrial respiration, and genes implicated in this phenomenon, as well as autophagy- and lysosome-related genes, were upregulated in surviving cells. As previously discussed, Perera et al. uncovered that, in these cells, the induction of autophagy is only one part of a broader transcriptional programme destined to supply tumour cells with adequate quantities of nutrients.

Altogether, these data show that autophagy has a role in maintaining sufficient supplies of energy and nutrient to tumours via tumour-cell-autonomous, stromal and systemic autophagy. Combining inhibition of tumour autophagy and systemic caloric restriction to starve cancer cells has proved efficient in nude mice with kidney tumours but seems quite intriguing from a conceptual stand point because caloric restriction is known to lead to activation of systemic autophagy. In this sense, these results suggest that activation of systemic autophagy combined with inhibition of autophagy in tumours is more efficient than each of them separately. A possible explanation could be that caloric restriction causes a dependency on autophagy (which is higher in cancer cells given their high metabolic rate). Accordingly, this dependency would render cancer cells sensitive to autophagy inhibitors, explaining the observed effect.

### Mitochondrial impairment in the five-sixth nephrectomy model of chronic renal failure: proteomic approach [^113qeStW]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Autophagy has been linked with negative regulation of apoptosis. The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is mediated by complex interactions between Bcl-2 proteins. Two members of this family, BH3-only proteins Beclin 1 and BNIP3, were up-regulated in the PNx kidneys (Figure 4). The role of Beclin 1, an important inducer of autophagosome membrane formation, in regulation of apoptosis is not fully understood. Expression of the BNIP3 protein is specifically up-regulated by hypoxia. BNIP3 is primarily localized in the mitochondrial membrane but has also recently been found on the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress condition BNIP3 binds directly to LC3-II through its LC3-interacting region thus delivering target damaged organelles for autophagic degradation. In hypoxic aged kidneys, BNIP3 activation by caloric restriction promotes mitochondrial autophagy and thus enhances kidney adaptation to hypoxia. However, BNIP3 functions are context-dependent and autophagy induction and cell-death promotion are shown to be two separate activities of BNIP3. As we found in PNx kidneys, autophagy is not likely to be up-regulated, thus BNIP3 autophagic activities may be limited (Figure 4). When autophagy is inhibited, BNIP3 induces swelling of inner mitochondrial membranes and triggers release of pro-apoptotic proteins. Notably, a drastic increase in apoptosis of tubular epithelial begins from 4 weeks after surgery in the PNx models. In addition to apoptosis and autophagy, mitochondria-bound BNIP3 forms a complex with NIX and Mieap proteins, which mediates translocation of lysosomal proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. Through such a mechanism BNIP3 controls elimination of oxidized mitochondrial proteins as shown in cancerous cells. Our finding of down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins located in the inner mitochondrial compartments (Figure 2 A) suggests that this particular mechanism may be activated by BNIP3 in PNx kidneys. BNIP3 protein involvement in mitochondrial turnover and cell death has been mostly studied in the myocardium and in multiple cancer cell lines. We have recently demonstrated that renal necrosis in the Goldblatt's 2 kidneys, 1 clip model was associated with up-regulation and activation of BNIP3 protein. Specifically, reduction of oxidative stress by activation of PPARδ signaling resulted in BNIP3 deactivation, preservation of mitochondrial function, and prevention of cell death.

### Identification of the apoptosis activation cascade induced in mammary carcinomas by energy restriction [^11276vAR]. Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Energy restriction (ER) inhibits mammary carcinogenesis and results in a marked reduction in tumor size, effects likely to be explained by ER-mediated induction of apoptosis. The goal of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) accounting for apoptosis induction. To do this, chemically induced mammary carcinomas were evaluated from rats that were ad libitum fed (control), 40% ER, or 40% ER but energy repleted for 7 days before study termination (ER-REP); the ER-REP group permitted the determination of the reversibility of ER-mediated effects. Cleaved products of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 were elevated by ER (P < 0.025) providing biochemical evidence of apoptosis induction. cDNA microarray analysis identified the Bcl-2, CARD, and IAP functional gene groupings as being involved in apoptosis induction. Consistent with the microarray data, the activities of caspases 9 and 3 were observed to be approximately 2-fold higher in carcinomas from ER rats (P ≤ 0.01), whereas caspase 8 activity was similar in carcinomas from all three of the groups. This evidence that ER-induced apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway was additionally supported by the finding that levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and XIAP protein were significantly lower (P < 0.01), and levels of Bax and Apaf-1 were elevated (P < 0.02) in ER carcinomas versus those carcinomas from control or ER-REP rats. Additional studies revealed that Akt phosphorylation (activation) was reduced in mammary carcinomas from ER rats. Thus, it appears that ER induces apoptosis in mammary carcinomas via a cell survival factor-dependent pathway.

### Nutrition in cancer: evidence and equality [^116Sz8PT]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the beneficial mechanistic changes that accompany caloric restriction, long-term calorie restriction is likely not feasible in the oncology clinic. Many studies show that patients who lose significant weight during cancer treatment have poorer outcomes and a reduced quality of life. These effects are multifactorial. The development of cachexia, defined as skeletal muscle loss with or without anorexia and not reversible with nutritional intervention, portends a poor prognosis. Cachexia is poorly understood, likely resulting from a mixture of systemic inflammation, increased resting energy expenditure, and decreased protein synthesis. Therefore, the potential benefits of caloric restriction while preventing the incidence of cachexia are difficult to glean. In addition, long-term caloric restriction was shown to decrease immune function in animal models.

Given these challenges, time-restricted feeding, which includes short-term fasting, intermittent fasting, and short-term extreme caloric restriction, have been studied. Cellular adaptions to starvation, conserved from yeast to mammals, repeatedly show increases in stress resistance by reducing nutrients and growth signals, such as IGF-1, and thus downregulating the PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathway. Reductions in IGF-1 signaling have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest as normal cells partition cellular processes toward survival while tumor cells are largely immune to this regulation. This difference, termed differential stress resistance, allows normal but not tumor cell survival in response to high doses of chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed, short-term fasting in just 48 to 72 hours induced a 70% reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels and protected mice to lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents. Cycles of fasting proved effective at delaying cancer progression in multiple tumor mouse models, reducing toxicities to chemotherapy and promoting long-term survival, particularly when combined with chemotherapy. In humans, short-term fasts have been shown to be safe and may decrease chemotherapeutic side effects. Additional studies are ongoing and promising.

### Cancer's sweet tooth: the Janus effect of glucose metabolism in tumorigenesis [^115qM1Y5]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Despite Otto Warburg's 1931 Nobel Prize for his work affirming the role of metabolism in carcinogenesis, there has been little further interest in this association between metabolism and cancer. Disinterest has, in part, been attributable to the notion that Warburg's description of a relation between a shift to glycolysis in carcinogenesis may be an epiphenomenon rather than a mechanistic determinant. By studying the critical cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), I postulate that the association between intermediary metabolism and tumours varies over time. Through accumulation of carbohydrates and pan-inhibition of AMPK, premalignant tumours may gain a replicative advantage through the repression of senescence. Conversely, malignant tumours, with a defective tumour suppressor contingent, undergo a "glycolytic switch", in part by tolerating a degree of AMPK activation, to mitigate substrate limitation. I contend that this Janus-faced relation with intermediary metabolism contributes to carcinogenesis; if proven, this finding would have important implications for public health, in that it would lend support to the idea that prevention of obesity, and caloric restriction and exercise could reduce the predisposition to cancer.

### Caloric restriction mimetics enhance anticancer immunosurveillance [^111AZz2L]. Cancer Cell (2016). Low credibility.

Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) mimic the biochemical effects of nutrient deprivation by reducing lysine acetylation of cellular proteins, thus triggering autophagy. Treatment with the CRM hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase, induced the depletion of regulatory T cells (which dampen anticancer immunity) from autophagy-competent, but not autophagy-deficient, mutant KRAS-induced lung cancers in mice, thereby improving anticancer immunosurveillance and reducing tumor mass. Short-term fasting or treatment with several chemically unrelated autophagy-inducing CRMs, including hydroxycitrate and spermidine, improved the inhibition of tumor growth by chemotherapy in vivo. This effect was only observed for autophagy-competent tumors, depended on the presence of T lymphocytes, and was accompanied by the depletion of regulatory T cells from the tumor bed.

### MTORC1 inhibition in cancer cells protects from glutaminolysis-mediated apoptosis during nutrient limitation [^116uNknQ]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Although it is known that glutaminolysis is a source to replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle and also activates mTORC1, the capacity of glutaminolysis to sustain mTORC1 activation and cell growth in the long term in the absence of other nitrogen sources has not been elucidated. Here we report that, surprisingly, the long-term activation of glutaminolysis in the absence of other amino acids induces the aberrant inhibition of autophagy in an mTORC1-dependent manner. This inhibition of autophagy during amino acid restriction led to apoptotic cell death due to the accumulation of the autophagic protein p62 and the subsequent activation of caspase 8. Of note, the inhibition of mTORC1 restores autophagy and blocks the apoptosis induced by glutaminolysis activation. Our results highlight the tumour suppressor features of mTORC1 during nutrient restriction and provide with an alternative explanation for the poor outcome obtained using mTORC1 inhibitors as an anticancer therapy.

### Nutrition in cancer: evidence and equality [^115FhhU4]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

More recent studies in the 1990s to early 2000s replicated the findings of CR in the reduction of incidence and growth of cancer. Decreased growth was found in additional rodent models of glioma, prostate, colon, and mammary cancers. One recent study in primates randomized 72 rhesus monkeys to 30% caloric restriction versus standard feed and found a significant reduction in the onset of age-related diseases, including a 50% reduction in the lifetime development of cancer. However, the mechanism for tumor inhibition remains poorly understood. In a glioma model, 40% CR significantly decreased vascularity and increased apoptosis within the tumor and significantly decreased intracerebral growth. These effects were accompanied by systemic reductions in both IGF-1 and glucose.CR also reduced the growth of prostate cancer accompanied by reduced levels of IGF-1. IGF-1 appears to mediate this mechanism, at least in part by decreasing proto-oncogene signaling downstream of PI3k. Indeed, Sabatini et al. found that multiple cancer cell lines grown in mice are highly sensitive to CR and become resistant only with a gain of function PI3k mutations. However, of note, all animal studies suffer from potential bias because experimental mice are generally overweight and medically morbid; thus, questioning whether the dietary mechanisms are providing profound antitumor effects or merely offsetting the resulting sequalae from a previous overfed state.

### Mechanisms of energy restriction: effects of corticosterone on cell growth, cell cycle machinery, and apoptosis [^114zRwF8]. Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

The restriction of energy intake has documented beneficial effects on numerous diseases including cancer, yet the mechanism(s) that accounts for these effects is unknown. Recently, we showed that the inhibitory activity against mammary carcinogenesis mediated by energy restriction (ER) is accompanied by an increase in the secretion of adrenal cortical steroids. However, ER caused a concomitant reduction in circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, which also may be involved in inhibiting carcinogenesis. To determine what cellular and molecular effects may be because of corticosterone per se, detailed mechanistic studies were performed in vitro using a mouse mammary hyperplastic cell line (TM10). The following questions were addressed: (a) is corticosterone-mediated growth inhibition accounted for by disruption of cell cycle machinery; (b) is growth inhibition accompanied by the induction of apoptosis; and (c) is growth inhibition reversible? At doses of corticosterone (50–200 micro M for 24–72 h) that resulted in inhibition (up to 76%; P < 0.001) of growth, a dose- and time-dependent G(1) arrest in cell cycle progression was observed. In the studies analyzing cell cycle regulatory molecules, corticosterone treatment of cells resulted in a strong induction (up to approximately 10-fold over control; P < 0.01) of KIP1/P27 together with a decrease (up to 98%; P < 0.01) in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1 protein levels. Cells treated with corticosterone also showed an increased binding (up to 2.6-fold over control; P < 0.01) of KIP1/P27 with CDK4, together with a strong decrease (up to 89%; P < 0.01) in the kinase activity of the CDK4-cyclin D1 complex. Treatment of cells with KIP1/P27 antisense oligonucleotides reversed the growth inhibitory effects of corticosterone. Treatment of cells with RU 486, a glucocorticoid receptor blocker, reversed the effects of corticosterone on cell growth and KIP/P27 protein levels suggesting the involvement of the glucocorticoid receptor in accounting for these effects. Additional studies assessing the biological fate of cells after corticosterone treatment showed that corticosterone exerted reversible growth inhibitory effects with limited apoptotic cell death. Together, these findings show a reversible cytostatic effect of corticosterone via perturbations in cell cycle regulators causing a G(1) arrest in the absence of increased levels of apoptosis. These data provide evidence for a role of corticosterone on some but not all of the cellular activities associated with ER-mediated inhibition of mammary carcinogenesis.

### Caloric restriction leads to druggable LSD1-dependent cancer stem cells expansion [^112MQQH5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

CR led to a significant delay in blast accumulation in the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and spleen (Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Fig. 1f–i). CR blasts were less proliferative (by Ki67 and DAPI; Fig. 1e) and showed a modest trend for higher apoptosis (by cleaved caspase-3 positive) (Supplementary Fig. 1j–l). These anti-tumor effects confirm previous reports of CR in various tumor-types –. However, leukemia ultimately developed in all CR mice, which at 6 weeks (when CR mice showed no clinical signs of disease, while ~1/3 of the SD mice were already dead) showed levels of blast infiltration in the BM and spleen comparable to SD mice (Fig. 1c, d). Notably, blast re-expansion was observed in all CR-treated mice, which eventually succumbed to the disease (Fig. 1a). Thus, CR induces a transient anti-leukemic response, which is invariably followed by lethal blast-expansion.

### Phase II prospective randomized trial of weight loss prior to radical prostatectomy [^113MbdQy]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is associated with poorly differentiated and advanced prostate cancer and increased mortality. In preclinical models, caloric restriction delays prostate cancer progression and prolongs survival. We sought to determine if weight loss (WL) in men with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy affects tumor apoptosis and proliferation, and if WL effects other metabolic biomarkers.

Methods

In this Phase II prospective trial, overweight and obese men scheduled for radical prostatectomy were randomized to a 5–8 week WL program consisting of standard structured energy-restricted meal plans (1200–1500Kcal/day) and physical activity or to a control group. The primary endpoint was apoptotic index in the radical prostatectomy malignant epithelium. Secondary endpoints were proliferation (Ki67) in the radical prostatectomy tissue, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio, body composition, and serum PSA, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, testosterone, estradiol, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, insulin-like growth factor 1, and IGF binding protein 1.

Results

In total 23 patients were randomized to the WL intervention and 21 patients to the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly more weight loss (WL:-3.7 ± 0.5kg; Control:-1.6 ± 0.5kg; p = 0.007) than the control group and total fat mass was significantly reduced (WL:-2.1 ± 0.4; Control: 0.1 ± 0.3; p = 0.015). There was no significant difference in apoptotic or proliferation index between the groups. Among the other biomarkers, triglyceride, and insulin levels were significantly decreased in the WL compared with the control group.

Conclusions

In summary, this short-term WL program prior to radical prostatectomy resulted in significantly more WL in the intervention vs. the control group and was accompanied by significant reductions in body fat mass, circulating triglycerides, and insulin. However, no significant changes were observed in malignant epithelium apoptosis or proliferation. Future studies should consider a longer term or more intensive weight loss intervention.

### Regulation of energy homeostasis by the ubiquitin-independent REG γ proteasome [^115QWF67]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Our study also reveals that the REGγ-proteasome is strongly linked to tumour-starving cancer therapy. Caloric restriction has long been considered as a promising approach for cancer therapy. However, in response to starvation, cells always reduce energy consuming, and thereby decrease the effects of nutrient limitation on killing tumours. For example, the eNoSC-induced epigenetic rDNA silencing contributes to protection of cells from glucose starvation-induced apoptosis. Thereby, the intracellular energy-saving response impairs the effectiveness of metabolism inhibitors in killing tumours. In this study, we show that knockdown of REGγ is sufficient to promote both GD- and 2DG-induced energy consumption and cell death, and, as a result, increases tumour killing efficacy of 2DG in vivo. REGγ has been shown to protect cells against apoptosis by inhibiting p53 (ref.), but our results here show that p53 is not essential for starvation-induced cell death in REGγ-deficient cells. In contrast, we observed that double knockdown of SirT7 significantly decreased GD- and 2DG-induced cell death in REGγ-knockdown cells, indicating that the endogenous SirT7, at least in part, contributes to starvation-induced cell death in REGγ-deficient cells. However, there remains the possibility that REGγ protects cells from starvation-induced cell death via other pathways as well. Of note, aberrant expression of REGγ was observed in some types of tumours; thus it is tempting to further investigate whether pharmacological manipulation of REGγ could provide cancer-starving benefits.

In summary, we identify a role of REGγ proteasome in rDNA transcription, energy consumption and cell fate decision under energy stress conditions. This study expands the current knowledge of Ub-independent proteasome in protein and energy homeostasis. In addition, knockdown of REGγ significantly increased 2DG-induced tumour growth inhibition and cancer cell death both in vivo and in vitro. These results lead us to propose that specific inhibition of REGγ proteasome may restore tumour sensitivity to energy starvation.

### Transcription factor NF κ B regulates the expression of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 [^1164WzCS]. Clinical Epigenetics (2013). Low credibility.

The human deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) shares the highest degree of homology of all mammalian sirtuins with the yeast protein SIR2. SIRT1 localizes predominantly to the cell nucleus and deacetylates both histones (preferably H4 K16) and non-histone proteins. SIRT1 antagonizes the histone acetyltransferase p300, which acetylates all histones and some non-histone proteins such as p53 and FOXO3a. SIRT1 is involved in a number of cellular regulation mechanisms affecting cellular lifespan, stress resistance, apoptosis and cell metabolism. The prolongation of cellular lifespan under conditions of caloric restriction has been known for quite some time. It has been described for a number of very different organisms ranging from yeast to nematodes to mammals and has been reported to be associated with SIRT1. Caloric restriction causes an increase in the production of NAD + and goes along with increased levels of SIRT1 mRNA as well as with increased SIRT1 activity. The positive influence of SIRT1 on longevity in mammals has been reported to depend on increased stress resistance and reduced apoptosis. In addition to the modification of histone proteins, SIRT1 also carries the ability to inactivate a number of non-histone proteins by deacetylation. One of the most prominent examples for this mechanism is the deacetylation of tumor suppressor protein p53. The transcription factor p53 triggers apoptosis in the case of DNA damage or oxidative stress and plays a key role in cellular defense against the development of malignant transformation. The inactivation of p53 by SIRT1 may retard apoptosis and render cells more resistant to oxidative stress. On the other hand, overexpression of SIRT1 may also promote carcinogenesis because of its inhibitory effect on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The forkhead proteins constitute another group of proteins that is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis, stress resistance and metabolism; these proteins are reported to be regulated by SIRT1.

### Molecular pathways: the PERKs and pitfalls of targeting the unfolded protein response in cancer [^114cneLa]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly specialized organelle that provides an oxidizing, profolding environment for protein synthesis and maturation. The ER also hosts a dynamic signaling network that can sense and respond to physiologic changes that affect its environment, thereby influencing overall cell fate. Limitation of nutrients and oxygen have a direct effect on the efficiency of protein folding in the ER, and are classic inducers of the ER resident signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Not only does the UPR regulate ER homeostasis in normal cells experiencing such stress, but strong evidence also suggests that tumor cells can co-opt the cytoprotective aspects of this response to survive the hypoxic, nutrient-restricted conditions of the tumor microenvironment.

### Daily caloric restriction limits tumor growth more effectively than caloric cycling regardless of dietary composition [^116Fvn26]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cancer incidence increases with age and is a leading cause of death. Caloric restriction (CR) confers benefits on health and survival and delays cancer. However, due to CR's stringency, dietary alternatives offering the same cancer protection have become increasingly attractive. Short cycles of a plant-based diet designed to mimic fasting (FMD) are protective against tumorigenesis without the chronic restriction of calories. Yet, it is unclear whether the fasting time, level of dietary restriction, or nutrient composition is the primary driver behind cancer protection. Using a breast cancer model in mice, we compare the potency of daily CR to that of periodic caloric cycling on FMD or an isocaloric standard laboratory chow against primary tumor growth and metastatic burden. Here, we report that daily CR provides greater protection against tumor growth and metastasis to the lung, which may be in part due to the unique immune signature observed with daily CR.

### Energy and caloric restriction, and fasting and cancer: a narrative review [^111J6gWr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diet-related obesity is a known risk factor for numerous aging-related diseases and several types of cancers, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, and prostate cancer. In cancer patients, obesity is associated with an increased risk for disease recurrence and higher disease-specific or overall mortality.

Preclinical studies have shown that caloric restriction (CR) can protect animals against the toxic effects of chemotherapy, while also enhancing the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents.

Thus, this review will examine the current knowledge concerning the mechanisms that explain normal and cancer cells' responses to CR. Moreover, it summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data that addressed the impact of CR on cancer incidence, and its potential effects on enhancing efficacy and reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

### Targeting cancer metabolism: dietary and pharmacologic interventions [^1168qXC8]. Cancer Discovery (2016). Low credibility.

Most tumors display oncogene-driven reprogramming of several metabolic pathways, which are crucial to sustain their growth and proliferation. In recent years, both dietary and pharmacologic approaches that target deregulated tumor metabolism are beginning to be considered for clinical applications. Dietary interventions exploit the ability of nutrient-restricted conditions to exert broad biological effects, protecting normal cells, organs, and systems, while sensitizing a wide variety of cancer cells to cytotoxic therapies. On the other hand, drugs targeting enzymes or metabolites of crucial metabolic pathways can be highly specific and effective, but must be matched with a responsive tumor, which might rapidly adapt. In this review, we illustrate how dietary and pharmacologic therapies differ in their effect on tumor growth, proliferation, and metabolism and discuss the available preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of or against each of them. We also indicate, when appropriate, how to optimize future investigations on metabolic therapies on the basis of tumor- and patient-related characteristics.

Significance

To our knowledge, this is the first review article that comprehensively analyzes the preclinical and preliminary clinical experimental foundations of both dietary and pharmacologic metabolic interventions in cancer therapy. Among several promising therapies, we propose treatment personalization on the basis of tumor genetics, tumor metabolism, and patient systemic metabolism. Cancer Discov; 6(12); 1315–33. ©2016 AACR.

### Energy and caloric restriction, and fasting and cancer: a narrative review [^111Vjnzn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Dietary interventions have a significant impact on body metabolism. The sensitivity of cancer cells to nutrient and energy deficiency is an evolving characteristic of cancer biology. Preclinical studies provided robust evidence that energy and caloric restrictions could hinder both cancer growth and progression, besides enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Moreover, several, albeit low-powered, clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefits in cancer patients. Future research will inform and firmly establish the potential efficacy and safety of these dietary interventions. Here, we review the current evidence and ongoing research investigating the relationship between various dietary restriction approaches and cancer outcomes.

### Α-tocopheryl succinate promotes selective cell death induced by vitamin K3 in combination with ascorbate [^117XbwxS]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Standard cancer therapy is plagued by undesirable adverse side-effects, including toxicity to normal cells and evasion of immune surveillance. These drawbacks have fuelled efforts to develop new anti-cancer agents and additional and/or complementary strategies to inhibit cancer cell growth. These strategies include approaches such as cancer immunotherapy, caloric restriction; genetic manipulation; a concomitant increase of the therapeutic effect of anti-cancer drugs while reducing undesirable secondary effects; or potentiation of the anti-tumour therapeutic effects of drugs by their combination. Drug combination is a promising strategy to overcome side-effects associated with high doses of single drugs.

The combined action of ascorbic acid (AA) and vitamin K3 (VK3) has been reported to synergistically induce cell death in different cancers. Oxidative stress generated by the ascorbate-driven quinone redox cycling kills tumour cells by a mechanism including glycolysis inhibition, loss of calcium homoeostasis, DNA damage, and altered activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In this case, cell death involves necrosis rather than apoptosis or macroautophagy. Pharmacological doses of AA (> 0.2 m) are required to induce oxidation-dependent cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Cells convert ascorbate to the ascorbyl radical (A −) with concomitant formation of H 2 O 2 in extracellular fluids, resulting in toxicity towards tumour cells. However, this approach faces a possible complications in that the therapeutic synergy of the drug combination could be accompanied by deleterious side-effects, and by the possibility that the extracellular levels of H 2 O 2 main drop below 1 μ, at which concentration proliferation rather than cell death may be promoted.

### Caloric restriction and activity to reduce… [^114wRBcD]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Caloric Restriction and Activity to Reduce Chemoresistance in B-ALL This study is for older children, adolescents, and young adults with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Higher amounts of body fat is associated with resistance to chemotherapy in patients with B-ALL. Chemotherapy during the first month causes large gains in body fat in most people, even those who start chemotherapy at a healthy weight. This study is being done to find out if caloric restriction achieved by a personalized nutritional menu and exercise plan during routine chemotherapy can make the patient's ALL more sensitive to chemotherapy and also reduce the amount of body fat gained during treatment. The goals of this study are to help make chemotherapy more effective in treating the patient's leukemia as demonstrated by fewer patients with leukemia minimal residual disease while also trying to reduce the amount of body fat that chemotherapy causes the patient to gain in the first month.

The other side of AMPK activation

Although many studies support the tumor-suppressive role of AMPK, emerging evidence suggests that under certain circumstances, activation of AMPK protects against cell death. Indeed, activated AMPK confers metabolic adaptation to tumor cells which reduce anabolic reactions. Under nutrient starvation activated AMPK promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. Not only AMPK activation maintains ATP levels but it also maintains NADPH levels which is crucial since it participates in redox regulation and cell survival. When activated, AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase and consequently the consumption of NADPH for fatty acid synthesis. In addition, it activates fatty acid oxidation which generates NADPH.

Constitutive adaptation to energy stress has been shown in pancreatic cancer cells, and this tolerance to low glucose was attributable to the high expression level of AMPK. Knockdown of the catalytic unit of AMPK diminished the ability of cells to grow in glucose-free media. More recently, Park et al. showed that the downregulation of the AMPK α1 and α2 subunits inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis. This other aspect of AMPK activation is important and requires attention when considering using AMPK activators for therapeutic use.
