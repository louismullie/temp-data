## Question

what are the most likely diagnoses for a patient with low t4 but normal TSH and what are the treatment options?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most likely diagnoses for a patient with low free T4 and normal TSH, as well as the available treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this pattern fits central hypothyroidism versus other causes. Then, I should verify potential confounders like assay interference, medications, and nonthyroidal illness. Next, I will outline the key history, exam, and laboratory steps to confirm central disease and exclude mimics. Finally, I will consider treatment principles, monitoring targets, and when to involve endocrinology, making sure I double-check areas where guidelines differ or where I might overstate certainty.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical pattern and its physiologic implications. Low free T4 with a normal TSH is inappropriate for primary hypothyroidism, where TSH should be elevated due to loss of negative feedback; this discordance should prompt suspicion for central hypothyroidism from pituitary or hypothalamic disease, or for a secondary process altering TSH secretion or assay interpretation, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on primary thyroid failure here [^115pVsK9] [^114Kj5JG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the most likely diagnosis first. Central hypothyroidism is the leading consideration when free T4 is low and TSH is inappropriately normal or mildly low, especially in the context of pituitary disease, prior surgery, radiation, infiltrative disease, or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; I should confirm this pattern on repeat testing and correlate with pituitary history and symptoms of other pituitary deficiencies [^115pVsK9] [^114Kj5JG] [^116qUyhM].

> Wait, let me verify potential mimics and confounders before labeling this as central disease. Nonthyroidal illness can lower T4 and suppress TSH, producing a pattern that can resemble central hypothyroidism; medications such as glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, and somatostatin analogs suppress TSH, and amiodarone can cause complex thyroid test abnormalities; assay interference or biotin supplementation can artifactually alter immunoassays; acute psychiatric states may transiently elevate free T4 with nonsuppressed TSH, which is the opposite of this case but reminds me to check for transient or iatrogenic causes before committing to lifelong therapy [^114P4yom] [^113XpJMe] [^113Fad1b].

> I need to check the history and examination carefully. I should ask about headaches, visual changes, galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, decreased libido, adrenal or gonadal symptoms, and any history of pituitary surgery, radiation, head trauma, or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. On exam I should look for signs of hypothyroidism, bitemporal hemianopia or other field defects, and features of other pituitary hormone deficiencies, because these findings materially increase the pretest probability of central hypothyroidism and guide the scope of pituitary testing [^115pVsK9] [^116qUyhM].

> Next, I should review the laboratory confirmation strategy. I will repeat TSH and free T4 to ensure persistence, then measure morning cortisol with ACTH to screen for secondary adrenal insufficiency, and assess gonadal axes and prolactin. Pituitary MRI is indicated when central hypothyroidism is suspected or confirmed to evaluate for mass lesions, infiltrative disease, or hypophysitis. I should avoid relying on TSH to diagnose or monitor central hypothyroidism, as TSH can be misleadingly normal or low in this setting [^115pVsK9] [^116NdwWZ] [^114Kj5JG].

> Let me consider additional differentials if the clinical context suggests them. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma would typically present with elevated free T4 and T3 alongside an inappropriately normal or elevated TSH, which is the opposite of this pattern, but I should keep it in mind if thyroid hormones are high; resistance to thyroid hormone beta presents with elevated free T4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH, again not this pattern; isolated low T4 with normal TSH can also be seen in nonthyroidal illness, so I should confirm stability of the axis after recovery before diagnosing central hypothyroidism [^115N9GwJ] [^111t4S1w] [^114P4yom].

> I should double-check the treatment principles before recommending therapy. If central hypothyroidism is confirmed, levothyroxine is indicated. Importantly, I must treat adrenal insufficiency first if present to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis, and I should not use TSH to titrate levothyroxine in central disease. Instead, I will target free T4 in the upper half of the reference range, adjusting for age and comorbidities, and monitor clinically and biochemically at appropriate intervals [^115pVsK9] [^112GQShE] [^113m2fbv].

> Let me verify monitoring and follow-up specifics. After initiating or adjusting levothyroxine, I should recheck free T4 in about 6 to 8 weeks and titrate to keep free T4 in the upper reference range while watching for overtreatment; in older adults or those with cardiac disease, I will aim lower and titrate more slowly; I should also periodically reassess other pituitary axes and maintain vigilance for evolving pituitary disease or treatment-related changes [^112GQShE].

> But wait, what if the low T4 with normal TSH is transient due to illness or medication. If nonthyroidal illness or a confounding drug is likely, I should defer long-term thyroid hormone therapy, treat the underlying condition, and re-evaluate thyroid function after recovery. If assay interference is suspected, I should repeat testing on a different platform or after stopping biotin and consider sending samples to a reference lab before making a definitive diagnosis [^114P4yom] [^113Fad1b].

> I need to ensure appropriate referral thresholds are met. Any confirmed central hypothyroidism warrants endocrinology involvement for comprehensive pituitary evaluation, MRI interpretation, and long-term management. Urgent referral is indicated if there are red flags such as severe headache, visual symptoms, or evidence of adrenal insufficiency, given the risk of mass effect and the need to treat adrenal failure before thyroid replacement [^notfound].

> In summary, I should confirm that low free T4 with normal TSH most strongly suggests central hypothyroidism, but I must systematically exclude assay interference, nonthyroidal illness, and medication effects. Then, with repeat testing, a full pituitary hormone panel, and MRI when indicated, I can proceed with levothyroxine therapy while avoiding TSH-based titration and ensuring adrenal sufficiency, with individualized free T4 targets and close follow-up to optimize outcomes [^115pVsK9] [^112GQShE] [^113Fad1b].

Low free T4 with normal TSH most often reflects **central hypothyroidism** (pituitary or hypothalamic disease) [^115pVsK9] or **non-thyroidal illness syndrome** (NTIS) [^114P4yom]. Less common causes include **assay interference** [^113Fad1b], **medications** (glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs) [^113XpJMe], or **congenital TSH deficiency**. Management is cause-specific: treat central hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and monitor free T4 (not TSH) [^112GQShE]; treat NTIS by addressing the underlying illness and avoid thyroid hormone unless clearly indicated [^114P4yom]; and confirm assay interference or medication effects before treating [^11385f4o].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Central hypothyroidism | Pituitary or hypothalamic disease | - insufficient TSH secretion <br/> - low FT4 with normal/low TSH | - fatigue <br/> - weight gain <br/> - cold intolerance <br/> - other pituitary deficits [^116qUyhM] |
| Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) | Severe illness | - reduced TSH <br/> - low FT4 <br/> - low T3 | - critical illness <br/> - malnutrition <br/> - surgery [^114P4yom] |
| Assay interference | Laboratory error | - false low FT4 <br/> - normal TSH | - no symptoms <br/> - unexpected labs [^11385f4o] |
| Medications | - glucocorticoids <br/> - dopamine agonists <br/> - somatostatin analogs | Suppressed TSH secretion | - drug history <br/> - reversible on withdrawal [^114P4yom] |
| Congenital TSH deficiency | Genetic TSH deficiency | - low FT4 <br/> - normal TSH | Neonatal/childhood onset [^1176uMh1] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Confirm results**: Repeat FT4 and TSH to exclude lab error [^112MTEEc].
- **Clinical context**: Assess for pituitary disease, severe illness, or medications [^114P4yom].
- **Additional tests**: Free T3, pituitary hormones, MRI if central disease suspected [^115N9GwJ].
- **Assay interference**: Consider heterophile antibodies or biotin use [^notfound].

---

## Treatment options

### Central hypothyroidism

- **Levothyroxine**: Standard therapy; monitor FT4 (not TSH) [^112GQShE].
- **Dosing**: Start low and titrate to FT4 in the upper-normal range [^112GQShE].
- **Monitoring**: Adjust to keep FT4 in the upper-normal range [^112GQShE].

---

### Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)

In non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), **treat the underlying illness** and avoid thyroid hormone unless clearly indicated [^114P4yom]. Reserve thyroid hormone for **severe, persistent hypothyroidism** after the acute illness resolves.

---

### Assay interference or medication-induced

For assay interference or medication-induced low FT4, **identify and remove the interfering substance** or **discontinue the offending drug** when feasible. Recheck thyroid function after the interference has been addressed.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should track **FT4 and clinical response**; in central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable [^112GQShE]. Adjust levothyroxone to maintain FT4 in the upper-normal range [^116AqRuH]. Continue regular follow-up to assess symptoms, adherence, and adverse effects.

---

Low free T4 with normal TSH most often reflects **central hypothyroidism** or **NTIS**; management is cause-specific, with levothyroxine for central disease and treatment of the underlying illness for NTIS, while confirming and removing assay or medication interferences before initiating therapy.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Kumyp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. The issues are exemplified and particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are paralleled in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth stimulating hormone. Even when only present at a low level in the circulation it was believed that it could potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumour cells and thereby promote the relapse of the thyroid cancer in the long-term. This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients. However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints of such a far-reaching decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be done in a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients followed at a single institution, much lower than in the subsequent years when the relaxed TSH policy came into effect (Fig. 1). The reverse was true for hyperthyroid complaints reported by patients, which were relatively higher in the first and much lower in the second time period (Fig. 1). The symptom reporting by these patients indicates a historical shift in the trend from a lack of hypothyroid symptoms on LT4 towards an increased awareness of the persisting symptomatology. While the nature, reliability and accuracy of freely communicated symptoms may be questionable it appears that the opposing trends in these rates in the same patients are well documented in this cohort, and they occurred in association with an important change in the treatment policy during follow-up. We are not aware of any prospective studies that followed this historic shift in the pattern of patient complaints during the last decade. The changing pattern in patient complaints observed in this cohort and associated with the low-dose policy promoted by recent guidelines is mirrored in a recent prospective study and by a dramatic increase in patients worldwide expressing their concerns and dissatisfaction with the standard treatment in various ways including over the internet and through patient advocacies. This sentiment was confirmed by a large online survey of 12,146 hypothyroid patients conducted by the American Thyroid Association.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^115U9TtT]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — recommendations for evaluation and treatment in infertility and pregnancy emphasize non-treatment for SCH and targeted thyroid testing. It is not recommended to treat pregnant women or women desiring pregnancy who have a diagnosis of SCH with levothyroxine, as treatments have not been demonstrated to reduce pregnancy loss nor to improve clinical pregnancy or LB outcomes (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate). Thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 levels should be tested in patients with signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism (including irregular menstrual cycles) rather than in all patients with infertility (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate).

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^116y3PNk]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) in subclinical hypothyroidism — treatment target and threshold: Subclinically hypothyroid women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) should be treated with LT4, and the goal of treatment is to achieve a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration < 2.5 mU/L; it therefore seems prudent to recommend treatment of subclinically hypothyroid women seeking pregnancy with ART for any TSH elevation > 2.5 mU/L. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^114P4yom]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonthyroidal illness — testing patterns, treatment stance, and special circumstances are summarized as follows: In chronically or markedly acutely ill patients, medications such as glucocorticoids, amiodarone, and dopamine may affect thyroid tests, and major illness or starvation may yield a low serum T 4 with normal or low serum T 3 and TSH levels; since evidence shows L-thyroxine or L-triiodothyronine is of no benefit in such settings, patients who are not clearly hypothyroid should not be treated until their acute medical condition has resolved, though a 2010 study showed that infants under 5 months of age undergoing cardiac surgery for complex congenital heart disease benefited from intravenous L-triiodothyronine, and patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure with low serum T 3 levels have been shown to benefit from intravenous L-triiodothyronine to restore serum T 3 levels to normal; evaluation by a clinical endocrinologist is appropriate before initiating thyroid hormone treatment.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^115mtWCN]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider initiating levothyroxine therapy in patients with pituitary disease and low/normal free T4 levels suspected to have mild CeH if suggestive symptoms are present, or monitoring free T4 levels over time and initiating treatment if the free T4 level decreases by ≥ 20%.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) in hypopituitary patients — diagnostic considerations emphasize that low-normal free thyroxine (fT4) may suggest CH, but confirmation is difficult because there are no validated thyroid function measures in this population; studies have suggested that 10–18% of high-risk pituitary patients have unrecognized CH with low-normal fT4 levels, and suggested approaches for patients with low-normal fT4 levels include starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20%; serum T3 or free T3 (fT3) levels are generally not helpful, peripheral indices of thyroid hormone action lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity, and classifying CH based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness to exogenous TSH-releasing hormone has not proven useful in clinical practice.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

4) or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. Should We Treat Subclinical Hypothyroidism. Indications for treatment in subclinical hypothyroidism are not established, but general guidelines can be offered. Greater magnitude and duration of TSH elevation and higher titers of antithyroid antibodies increase the probability that the condition will progress to overt hypothyroidism and, therefore, increase the potential benefit of treatment with levothyroxine. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased. Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range.

An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. Treatment Treatment is similar to that recommended in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the agent of choice, rather than a preparation containing tri-iodothyronine, since T 3 has a short half-life and requires multiple daily doses to maintain blood levels in the normal range. Levothyroxine, however, has a long half-life and is partially converted to T 3 in the body, resulting in a constant physiologic blood level of both T 4 and T 3 with a single daily dose.
15. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, because of the minimal extent of the thyroid hormone deficiency, may be controlled with total daily dosages of levothyroxine as low as 25 to 50 μg. This initial dosage should be maintained for six to eight weeks before a TSH measurement is repeated to guide adjustment of the levothyroxine dosage.

The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months.

Conclusions

Patients with CH benefit from neonatal screening, which makes it possible to initiate essential replacement therapy immediately. This consensus highlights the need to identify clear cutoff points for CH screening, without increasing the number of false-positive results. However, the results of long-term prospective studies in subjects with false-positive results are not yet available for the formulation of evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management. Based on current outcome data, an immediate treatment should be initiated, and it appears necessary to maintain adequate L-T 4 treatment throughout the lifespan for most patients, with a particular emphasis on treatment in the first years of life and of treatment optimization in pregnant women with CH. Careful neurodevelopmental and neurosensory evaluations should be started early in life and repeated at important critical developmental phases, taking into account disease severity at diagnosis and providing appropriate interventions as required. Subsequent efforts should focus on educating both patients and caregivers to ensure that adequate treatment is continued into adulthood. Future research should aim to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous disorder and to determine whether knowledge of the specific defect in thyroid development or function is likely to improve patient care and outcomes.

The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Central hypothyroidism: advances in etiology, diagnostic challenges, therapeutic targets, and associated risks [^1116i226]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Central hypothyroidism is a rare disorder resulting from impaired thyroid hormone production due to deficiencies in TSH secretion from the pituitary or TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism, with an emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on genetic and acquired causes, particularly those related to hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and the effects of surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions. Diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies, including levothyroxine therapy and monitoring, are analyzed.

Results

Early diagnosis requires simultaneous measurement of free T4 and TSH to prevent neurological sequelae, especially in congenital cases. Central hypothyroidism is associated with risks such as growth and developmental impairment, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances. Levothyroxine therapy is crucial for correcting hormonal deficits and improving patient outcomes; however, careful dosing is necessary to avoid potential complications, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Conclusions

Personalized treatment and continuous monitoring are essential to optimize clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life in affected individuals. A thorough understanding of central hypothyroidism's etiology and management is necessary to improve early detection and therapeutic strategies.

Hypophysitis

Hypophysitis is most commonly seen with anti CTLA-4 antibody monotherapy (ipilimumab, with an incidence of ≤ 10% at a dose of 3 mg/kg and up to 17% at 10 mg/kg), and with combination ipilimumab/nivolumab (incidence ≤ 13%). The median time from starting ipilimumab to diagnosis of hypophysitis is 8–9 weeks, or after the third dose of ipilimumab. Symptoms commonly include headache (85%) and fatigue (66%); visual changes are uncommon. Clinical suspicion of hypophysitis is frequently raised when routine thyroid function testing shows a low TSH with low free T4, suggestive of a central etiology. Patients have various degrees of anterior pituitary hormonal deficiency, with central hypothyroidism being most commonly seen (> 90%), followed by central adrenal insufficiency, which is also found in the majority of patients. Both central hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency occur in > 75% of patients and approximately 50% of patients present with panhypopituitarism (adrenal insufficiency plus hypothyroidism plus hypogonadism). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella, pituitary enlargement can precede the development of clinical and biochemical evidence of disease. MRI abnormalities, such as stalk thickening, suprasellar convexity, heterogeneous enhancement, and increased height of the gland as compared with baseline scans (when available) are present in most patients at the time of diagnosis. Resolution of pituitary enlargement is common, with all cases resolved on follow up scans after two months.

All patients with suspected hypophysitis based on clinical findings (headache, fatigue) or biochemical evaluation (routine thyroid function testing showing low free T4 with low/normal TSH) should undergo further testing for diagnostic confirmation. Recommended tests, preferably conducted in the morning around 8 am, include thyroid function (TSH, free T4), adrenal function (ACTH, cortisol or 1 mcg cosyntropin stimulation test), gonadal hormones (testosterone in men, estradiol in women), follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH]) and MRI of the sella, with pituitary cuts. This should be done prior to administration of steroids. Strict criteria for diagnostic confirmation of hypophysitis are not currently available. Proposed confirmation criteria include ≥ 1 pituitary hormone deficiency (TSH or ACTH deficiency required) combined with an MRI abnormality, or ≥ 2 pituitary hormone deficiencies (TSH or ACTH deficiency required) in the presence of headache and other symptoms.

Main text

In this article, we take a closer look how these technical changes may have impacted on patient care. A transition occurred from the era of low metabolic rate regarded as synonymous with hypothyroidism to a purely biochemically based definition. Hence, TSH measurement became the new determinant of hypothyroidism. Consequently, treatment habits changed over the last decade and were more related to laboratory records than subjective patient experience. In particular, LT4 replacement doses tended to decrease, as a suppressed TSH was viewed as evidence of overtreatment. However, for two reasons this is an area of considerable uncertainty. Firstly, thyroid-related patient complaints overlap with a plethora of non-specific symptoms caused by other conditions and diseases. Thyroid tests are also more likely to be obtained in patients with unspecific symptoms. In these conditions, LT4 treatment may not be superior to placebo in symptom alleviation. Secondly, TSH is increasingly recognised to be less reliable as a definitive diagnostic tool than previously assumed. Not only is its reference interval not universally agreed on or adjusted for various influences, such as ethnicity, iodine supply, age, but the univariate statistical derivation of a TSH reference range is inherently ill-defined owing to its nature as a controlling element. Physiologically, stimulation by TSH raises thyroid hormones to a level appropriate to the optimal well-being of a person. Because TSH, FT4 and FT3 are interrelated through the operation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback regulation, integrated pairs of TSH and FT4 values define the so-called individual set points. Unlike a population-based univariate reference interval, set points are subject to multivariate normality and narrow homeostatic ranges. When plotting TSH against FT4 concentrations the resulting distribution in a healthy population does not describe the familiar rectangle, but a kite-shaped area. Accordingly, a TSH value can be indicative of true euthyroidism in an individual despite it slightly exceeding the upper reference limit, while a TSH measurement within that reference interval may represent a truly hypothyroid subject. Isolated TSH interpretation thereby becomes ambiguous, resulting in unacceptable diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty surrounding a given TSH measurement when it approaches the TSH euthyroid range. As a consequence, this strategy divorces diagnostic disease definitions from treatment targets. Rationally therefore, the triple roles of TSH as a screening test, diagnostic tool and therapeutic target require separate assessment. Diagnostic reliability for patients may be improved by reconstructing personal TSH-FT4 set points, depending on whether this novel approach can be confirmed in clinical trials.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

Thyroid hormone analogs and resistance to thyroid hormone — treatment goals and role of analogs are stated as follows: "The therapeutic goals of the treatment of patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone are to improve the symptoms caused by excessive TRα signaling, while minimizing the symptoms caused by deficient TRβ signaling". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. "Although preliminary data from small case series suggest that the use of TRIAC in patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone may be promising, more clinical research is needed before the use of thyroid hormone analogs can be recommended for this indication". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Mechanistic background notes that resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare genetic disease with increased serum TSH and inappropriately normal or increased FT4; patients with RTHα have normal TSH with low FT4 and high T3, whereas patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated TSH with elevated FT4 and FT3; most forms are autosomal dominant TRβ mutations, and approximately 1000 patients in 350 families with TRβ mutations have been described.

Method of thyroid re-evaluation — For a precise diagnosis, L‑T4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period with re‑evaluation at the end including biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed; alternatively, L‑T4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks, and if TSH increases to ≥ 10 mU/l continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed, whereas if thyroid function remains normal the dose may be reduced further followed by retesting. By the age of 2 to 3 years, severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or high TSH levels despite treatment in cases of imperfect compliance.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^114gSiVd]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: a 2020–2021 consensus guidelines update-an ENDO-European reference network initiative endorsed by the European society for pediatric endocrinology and the European society for endocrinology [^116DGLsu]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This update of the consensus guidelines on CH recommends worldwide neonatal screening and appropriate diagnostics — including genetics — to assess the cause of both primary and central hypothyroidism. The expert panel recommends the immediate start of correctly dosed LT4 treatment, and frequent follow-up including laboratory testing and dose adjustments to keep TH levels in their target ranges, timely assessments of the need to continue treatment, attention for neurodevelopmental and neurosensory functions and, if necessary, consulting other health professionals, and education of the child and family about CH. Harmonization of diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up will optimize patient outcomes. Lastly, all individuals with CH are entitled to a well-planned transition of care from pediatrics to adult medicine. This consensus guidelines update should be used to further optimize detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of children with all forms of CH in the light of the most recent evidence. It should be helpful in convincing health authorities of the benefits of neonatal screening for CH. Despite ∼50 years of neonatal screening for CH, some important questions remain, such as the genetic etiology of TD, the assumed harm of subclinical CH, that is, a normal fT4 in combination with an elevated TSH, and the cause of the gradually increased incidence of CH with GIS. Further epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to understand the increased incidence of this condition.

Adult hypothyroidism — scope, screening, and therapy emphasize that the guidelines primarily address ambulatory patients with biochemically confirmed primary hypothyroidism whose thyroid status has been stable for at least several weeks and do not deal with myxedema coma. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations but is not sufficient for assessing hospitalized patients or when central hypothyroidism is either present or suspected, and the standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine which must be tailored to the individual patient.

### Treatment… [^112qkTRq]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

12 If the serum TSH level is elevated, testing should be repeated with a serum free thyroxine measurement. Overt primary hypothyroidism is indicated with an elevated serum TSH level and a low serum free T 4 level. An elevated serum TSH level with a normal range serum free T 4 level is consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. A low serum free T 4 level with a low, or inappropriately normal, serum TSH level is consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and will usually be associated with further evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency. It is important to interpret these measurements within the context of the laboratory-specific normative range for each test. Diurnal variations exist in TSH secretion such that the lowest level will generally be obtained with a morning laboratory draw.

25 They concluded that potentially flawed pharmacokinetic methods, combined with the lack of TSH measurements to establish bioequivalence, could lead to significant under- and overestimations of generic equivalency compared with brand-name levothyroxine products. 25 Therefore, they recommend that patients be started and maintained on either brand-name or generic levothyroxine preparations, and not switched back and forth between the two. Patients who do switch products should undergo repeat TSH and free T 4 testing in six weeks to ensure normal range levels. Combination T 3/T 4 therapy, in the form of desiccated thyroid hormone preparations or levothyroxine plus liothyronine, is sometimes prescribed for patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism.

|Vitamin D deficiency| Desiccated thyroid hormone preparations are not recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the treatment of hypothyroidism, and a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials of combination T. 32 Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers also increase the risk of progressing to frank thyroid gland failure, even when the TSH level is less than 10 mIU per L. Treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for patients with initial TSH levels greater than 10 mIU per L, patients with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and TSH levels between 5 and 10 mIU per L, and for patients who are pregnant or are attempting to conceive. 15.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^113Fad1b]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1143FMWs]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — therapeutic endpoints and TSH targets indicate that the most reliable therapeutic endpoint for primary hypothyroidism is the serum TSH value, since confirmatory total T4, free T4, and T3 lack sufficient specificity as stand-alone endpoints; when serum TSH is within the normal range, free T4 will also be normal, whereas T3 may be in the lower reference range and occasionally mildly subnormal. The normal TSH range with an upper limit of 4.12 mIU/L is largely based on NHANES III, but some propose an upper normal of 2.5 or 3.0 mIU/L because the distribution is skewed by values between 3.1 and 4.12 mIU/L and mean/median are approximately 1.5 mIU/L; however, measurements vary up to 50% above and below the mean, and setting 2.5 mIU/L as the upper normal could yield more than 10 million additional diagnoses per year in the United States without clear-cut benefit.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^112wUhU4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement.

Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years. 37, 42 Patients who have a TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L are at higher risk of fracture, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure compared with patients who have a TSH level of 2. 0 to
2. 5 mIU per L.

16 In nonpregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy should be considered when the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the TPO antibody level is elevated. 16, 17, 34 The benefits of treating women with subclinical hypothyroidism who are pregnant or attempting to conceive are unclear. 17.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if patients have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

Summary

When no definitive diagnosis of permanent CH was made in the first weeks or months of life, then re-evaluation of the HPT axis after the age of 2 to 3 years is indicated, particularly in children with a GIS, and in those with presumed isolated central CH (1/++0).
For a precise diagnosis, LT4 treatment should be phased out over a 4 to 6 weeks period or just stopped, and full re-evaluation should be carried out after 4 weeks, consisting of (at least) fT4 and TSH measurement.
If primary hypothyroidism is confirmed (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L), consider thyroid imaging and, if possible, genetic testing; if central CH is likely (fT4 below the lower limit of the reference interval in combination with a low normal of only mildly elevated TSH), consider evaluating the other anterior pituitary functions and genetic testing.
If TSH is above the upper limit of the reference interval but < 10 mU/L (primary CH) or fT4 just above the lower limit of the reference interval (central CH), then continue withdrawal and retest in another 3 to 4 weeks (1/++0).
If a child with no permanent CH diagnosis and a GIS requires an LT4 dose < 3 μg/kg per day at the age of 6 months, then re-evaluation can be done already at that time (1/++0).
We recommend avoiding iodine as an antiseptic during peri- and neonatal period, as it can cause transient CH (1/++0).

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^113C7Ax4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.
