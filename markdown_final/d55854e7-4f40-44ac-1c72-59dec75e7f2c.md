## Question

High b12 level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage an elevated serum vitamin B12 level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify exogenous sources of B12. Next, I will consider serious underlying conditions that raise B12, including malignancy, liver and kidney disease, and hematologic disorders. After that, I need to check for functional B12 deficiency despite high serum levels. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic management plan, including when to stop supplements, what labs to order, imaging considerations, and follow-up intervals, while integrating the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pre-analytical or analytical issues, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a false-positive result. I should repeat the serum B12 measurement to verify persistence, and I should review the lab method and potential assay interference, since some platforms can misread binding protein variants or be affected by heterophilic antibodies, and macro-B12 complexes can artifactually elevate total B12 without increasing the active holotranscobalamin fraction [^111ttj6R] [^115oLWwy].

> Wait, let me verify exogenous sources next, because supplementation is the most common and reversible cause of high B12. I should ask explicitly about oral high-dose B12, sublingual or nasal formulations, and especially recent intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin, since hydroxocobalamin in particular can produce markedly elevated levels that persist for months after discontinuation, and even standard IM regimens can transiently raise serum B12 into the supraphysiologic range [^111ttj6R] [^1146SX2v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also consider serious disease associations, because persistently elevated B12 can be a paraneoplastic or organ-disease signal rather than a harmless finding. Large population-based cohorts show that plasma B12 above roughly 600–800 pmol/L is associated with a several-fold increase in incident cancer, particularly hematologic malignancies and smoking- or alcohol-related solid tumors, with the excess risk concentrated in the first year after detection, which argues for a careful cancer workup when no exogenous cause is identified [^116ouNKL] [^114ksFri] [^113XoZyb].

> I need to check for liver disease next, since hepatocellular injury and reduced hepatic clearance can increase circulating B12, and B12 may correlate with disease severity in cirrhosis and acute liver failure. In patients with chronic liver disease, optimizing micronutrients including B12 is recommended, but the elevated B12 itself is a marker rather than a treatment target, so I should interpret it in clinical context and consider abdominal ultrasound if hepatomegaly or abnormal liver enzymes are present [^113WUykF] [^117B25bm] [^115k2sEG].

> Let me consider kidney disease as well, because reduced renal clearance can raise serum B12, and in chronic kidney disease, B12 is included in the initial anemia evaluation. However, I should remember that in CKD, functional B12 deficiency can still coexist despite high serum levels, so I should not falsely reassure myself if the patient has macrocytosis or neuropathy, and I should integrate MMA and clinical findings rather than relying on total B12 alone [^117NdERU] [^115k2sEG].

> I will now examine hematologic disorders, since proliferating leukocytes can release haptocorrin-bound B12 and drive marked elevations. Case series and pediatric cohorts document high B12 in acute leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and multiple myeloma, and although the absolute risk is low, the relative risk compared with the general population appears elevated, so new or unexplained cytopenias, splenomegaly, or constitutional symptoms should prompt hematology referral and marrow evaluation as indicated [^1167GKyB] [^1137SHhF].

> But wait, what if the B12 is high and the patient is actually functionally deficient? Functional B12 deficiency can occur with normal or high serum B12 when transport or intracellular utilization is impaired, leading to elevated MMA and homocysteine despite abundant total B12. I should double-check MMA in any patient with compatible neurohematologic findings, and if suspected, treat the deficiency while investigating the cause, because relying on total B12 alone can delay diagnosis and risk irreversible neurologic injury [^1156SZDa] [^114X3ZYC] [^116QR9MP].

> Next, I should review a practical management algorithm. If an exogenous source is identified, I should stop B12 supplementation and recheck the level in about 3–4 months, since hydroxocobalamin can remain elevated for 6–7 months after cessation. If no exogenous source is found and the elevation is persistent, I should obtain a CBC, liver enzymes, creatinine with eGFR, LDH, and consider LDH and uric acid as disease activity markers, and I should have a low threshold for age-appropriate cancer screening and symptom-guided imaging such as abdominal ultrasound for liver or renal abnormalities. In children, expert pediatric guidance supports ultrasound and interval reassessment given the higher prevalence of liver and kidney disease in elevated B12 cohorts [^113jxEZz] [^111REVos] [^115k2sEG].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence. If no pathology is identified and the patient remains asymptomatic, repeating B12 in about 4 months is reasonable, and if chronic disease is present, periodic monitoring every 4–6 months may be prudent because levels can remain elevated and decline slowly even without ongoing supplementation. Persistent unexplained elevations warrant renewed consideration of occult malignancy or liver disease over time [^111REVos] [^1167GKyB].

> Let me reconsider the prognostic implications briefly. While some cohorts link high B12 to increased all-cause mortality, this association likely reflects reverse causation from underlying disease and inflammation rather than toxicity of B12 itself, and high-dose B12 intake has not been associated with higher mortality in adjusted analyses. Thus, I should treat the underlying condition rather than attempting to "lower" B12, and I should avoid attributing causality to B12 itself in the absence of mechanistic evidence [^113Ss1MJ] [^1125bbUV] [^113WUykF].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm the result, stop exogenous B12 if present, evaluate for malignancy, liver disease, kidney disease, and hematologic disorders, and test for functional deficiency when clinically suspected. This strategy aligns with observational and case-based evidence and helps balance the risk of overtesting with the potential to uncover serious disease early when B12 remains unexplained and persistently elevated [^116ouNKL] [^1137SHhF] [^1156SZDa].

High B12 levels are most often due to **supplements or injections** [^113jxEZz], but persistent elevation (> 1,000 pg/mL) without supplementation warrants evaluation for **liver disease, kidney dysfunction, hematologic malignancies, or solid tumors** [^116ouNKL] [^113XoZyb]. Macro-B12 complexes can cause **falsely high results** [^1146SX2v]; if suspected, confirm with **holo-transcobalamin** or **methylmalonic acid** testing [^116cZtCK] [^113vsPr6]. Management focuses on stopping exogenous B12, treating underlying conditions, and monitoring; **routine B12 lowering is not indicated** unless driven by the cause [^111REVos].

## Physiological basis of vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin essential for DNA synthesis, methylation reactions, and mitochondrial metabolism [^113VrFbh]. It is absorbed in the terminal ileum after binding to intrinsic factor, transported in plasma bound to haptocorrin and transcobalamin, and stored primarily in the liver [^111ttj6R]. Under normal conditions, **excess B12 is excreted by the kidneys**, maintaining homeostasis [^113MWuXq].

---

## Causes of elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 levels can be broadly categorized into **exogenous and endogenous causes**:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Exogenous | - High-dose oral supplements <br/> - Intramuscular injections (especially hydroxocobalamin) [^113jxEZz] <br/> - Parenteral nutrition [^113MWuXq] |
| Endogenous | - Liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) [^113WUykF] <br/> - Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, renal failure) [^117NdERU] <br/> - Hematologic malignancies (leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders) [^1167GKyB] <br/> - Solid tumors (lung, colorectal, pancreatic, breast) [^116ouNKL] <br/> - Macrocytosis (macro-B12 complexes) [^1146SX2v] <br/> - Inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) [^notfound] |

## Clinical significance of elevated vitamin B12 levels

While elevated B12 is often benign, persistent elevation without supplementation may signal **underlying pathology**:

- **Liver disease**: Increased release of B12 from damaged hepatocytes and reduced hepatic clearance [^113WUykF].
- **Kidney disease**: Reduced renal clearance of B12 and its carriers [^115k2sEG].
- **Hematologic malignancies**: Increased synthesis of haptocorrin by proliferating leukocytes [^1167GKyB].
- **Solid tumors**: Tumor-derived haptocorrin or altered B12 metabolism [^112cxq29].
- **Macro-B12**: Falsely elevated total B12 due to inactive complexes detected by immunoassays [^1146SX2v].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When evaluating elevated B12, a **structured approach is essential**:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat B12 measurement to exclude laboratory error.
- **Review history**: Assess supplement use, injections, diet, and symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, bone pain) [^111REVos].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver enzymes, renal function, LDH, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, holo-transcobalamin [^113vsPr6] [^116cZtCK].
- **Imaging**: Consider abdominal ultrasound or CT if liver/kidney disease or malignancy is suspected [^115k2sEG].
- **Specialized tests**: Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies for pernicious anemia if macrocytosis is present [^112yFs6M].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Elevated B12 is associated with increased risks, including:

- **Increased mortality**: Higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in population studies [^113Ss1MJ] [^1125bbUV].
- **Cancer risk**: Elevated risk of hematologic and solid tumors, especially within the first year of detection [^116ouNKL] [^113XoZyb].
- **Functional deficiency**: High serum B12 with low cellular availability due to transport or metabolic defects [^1156SZDa].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Stop supplementation**: Discontinue oral or injectable B12 if exogenous sources are identified [^111REVos].
- **Treat underlying disease**: Address liver, kidney, or hematologic conditions [^117B25bm].
- **Monitor**: Recheck B12 and clinical status periodically, especially in chronic disease [^111REVos].
- **Macro-B12**: Confirm with holo-transcobalamin or methylmalonic acid; no treatment needed if confirmed [^116cZtCK] [^113vsPr6].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the cause. Benign causes (supplementation, macro-B12) generally have an excellent outlook, whereas persistent elevation from liver or kidney disease or malignancy carries a guarded prognosis and requires targeted therapy and surveillance [^116ouNKL] [^113WUykF].

---

Elevated B12 is common and often reflects supplementation, but persistent high levels without supplementation should prompt evaluation for liver or kidney disease, hematologic malignancies, or solid tumors. A structured workup — confirming the result, reviewing history, and ordering targeted labs and imaging — guides diagnosis and management, which centers on stopping exogenous B12, treating the cause, and monitoring.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, [Cbl]) is a water-soluble vitamin primarily sourced from animal-derived foods. In humans, dietary proteins that contain Cbl are enzymatically hydrolyzed in the stomach and intestines, releasing the vitamin. Subsequently, the liberated Cbl binds to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells. The resulting IF-Cbl complex is actively absorbed in the terminal ileum and then released into the portal circulation. Within plasma, Cbl is bound either to transcobalamin II (hTC), its biologically active transporter, or to storage proteins collectively referred to as haptocorrins (HC), which include transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III. Approximately 6–20% of circulating Cbl is bound to hTC, whereas 80–94% is associated with HC. hTC is predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes and undergoes renal reabsorption. Vitamin B12 plays critical roles in nucleotide synthesis and methyl group transfer reactions. In pediatric populations, deficiency may manifest as megaloblastic anemia and neurological deficits.

Elevated serum Cbl levels are often regarded as benign by clinicians due to their asymptomatic nature, and there is no clear consensus regarding their clinical significance. The most commonly identified cause of elevated Cbl levels is high-dose Cbl supplementation. However, elevated Cbl levels have also been documented in conditions such as myeloproliferative disorders, leukemia, solid tumors, as well as liver and kidney diseases. Elevated serum Cbl may either be a consequence of an underlying pathology or represent its initial manifestation. Due to the scarcity of extensive studies, its interpretation remains challenging. Nevertheless, some studies in adults suggest associations between elevated serum Cbl levels and increased mortality and malignancies. In contrast, research investigating elevated Cbl levels in pediatric populations remains considerably limited.

In children with elevated serum Cbl levels, the underlying etiological factors remain largely unknown. Furthermore, there is insufficient information regarding the short- and long-term clinical consequences and appropriate management strategies for this condition. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratory findings in children presenting with markedly elevated Cbl levels, with the objective of identifying potential underlying causes and outcomes.

To explore the long-range effects of hydroxocobalamin injections upon B12 blood levels, the authors compared the effects of 10 to 14 weekly intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin in 50 persons. During the cyanocobalamin treatment, B12. blood levels remained in the range of 1, 000 to 1, 700 μμg/ml, but during hydroxocobalamin therapy they leveled off at an average of 8, 000 μμg/ml, with the maximal values reaching as high as 15, 000 μμg/ml. After discontinuation of the cyanocobalamin treatment, B12 blood levels reverted to normal within four to five weeks, but after hydroxocobalamin they did not return to the upper limit of the norm for six to seven months. At the end of the year, they were still about three times higher than before the treatment. Glass GBJ, Lee DH, Skeggs HR, Stanley JL. Hydroxocobalamin: III.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management… [^115k8wnV]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B 12 is crucial for neurologic function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis, and is a cofactor for three major reactions: the conversion of methylmalonic acid to succinyl coenzyme A; the conversion of homocysteine to methionine; and the conversion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. 1, 2. Screening and Diagnosis The recommended laboratory evaluation for patients with suspected vitamin B 12 deficiency includes a complete blood count and serum vitamin B 12 level. 2, 19–21 A level of less than 150 pg per mL is diagnostic for deficiency. 1, 2 Serum vitamin B 12 levels may be artificially elevated in patients with alcoholism, liver disease, or cancer because of decreased hepatic clearance of transport proteins and resultant higher circulating levels of vitamin B 12; physicians should use caution when interpreting laboratory results in these patients.

22, 23 In patients with a normal or low-normal serum vitamin B 12 level, complete blood count results demonstrating macrocytosis, or suspected clinical manifestations, a serum methylmalonic acid level is an appropriate next step 1, 2, 6, 18 and is a more direct measure of vitamin B 12's physiologic activity. 30 Patients older than 50 years may not be able to adequately absorb dietary vitamin B 12 and should consume food fortified with vitamin B 12. 30 Vegans and strict vegetarians should be counseled to consume fortified cereals or supplements to prevent deficiency. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery recommends that patients who have had bariatric surgery take 1 mg of oral vitamin B 12 per day indefinitely.
31. Vitamin B12 and Hyperhomocysteinemia Vitamin B 12 deficiency is a much more common cause of hyperhomocysteinemia in developed countries than folate deficiency because of widespread fortification of food with folate.

Although epidemiologic studies have shown an association between vascular disease and hyperhomocysteinemia, large randomized controlled trials have shown that lowering homocysteine levels in these patients does not reduce the number of myocardial infarctions or strokes, or improve mortality rates. 32 Similarly, an association between elevated homocysteine levels and cognitive impairment has been noted, but subsequent vitamin B 12 replacement does not have preventive or therapeutic benefit. 33.

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation, without neurological involvement, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for the treatment of patients with serum levels of subclinical deficiency on 2 occasions. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Reassess cobalamin levels after 3 months, and obtain second-line tests if there is no improvement.

Recommendations & conclusion

Clinicians should adopt a systematic approach when elevated serum Cbl levels are encountered. A comprehensive clinical history and detailed physical examination are essential during the initial evaluation. If the patient is receiving Cbl supplementation, it should be discontinued at the time of presentation, and appropriate follow-up assessments should be scheduled. In the absence of pathological findings, re-evaluation of serum Cbl levels after four months is recommended. If clinical or physical abnormalities are present, condition-specific investigations should be pursued. In cases where hepatic or renal involvement is suspected, abdominal ultrasonography may be warranted. Additionally, periodic monitoring of serum Cbl levels every four months may be considered for surveillance purposes. In individuals with chronic conditions, serum Cbl levels may remain elevated or decline more slowly, even in the absence of supplementation. Therefore, regular monitoring of serum Cbl levels in this population is advised, as persistent elevation may serve as an early indicator of potential hematologic disorders later in life.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^113XoZyb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) is an essential nutrient involved in one-carbon metabolism and cell division. Daily intake of 2 to 5 μg, together with efficient absorption, transportation, and transformation, are needed to maintain health. In clinical practice, measurement of total plasma Cbl is requested widely for the biochemical assessment of Cbl deficiency. Three studies have shown that a substantial proportion of patients for whom Cbl measurement is requested have plasma Cbl levels greater than the upper limit of the reference range, and two of these studies have shown an association between high Cbl levels and cancer.

The association between elevated plasma Cbl levels and cancer risk is poorly understood. On one hand, a high prevalence of elevated Cbl levels has been reported in patients with liver cancer, other solid tumors, and hematological malignancies. On the other hand, some studies have indicated a high prevalence of cancer, both hematological and solid tumors, among patients with high Cbl levels. However, the latter studies are limited by their cross-sectional design, and only one study included a comparison group of patients with normal and low plasma Cbl levels. Most studies on normal or low Cbl levels in relation to cancer have been negative, except for some studies showing associations between increasing Cbl levels and lung and prostate cancer.

Elevated plasma Cbl levels have also been associated with several nonmalignant diseases, including liver diseases, alcoholism, and renal, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Only a few patients with these diseases have high Cbl levels. Moreover, these diseases have been reported in a small proportion of patients with high Cbl levels.

To assess the possible clinical implications of elevated Cbl levels in diagnosing cancer, we conducted a population-based cohort study, examining the incidence of cancer diagnoses among patients with elevated plasma Cbl levels.

### Functional cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency: role of advanced age and disorders associated with increased oxidative stress [^116QR9MP]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Functional cobalamin (Cbl; vitamin B12) deficiency (that is, high levels of the Cbl-dependent metabolites, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), despite normal serum Cbl values) is common in the elderly and is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities, but its cause is unknown. As only reduced Cbls are metabolically active, the possibility that functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders having biomarkers indicative of increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) was considered.

Subjects/Methods

A retrospective record review of community-dwelling adults evaluated over a 12-year period for Cbl deficiency in a primary care setting who had serum Cbl values ⩾400pg/ml (n = 170).

Results

When no oxidant risks were present, older subjects (⩾70 years) had higher metabolite values than younger individuals (< 70 years). MMA values were even higher in the elderly when one oxidant risk was present and in younger subjects when two or more oxidant risks were present. Even at Cbl levels ⩾800pg/ml, MMA values were increased in 73% of elderly subjects with at least one oxidant risk. HCys values were also higher in both age groups when at least two oxidant risks were present. Cyanocobalamin therapy decreased MMA and HCys values in 86 and 76% of subjects, respectively, with nonresponders more likely to have two or more oxidant risks.

Conclusion

Functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders marked by increased oxidative stress particularly in the elderly; it occurs even when Cbl levels are high and is not consistently corrected with high-dose cyanocobalamin therapy. Thus, current approaches to recognizing and managing this disorder may be inadequate.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: experience in NHANES [^1125bbUV]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

After adjustment for relevant demographic and lifestyle factors as well as existing comorbidity, low serum B12 concentrations were independently associated with a slight increase of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Elevated serum B12 was associated with a small increase in cardiovascular mortality only. High intake of vitamin B12 in the form of supplements was not associated with increased all-cause mortality, supporting its safe use. Vitamin B12 deficiency is prevalent, particularly among the elderly, and is associated with serious morbidity. The diagnosis of such deficiency is often elusive so that the use of B12 supplements has become widespread, because of its low cost and presumed safety. Recent reports based on associations have raised the specter that high B12 levels may be harmful and have discouraged B12 supplement use with potentially harmful consequences. The overall public health impact of our findings is to provide reassurance that high B12 levels per se are not a cause of higher mortality risk.

### Association of plasma concentration of vitamin B12 with all-cause mortality… [^113Ss1MJ]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Are plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 associated with risk of all-cause mortality among adults from the general population of the Netherlands. Findings In this population-based cohort study including 5571 adults, higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 were associated with a 25% increased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality per 1-SD increase. Meaning These findings suggest that higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 are associated with all-cause mortality, independent of traditional risk factors. Importance Higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 have been associated with mortality in elderly and hospitalized populations, including patients with chronic kidney disease, but the association of plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 with mortality in the general population remains unclear.

After adjustment for multiple clinical and laboratory variables, Cox regression analyses found a significant association between higher vitamin B12 plasma concentration level and increased risk of all-cause mortality. Participants within the highest quartile of vitamin B12 plasma concentrations were more likely to be older and have higher BMI and blood pressure. Additionally, those participants also had higher concentrations of TC and glucose and higher UAE rates. Family history of CKD, history of cancer or CVD, and educational levels were similar across the quartiles of vitamin B12 plasma concentrations. In a fully adjusted multivariable model, higher vitamin B12 plasma concentration remained positively associated with use of lipid-lowering medication, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = 0.
09.

In this prospective population-based cohort study, we investigated the associations of plasma concentration of vitamin B12 with all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics, such as older age, high blood pressure, reduced eGFR, and elevated UAE rate, as well as increased concentrations of liver enzymes, were positively associated with higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12, in agreement with findings from other studies. 3, 8, 11 While the cross-sectional associations as found in this study do not provide an insight for a particular cause of death, we observed that high circulating vitamin B12 plasma concentrations were associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

A woman in her 60s with a history of vitamin B12 deficiency treated with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin was attending a specialist clinic for the management of persisting breathlessness following a previous pulmonary embolism. She reported that a persistently elevated vitamin B12 had been identified several months previously, despite the withdrawal of replacement therapy, and that the cause could not be explained to her by her general practitioner. Recognition of the potentially serious implications of this finding led to the identification of a pancreatic tumour which, by the time of diagnosis, had become too advanced for active management. We describe the metabolism of vitamin B12 in the context of hypervitaminosis B12 as a reflection of elevated transcobalamin consequent to underlying disease and the need to identify promptly the underlying cause.

### Subclinical cobalamin deficiency [^116v4XQe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent developments and controversies in the diagnosis, consequences, and management of subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), which affects many elderly persons.

Recent Findings

Diagnosis of SCCD depends exclusively on biochemical tests whose individual limitations suggest that combinations of tests are needed, especially in epidemiologic research. The causes of SCCD are unknown in more than 60% of cases, which limits prognostic predictions and identification of health consequences. After years of varying, often inconclusive associations, new clinical trials suggest that homocysteine reduction by high doses of folic acid, cobalamin, and pyridoxine may reduce progression of structural brain changes and cognitive impairment, especially in predisposed individuals. The causative or contributory roles, if any, of SCCD itself in cognitive dysfunction require direct study. If the findings are confirmed, high-dose supplementation with three vitamins will probably be more effective than fortification of the diet.

Summary

The story of SCCD, which is severalfold times more common in the elderly than clinical cobalamin deficiency but also differs from it in arising only infrequently from severe malabsorption and thus being less likely to progress, continues to evolve. Preventive benefits need to be confirmed and expanded, and will require fuller understanding of SCCD pathophysiology, natural history, and health consequences.

### Association between serum vitamin B12 and risk of all-cause mortality in elderly adults: a prospective cohort study [^115VgHoe]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The precise underlying mechanisms of the association between elevated serum vitamin B12 and mortality have not been fully established, some explanations however have been proposed. Firstly, increased liver cell renewal and damage (caused by liver diseases) may disrupt its reabsorption by the liver (the biggest reservoir of vitamin B12 in the body), which alternatively increases its leakage from the liver. Second, upregulation of haptocorrin and transcobalamin synthesis or shifted binding affinity of transport proteins for vitamin B12, as consequences of chronic renal failure, hematological disorders or genetic polymorphism for encoding transcobalamin, can cause a high serum vitamin B12 status as well. Third, infectious diseases and cancers can also lead to the increase of serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Typically, the majority of the aforementioned diseases are more prevalent among older adults than younger ones. Therefore, increased concentration of serum vitamin B12 might be a proxy for an unhealthy status in elderly adults, which could be used as a predictor of mortality.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin Deficiency: importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^1137q35K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

Methods

A retrospective record-review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and concurrent measurement of MMA.

Results

When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < .01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

Conclusion

In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when 3 or more oxidant risks are present. Thus, defining a low serum cobalamin level to screen for cobalamin deficiency may be a "moving target" due to the variable presence and severity of often subtle, confounding clinical conditions in individual subjects.

### Early treatment causes clinicoradiological reversal of myelopathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency [^113h6vvr]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation with a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. As a result, many patients lack classic features of advanced severe deficiency. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in order to prevent the irreversible damage to the nervous system. We describe a 25-year-old man, who presented with predominant sensory symptoms without any signs on clinical evaluation. His serum vitamin B12 levels were low and neuroimaging revealed myelopathy. The patient was treated promptly with cyanocobalamin injections, which lead to a rapid resolution of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: experience in NHANES [^113WUykF]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The (epidemiologic) relationship of increased serum B12 concentrations and subsequent disease or mortality has been the topic of several papers (Additional file 6: Table 5), showing the putative prognostic significance of increased serum B12 concentrations in people who were acutely ill. Several studies reported that high serum B12 concentrations predicted mortality in alcoholic hepatitis, inpatients, and in those critically ill. In contrast, in patients with ischemic stroke, low serum B12 was associated with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores and higher mortality. Elevated serum B12 was associated with severity of disease in acute-on-chronic liver failure, interstitial renal disease, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver metastases and proved to be a marker of poor liver function, but not a predictor of mortality after admission to an intensive care unit. These data altogether suggest that serum B12 concentrations increase as a consequence of acute and chronic illness. Several hypotheses have been postulated regarding the mechanism behind this, including an upregulation of haptocorrin synthesis, an increased release of cellular cobalamin, for instance in liver disorders during hepatic cytolysis, or a reduction of cobalamin clearance by a diseased liver. The associations that have been reported by others between high serum B12 concentrations and morbidity or mortality and the proposed underlying mechanism of such associations are plausible, invoking, as they do, a primary disease process that leads to secondary elevation of circulating B12 concentrations, presumably through tissue release of vitamin B12. However, there is nothing in those reports that indicates causality in the direction of a priori raised serum B12 leading to increased mortality. While the findings in our study confirm the overall U-shaped association of serum B12 concentration with mortality, they lend no support to the suggestion that high serum B12 concentrations per se are harmful or detrimental.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

Conclusions

The studies included in this systematic review indicate that evidence of an association between a subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration and anaemia in older people is limited and inconclusive. If anything, given the high clinical relevance of our research question, we recommend more well-designed longitudinal observational studies, in younger age groups (60–85 years) especially, and intervention studies of appropriate size and duration with timely follow-up periods to determine whether a subnormal vitamin B12 is a risk factor for anaemia in older people.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112X7DjX]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

This study highlights the significant reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels among patients with T2DM receiving metformin therapy compared with those not on metformin. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was notably higher in the metformin‐treated group, with no clear correlation observed between deficiency and metformin dose or duration of diabetes. These findings emphasise the critical need for routine monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in patients undergoing metformin therapy to detect and manage deficiencies early. Furthermore, the study underlines the efficacy of metformin in improving glycaemic control, evidenced by significantly lower HbA1c levels in the metformin group. Future research should focus on prospective studies with larger cohorts to further understand the long‐term implications of metformin use on vitamin B12 levels and overall patient health.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^116ouNKL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of patients referred for plasma vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) measurement present with high Cbl levels, which have been reported in patients with different cancer types. However, the cancer risk among patients with newly diagnosed high Cbl levels has not been adequately examined.

Methods

We conducted this cohort study using population-based Danish medical registries. Patients referred for Cbl measurement with levels greater than the lower reference limit (≥ 200 pmol/L) were identified from the population of Northern Denmark during the period of 1998 to 2009 using a database of laboratory test results covering the entire population. Data on cancer incidence (follow-up 1998–2010), Cbl treatment, and prior diagnoses were obtained from medical registries. Patients receiving Cbl treatment were excluded. Cancer risks were calculated as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by plasma Cbl levels. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

We identified 333 667 persons without prevalent cancer and not receiving Cbl treatment. Six percent had Cbl levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). Cancer risk increased with higher Cbl levels and was highest during the first year of follow-up (Cbl 601–800 pmol/L: SIR = 3.44, 95% CI = 3.14 to 3.76; Cbl > 800 pmol/L: SIR = 6.27, 95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88; both P < .001). The risks were particularly elevated for hematological and smoking- and alcohol-related cancers for persons with high Cbl levels.

Conclusions

High Cbl levels were associated with the risk of subsequently diagnosed cancer, mostly within the first year of follow-up. This may have clinical implications for the interpretation of high Cbl levels.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^112C48BN]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Macro-bmasking B deficiency [^1146SX2v]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In many instances, high concentrations of serum B 12 are the consequence of the use of supplements containing a pharmacological concentration of B 12, or recent injections of hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin. Elevated serum B 12 can also be found in patients with hepatic disease, myeloproliferative disorders, as well as metastasised cancers. Macro-B 12 is also a cause of high serum B 12 concentrations. Age of the patient, history, physical examination and additional laboratory investigations ruled out the major reasons or disorders associated with high serum B 12 concentrations in this patient. Therefore, we specifically focused on demonstrating macro-B 12 as a cause for the laboratory findings. With this, we specifically wondered whether the earlier diagnosis of B 12 deficiency could be demonstrated, now that supplementation with B 12 had been withheld for more than 2 years.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^112cxq29]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The underlying pathogenesis leading to high Cbl levels is poorly elucidated, with a few exceptions. It is not thought to involve increased Cbl intake because intestinal absorption capacity is saturable and high physiological consumption does not increase plasma Cbl levels substantially. Only Cbl therapy in the form of injections or extremely high oral doses can produce high circulating levels, and in this study, patients treated with Cbl were excluded. We therefore conclude that the mechanisms resulting in high Cbl levels may be related to malignant pathogenesis. Our recent study showed that levels of the circulating Cbl binding protein haptocorrin were high in patients with high plasma Cbl levels. Moreover, cancer was associated with high Cbl and high haptocorrin levels. This protein originates from a variety of tissues, but its physiological function remains unknown. It is elevated in patients with some cancer types and has been suggested as a marker for disease progression. Thus, haptocorrin may be a candidate factor to include in future studies of the possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to high Cbl levels in cancer patients, in particular for the novel associations demonstrated in this study.

In conclusion, our study showed that high plasma Cbl levels increased the risk of subsequently diagnosed cancer, mostly within the first year of follow-up. However, this association was not present for all cancer types. Although our results may have clinical implications for interpreting high Cbl levels, further studies are warranted to examine the possible diagnostic value of high plasma Cbl levels.

A particular strength of our study is the good comparability of P-B12 measurements. Hence, misclassification of P-B12 levels due to changes in analytical methods is unlikely. Further, we included two different data sources to identify persons treated with high-dose B12 drugs. Although high-dose B12 is available over-the-counter, we consider it likely that patients with P-B12 measurements were prescribed B12 drugs if B12 deficiency was diagnosed. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis on non-reimbursed B12 prescriptions showed robust results. We observed a small difference between patients with low and normal P-B12 in the proportion of deaths during follow-up in the secondary B12-treatment cohort. This could introduce survivor bias. However, we consider the risk of selection bias due to loss to follow-up minimal since all Danish citizens are registered in the Danish Civil Registration System, including date of death or emigration, allowing for censoring in the Cox regression analysis. Another strength is the high positive predictive value of dementia (86%) and Alzheimer's disease (81%) in the DNPR, although less so for other dementia subtypes. The robustness of the results in subanalyses and sensitivity analyses also strengthens our findings. Although hydroxo-B12 is more readily converted to biologically important forms of B12 (methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin) than cyano-B12, our results did not show any specific benefit of any formulation.

In conclusion, these robust results in a large patient population suggest that B12 deficiency does not contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia types, and that high-dose B12 treatment does not prevent these diseases regardless of P-B12 or P-MMA levels. Our findings from hospital inpatients, hospital outpatients, and general practitioner patients are highly representative of all Danish patients. These findings have high external validity at least for high-income countries. They have public health implications for the assessment of dementia and imply that guidelines suggesting routine screening for B12 deficiency in patients with suspected dementia should be reconsidered.

### Subacute combined degeneration with high serum vitamin B12 level and abnormal vitamin B12 binding protein… [^1156SZDa]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency invariably has been associated with a low serum vitamin B12 level. We describe a young man who presented with a unique syndrome of subacute combined degeneration associated with high serum vitamin B12 level, low red blood cell vitamin B12 level, and an abnormal plasma vitamin B12-binding protein. Uptake of cobalamin by his leukocytes in vitro was inhibited by his own but not by normal control plasma. Intensive hydroxocobalamin treatment was associated with clinical and electrophysiologic recovery accompanied by normalization of mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell vitamin B12 level, plasma homocysteine, and urinary methylmalonic acid. The subacute combined degeneration was probably precipitated by treatment with folic acid as the significance of his high serum vitamin B12 level was not apparent when he first presented with megaloblastic anemia 3 years earlier.

To our knowledge, this is the first example of neurologic disease associated with high serum vitamin B12 level and provides further evidence that sometimes a serum vitamin B12 level may not be a reliable guide to vitamin B12 deficiency.

Risk Factors for Folate Deficiency

Low folate levels usually occur in the context of a restricted diet, bariatric surgery, or malabsorption. Increased cell turnover such as pregnancy, severe eczema, chronic hemolysis, or exfoliative skin disease can contribute as well. Folate losses can occur with chronic hemodialysis or external biliary drainage.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency

Evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often occurs simultaneously. A complete evaluation for deficiency would evaluate vitamin B12, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine levels. Anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies should be considered to evaluate for pernicious anemia. Patients on chronic dialysis should have RBC folate levels evaluated rather than serum folate. Homocysteine levels are increased in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies however MMA is only elevated in B12 deficiency. Of note, although elevated homocysteine is associated with increased thrombosis, folic acid supplementation has not been showed to reduce the risk of such events.

A vitamin B12 value < 200pg/ml is indicative of deficiency. Vitamin B12 levels 200-300pg/ml and folate levels between 2-4ng/mL are considered borderline and may warrant further investigation. Vitamin B12 levels may be normal in those with nitrous oxide overuse as the underlying etiology is inactivation rather than deficiency. However homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated.

Vitamin B12 repletion should factor the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. Intramuscular route is preferred in patients with malabsorption or severe hematologic or neurologic symptoms. Initial dose can range from 1000mcg of intramuscular cyanocobalamin one to three times a week for 4 weeks or once daily for the first week followed by once a week doses for 4 weeks. Once symptoms improve, patients can be maintained on intramuscular preparation of 1000mcg once a month. Oral supplementation of 1000mcg can be used in those with milder symptoms and an intact gastrointestinal tract. A supratherapeutic oral dose has been used to promote passive absorption, bypassing the active transport mediated by intrinsic factor, in those with malabsorption who are unable to take intramuscular injections.

Folate repletion can start at 1 to 5mg a day until anemia improves followed by maintenance dose of 400mcg if the reason for deficiency persists. Vitamin B12 levels should be closely monitored as prolonged high dose folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but worsen an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to neurologic damage.

### Association between serum vitamin B12 and risk of all-cause mortality in elderly adults: a prospective cohort study [^115uvFQv]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As aging, the elderly population (aged more than 65 years) is expected to increase to more than 1.5 billion around the world by 2050. The estimated number in China will be 400 million, 150 million of whom will be over 80 years. China will encounter formidable medical challenges brought about by aging.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is an essential hydro-soluble micronutrient to maintain health, which can be obtained from the diet (e.g. meat, eggs, and dairy products), supplements and intramuscular injections. It serves as a coenzyme for two metabolic enzymes: methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Inactivity of the methionine synthase enzyme could lead to the reduction in methylation reaction and accumulation of homocysteine concentrations in the tissues and serum, while loss of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity could induce the increase of serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid. Previous studies have shown that abnormal concentrations of vitamin B12 may be associated with various physiological dysfunctions or diseases. Its deficiency can lead to clinical symptoms such as macrocytic anemia and dementia, which commonly occur among elderly adults. Multiple causes of low/deficient vitamin B12 status have been proposed, including malabsorption due to gastrointestinal dysfunctions (e.g. atrophic gastritis, coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, or gastric/intestinal resection), inadequate dietary intake (e.g. low dietary intake or vegetarianism), alcohol abuse, or medication use (e.g. metformin, proton-pump inhibitors or H2-receptor antagonists). High concentration of vitamin B12 may be caused by liver or renal dysfunction, which was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancers. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that either low or high concentration of vitamin B12 is associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality in elderly adults.

### Cyanocobalamin (Nascobal) [^115XbcqA]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Vitamin B12can be converted to coenzyme B12in tissues, and as such is essential for conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of coenzyme B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from its inactive storage form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and a functional folate deficiency occurs. Vitamin B12also may be involved in maintaining sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced form required by many SH-activated enzyme systems. Through these reactions, vitamin B12is associated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Parenteral (intramuscular) administration of vitamin B12completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and GI symptoms of vitamin B12deficiency; the degree of improvement in neurologic symptoms depends on the duration and severity of the lesions, although progression of the lesions is immediately arrested. In pernicious anemia patients, once weekly intranasal dosing with 500 mcg B12gel resulted in a consistent increase in pre-dose serum B12levels during one month of treatment (p < 0.003) above that seen one month after 100 mcg intramuscular dose (Figure 2).

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine [^112WMVAg]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Three topics affecting cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine that have generated interest, activity, and advances in recent years are discussed. These are: (I). the application of an expanded variety of tools to the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency, and how these affect and are affected by our current understanding of deficiency; (II). the nature of the interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease, and how the relationship is affected by vitamins; and (III). the improved understanding of relevant genetic disorders and common genetic polymorphisms, and how these interact with environmental influences. The diagnostic approach to cobalamin deficiency now allows better diagnosis of difficult and atypical cases and more confident rejection of the diagnosis when deficiency does not exist. However, the process has also become a complex and sometimes vexing undertaking. Part of the difficulty derives from the lack of a diagnostic gold standard among the many available tests, part from the overwhelming numerical preponderance of patients with subclinical deficiency (in which isolated biochemical findings exist without clinical signs or symptoms) among the cobalamin deficiency states, and part from the decreased availability of reliable tests to identify the causes of a patient's cobalamin deficiency and thus a growing deemphasis of that important part of the diagnostic process. In Section I, Dr. Carmel discusses the tests, the diagnostic issues, and possible approaches to the clinical evaluation. It is suggested no single algorithm fits all cases, some of which require more biochemical proof than others, and that differentiating between subclinical and clinical deficiency, despite their overlap, may be a helpful and practical point of departure in the evaluation of patients encountered in clinical practice. The arguments for and against a suggested expansion of the cobalamin reference range are also weighed. The epidemiologic data suggest that homocysteine elevation is a risk factor for vascular and thrombotic disease. In Section II, Dr. Green notes that the interactions of metabolism and clinical risk are not well understood and a causative relationship remains unproven despite new reports that lowering homocysteine levels may reduce vascular complications. Genetic and acquired influences may interact in important ways that are still being sorted out. The use of vitamins, especially folate, often reduces homocysteine levels but also carries potential disadvantages and even risks. Folate fortification of the diet and supplement use have also markedly reduced the frequency of folate deficiency, and cobalamin deficiency is now the more common deficiency state, especially among the elderly. Although genetic disorders are rare, they illuminate important metabolic mechanisms and pose diagnostic challenges, especially when clinical presentation occurs later in life. In Section III, Drs. Rosenblatt and Watkins use selected disorders to illustrate the subject. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, a hereditary disorder of cobalamin absorption at the ileal level, demonstrates genetic heterogeneity. Finnish patients show mutation of the gene for cubilin, the multiligand receptor for intrinsic factor. Surprisingly, Norwegian and other patients have been found recently to have mutations of the AMN (amnionless) gene, mutations that are lethal in mice at the embryonic stage. Two disorders of cobalamin metabolism, cblG and cblE, are now known to arise from mutations of the methionine synthase and methionine synthase reductase genes, respectively. These disorders feature megaloblastic anemia and neurologic manifestations. The folate disorder selected for illustration, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, paradoxically causes neurological problems but no megaloblastic anemia. This rare deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate metabolism. It is distinct from the very common MTHFR gene polymorphisms, mutations that cause mild to moderate reductions in MTHFR activity but no direct clinical manifestations. The MTHFR polymTHFR polymorphisms, especially the 677C→ T mutation, may contribute to vascular and birth defect risks, while reducing the risk of certain malignancies, such as colon cancer. These polymorphisms and those of genes for other enzymes and proteins related to cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine metabolism may be important role players in frequent interactions between genes and the environment.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: experience in NHANES [^115m2U4e]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

An important question, which cannot be answered with the current dataset, is whether and why many NHANES participants might have taken extra vitamin B12-containing supplements. Several participants took high doses of vitamin B12, in the range of 100 to 6000 mcg per day, while the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.4 mcg/day. For some, this might have been a treatment of demonstrated vitamin B12 deficiency or additional nutrient supplementation in the case of vegetarians, for others, such supplement use was either self-driven or by the recommendation of a health care provider. We clearly showed that the use of vitamin B12-containing supplements has increased during the more recent NHANES surveys and was significantly higher in participants with hypertension, dyslipidemia, CVD, and an earlier diagnosis of cancer. The association between elevated serum B12 and cardiovascular mortality, together with the absence of any association between high B12 supplement intake and mortality likely indicates "reverse causality". The increased use of vitamin B12-containing supplements by people with a chronic (cardiovascular) condition supports this conclusion, as well as the growing body of literature that serum B12 concentrations increase in states of inflammation. However, there are several other factors which by themselves may negatively influence long-term morbidity and mortality, and are associated with higher serum B12 concentrations, for instance, high consumption of red meat. A higher intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat may be associated with a small increased risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality. In the dataset, we observed several individuals with markedly elevated serum B12 concentrations which were not explained by oral supplement use or registered cobalamin-containing prescription medication. This could suggest "hidden" or non-reported use of such preparations or injectable use of vitamin B12 (personal communication prof. R.K. Bailey), but it may also indicate other factors which may lead to artificially elevated serum B12 concentrations such as recent infection, or the existence of circulating B12 immune complexes.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^115yrPyP]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Epidemiological studies report an independent, triangular association between MTHFR genotype, high tHcy and increased risk of stroke. RCTs show that B vitamin supplementation (vitamin B 9 (folic acid), vitamin B 12 and vitamin B6) lowers tHcy by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% compared with placebo.

Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy (and hence low B 12), high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy.

For patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the underlying cause is uncertain (ie, cryptogenic) after standard evaluation, it is recommended that tHcy be measured as part of the advanced evaluation.

If tHcy is raised, potential cause(s) of the hyperhomocysteinaemia (box 1) should be sought from the clinical assessment and measurement of renal function, thyroid function, glycated haemoglobin and holotranscobalamin or methylmalonic acid in the blood, and treated if possible.

If the cause of the hyperhomocysteinaemia remains unexplained and persistent, measurement of possible genetic determinants (eg, MTHFR) is indicated and daily supplementation with 0.5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B 12 is recommended. This combination would be expected to reduce tHcy by about a quarter to a third (eg, from about 12 umol/L to 8–9 umol/L). While vitamin B 12 can be administered as cyanocobalamin in patients with normal renal function, it is recommended that vitamin B 12 be administered as methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.

Any future trials of B vitamins for stroke prevention in regions without folic acid fortification should endeavour to determine whether the relative effects of B vitamin supplementation in reducing stroke risk are consistent throughout the range of baseline tHcy concentrations, or whether there is a threshold tHcy level below which B vitamins become ineffective (eg, as also for blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering).

What you need to know

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of results of blood tests assessing cobalamin (B 12) status because there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency
Neurological symptoms resulting from B 12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely
Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement, neither is titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment
Self-administration of intramuscular B 12 injections can lead to greater patient satisfaction and better health outcomes

### Cyanocobalamin [^1126iHxg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Does vitamin B12 influence clinical pregnancy outcome in the follicular-phase GnRH agonist protocol? [^1129QFPW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence highlights the direct impact of vitamin B12 on ovarian function and pregnancy success. Vitamin B12 deficiency disrupts the methionine cycle, inducing hyperhomocysteinemia — a condition linked to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in granulosa cells. Elevated homocysteine levels impair oocyte maturation, reduce embryo quality, and compromise trophoblast invasion during placentation, ultimately lowering clinical pregnancy rates. Notably, Boxmeer found that women with follicular fluid vitamin B12 concentrations > 500 pg/mL had a 2.3-fold higher likelihood of producing high-quality embryos compared to those with levels < 300 pg/mL. This suggests that vitamin B12 status may directly influence oocyte developmental competence, potentially through mechanisms involving epigenetic modulation and reduced oxidative stress in the ovarian follicle microenvironment. Gaskins reported that women with serum vitamin B12 levels > 701 pg/mL had a 2.04-fold higher probability of live birth after ART compared to those with levels < 439 pg/mL, underscoring a dose-dependent relationship. This dose-dependent relationship underscores the clinical significance of adequate B12 status for reproductive success, likely through ensuring optimal one-carbon metabolism flux necessary for embryonic development and implantation.

Few studies have addressed whether vitamin B12 influences clinical pregnancy rates in patients undergoing the follicular-phase gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol — if any exist. The present study therefore investigated the association between serum vitamin B12 concentrations and clinical pregnancy outcomes in women receiving in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Notably, we also explored potential threshold effects of serum vitamin B12 levels, with the aim of providing evidence to guide the development of personalized vitamin B12 supplementation strategies for this specific patient cohort.

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^1167GKyB]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Cbl levels may occur in acute leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases such as polycythemia vera, lymphoproliferative disorders, and multiple myeloma. The increased serum Cbl in hematological conditions is thought to be associated with an increased release of haptocorrin from proliferating leukocytes. Notably, our study identified children with diagnoses such as rhabdomyosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell lymphoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia among those presenting with elevated serum Cbl levels. The identification of five newly diagnosed malignancies among patients presenting with elevated serum Cbl levels is of particular interest. While this number may seem small relative to the overall study population, the fact that elevated Cbl levels were most commonly observed in patients diagnosed with leukemia and solid tumors supports a potential association between elevated Cbl levels and underlying malignancies. In the literature, leukemia has been reported to develop in 2 of 40 pediatric patients with elevated serum Cbl levels. This proportion is substantially higher than the reported annual incidence of new leukemia cases in children, approximately 4 per 100,000. In our study, the incidence of newly diagnosed malignancies (1.29%) also appears elevated compared to the general population. However, given that our institution is a tertiary referral center and the retrospective design of the study, it cannot be definitively concluded whether this difference reflects a true increase in risk. Additionally, patients with chronic diseases exhibited higher serum Cbl levels, which also declined more slowly during follow-up compared to patients without chronic diseases. While vitamin B12 supplementation may partly explain elevated levels, approximately half of the chronic disease patients in our study did not receive supplementation, suggesting that intrinsic physiological mechanisms may be responsible. Given the limited clinical manifestations of hematological disorders in pediatric populations, careful monitoring of children with elevated serum Cbl levels may be warranted to identify potential hematological diseases in their early stages.

WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

Reliable assessment methods — vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency and parenteral nutrition: Serum B12 interpretation is limited because plasma or serum values can be normal despite tissue deficiency and, in parenteral patients receiving daily B12 infusions, serum B12 levels are hard to interpret. For adults, the lower limit is 120–180 pmol/L or 170–250 pg/mL, with normal serum values 300–900 pg/mL. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) is the most sensitive and specific test; in established B12 deficiency or inadequate supplementation, MMA rises in 95%, whereas serum B12 is low (< 200 pg/mL) in only 69%. Elevated homocysteine and the FIGLU test occur in both B12 and folic acid deficiency and are not as specific as MMA for pinpointing B12 depletion.

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^115k2sEG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

USG is one of the most frequently utilized imaging methods in the clinical evaluation of liver and kidney diseases. The literature frequently highlights the association between elevated serum Cbl levels and liver and kidney disorders. In our study, USG findings from more than half of the group were analyzed, revealing that the most commonly observed pathological findings included fatty liver, hepatosplenomegaly, and increased renal echogenicity. These pathological features predominantly indicate liver or kidney disease, thereby reinforcing the association between elevated serum Cbl levels and these disorders, as reported in the literature. The primary cause of elevated serum Cbl levels in kidney disease is believed to be related to decreased renal clearance, while in liver diseases, an increased release from damaged hepatocytes and reduced hepatic uptake are considered the primary mechanisms. Although it is presumed that Cbl supplementation administered to patients with chronic diseases contributes to elevated serum Cbl levels, our study observed that approximately half of the patients with chronic diseases did not receive any supportive therapy, suggesting that the observed elevation may primarily result from inherent physiological mechanisms.

### B vitamins in stroke prevention: time to reconsider [^1158dRUR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

B vitamin therapy lowers plasma total homocysteine concentrations, and might be a beneficial intervention for stroke prevention; however, cyanocobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) can accelerate decline in renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with impaired renal function. Although early trials did not show benefit in reduction of stroke, these results might have been due to harm in participants with impaired renal function. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, cyanocobalamin is harmful, whereas B vitamins appear to reduce cardiovascular events in study participants with normal renal function. Our meta-analysis of individual patient data from two large trials of B vitamin therapy (VISP and VITATOPS) indicates that patients with impaired renal function who are exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin do not benefit from therapy with B vitamins for the prevention of stroke (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.84–1.27), however, patients with normal renal function who are not exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin benefit significantly from this treatment (0.78, 0.67–0.90; interaction p = 0.03). The potential benefits of B vitamin therapy with folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin, instead of cyanocobalamin, to lower homocysteine concentrations in people at high risk of stroke warrant further investigation.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cyanocobalamin IN (also known as Nascobal, B-12):
- **Anaphylaxis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. Consider administering an intradermal test if patients are to start intranasal cyanocobalamin before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally.
- **Hypokalemia, thrombocytosis**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Oral or intramuscular vitamin B12? [^116keXef]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, becoming more so with age, and estimates of its population prevalence have ranged from 1.5% to 15%. If untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and irreversible neurological complications. In the UK, the usual treatment is regular intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. High-dose oral vitamin B(12) replacement is standard practice in some other countries and less costly. Here we review issues around adopting an oral vitamin B(12) replacement regimen more widely in the UK.

### Laboratory testing for cobalamin deficiency in megaloblastic anemia [^115oLWwy]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia in Western populations. Laboratory evaluation of megaloblastic anemia frequently includes the assessment of patient cobalamin and folate status. Current total serum cobalamin measurements are performed in the clinical laboratory with competitive binding luminescence assays, whose results may not always accurately reflect actual cobalamin stores. Surrogate markers of cobalamin deficiency such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine have been utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, the specificity of these tests by themselves is rather low. Measurement of the biologically active fraction of cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, has been proposed as a replacement for current total cobalamin assays. Although holotranscobalamin measurements appear to have slighter better sensitivity, the specificity of this assay remains to be determined. The relative merits and demerits of commonly available methods to assess cobalamin deficiency in patients with suspected megaloblastic anemia are discussed.

### Functional vitamin B12 deficiency [^114X3ZYC]. Practical Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a case of functional vitamin B12 deficiency where the repeated measurement of a serum B12 level within the normal range led to delay in the diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and possibly permanent neurological damage as a result. Failure of intracellular transport of B12 by transcobalamin-2 can lead to functional B12 deficiency but with apparently normal serum levels, and is suggested by raised levels of either serum methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, associated with low levels of transcobalamin-2. Such patients may respond to repeated high-dose injections of B12.

WARNING/PRECAUTIONS

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.

### Vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels predict different outcomes in early Parkinson's disease [^116TNUAC]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In moderately advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), low serum vitamin B12 levels are common and are associated with neuropathy and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about B12 in early PD.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of low vitamin B12 status in early PD and whether it is associated with clinical progression.

Methods

We measured vitamin B12 and other B12 status determinants (methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and holotranscobalamin) in 680 baseline and 456 follow-up serum samples collected from DATATOP participants with early, untreated PD. Borderline low B12 status was defined as serum B12 < 184pmol/L (250pg/mL), and elevated homocysteine was defined as > 15µmol/L. Outcomes included the UPDRS, ambulatory capacity score (sum of UPDRS items 13–15, 29&30), and MMSE, calculated as annualized rates of change.

Results

At baseline, 13% had borderline low B12 levels, 7% had elevated homocysteine, whereas 2% had both. Elevated homocysteine at baseline was associated with worse scores on the baseline MMSE. Analysis of study outcomes showed that compared with the other tertiles, participants in the low B12 tertile (< 234pmol/L; 317pg/mL) developed greater morbidity as assessed by greater annualized worsening of the ambulatory capacity score. Elevated homocysteine was associated with greater annualized decline in MMSE (-1.96 vs. 0.06; P = 0001). Blood count indices were not associated with B12 or homocysteine status.

Conclusions

In this study of early PD, low B12 status was common. Low B12 at baseline predicted greater worsening of mobility whereas elevated homocysteine predicted greater cognitive decline. Given that low B12 and elevated homocysteine can improve with vitamin supplementation, future studies should test whether prevention or early correction of these nutritionally modifiable conditions slows development of disability. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^113RJ78E]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Our study also was able to examine clinical routine practice. We showed that approximately 15% of the population in Northern Denmark has had a plasma Cbl measurement during the study period and that these measurements show Cbl levels within or above the reference range. This suggests that plasma Cbl measurements are used routinely and frequently to screen for Cbl deficiency in the presence of symptoms or other risks. Although our study cannot directly assess use of high Cbl levels as a nonspecific marker of cancer, our findings may be relevant to the clinical interpretation of such high levels.

A number of different diseases have been suggested as causing high Cbl levels, but common to most of them is that the pathogenesis involving elevated Cbl levels is not fully understood. In principle, some of these diseases might be responsible for the long-term associations observed in our study, thereby possibly confounding the associations between high Cbl levels and cancer. For example, the association between liver cancer and high Cbl levels could, in theory, be caused by nonmalignant liver disease underlying the liver cancer. However, when we stratified the analyses according to prior diseases, the results remained robust. This indicates that high Cbl levels could be a marker for cancer both in the short- and long-term, exceeding 5 years for hematological cancers (, available online). Such persistent long-term associations are more likely to be affected by unrecorded confounders, such as lifestyle factors. Although smoking is not associated with disruptions in Cbl status, alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease have previously been linked to high Cbl levels. This could influence the long-term risk that we observed for some cancers, such as liver cancer, whereas the long-term association with hematological cancers is more peculiar.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^115YoiGv]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Like vitamin B 12 deficiency, the MTHFR 677TT genotype is also associated with elevated tHcy concentrations. A substudy of the CSPPT recently reported an interactive effect of the MTHFR C677T gene variant and serum folate levels on the serum tHcy-lowering response to long-term folic acid supplementation. As in previous studies, the MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with elevated tHcy levels, but it was mainly in participants with low folate intake and low serum folate concentrations. The study reported that the adverse effects of the TT genotype on tHcy levels were ameliorated by raising serum folate levels above the threshold (15 ng/mg or 34 nmol/L) with folic acid supplementation. The data also indicated that individuals with the TT genotype and low serum folate, by having the highest levels of tHcy, are also the subgroup likely to benefit most from folic acid therapy, particularly when serum folate levels can increase to the reported threshold of > 34 nmol/L. The authors suggested that adequate nutrition (ie, folate intake) may be able to counteract genetic susceptibility for hyperhomocysteinaemia.

Cyanocobalamin toxicity in patients with impaired renal function

A meta-analysis of individual patient data from two large trials of B vitamin supplementation in patients with prior stroke and TIA (Vitamins Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP)and VITAmins TO Prevent Stroke (VITATOPS)) and tabulated data from other trials found that patients with impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2) who were allocated to high-dose cyanocobalamin (at least 0.4 mg daily) did not benefit from therapy with B vitamins for the prevention of stroke (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27), whereas patients with normal renal function who were not exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin (ie, no cyanocobalamin or 0.02 mg cyanocobalamin daily) did benefit significantly from B vitamin supplementation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; interaction p = 0.03) (table 1).

### Effects of hydroxocobalamin on carboxyhemoglobin measured under physiologic and pathologic conditions [^111nyJy4]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Pre-hospital administration of hydroxocobalamin (B12a) is used for empiric treatment of cyanide poisoning because cyanide poisoning is difficult to identify and requires immediate treatment. B12a interferes with the accuracy of several blood laboratory tests. This study aimed to explore how B12a affects carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurements in human blood at both physiologic and pathologic COHb levels.

Methods

Several clinically relevant concentrations of B12a were added to human blood samples containing physiologic (∼ 3%) and pathologic (30% and 50%) COHb levels. We then measured the COHb levels of the samples using two different co-oximeters, the Radiometer ABL 700 and the Rapidpoint 500, and compared to their actual baseline COHb levels.

Results

B12a had minimal effects on the COHb measured at both physiologic and pathologic levels when measured on the Radiometer. In contrast, the Rapidpoint B12a caused a dose-dependent decrease in the COHb measured, especially of pathologic COHb levels (∼ 30 and 50%).

Conclusion

The magnitude of B12a interference on measured COHb is dependent upon the specific co-oximeter used, the actual COHb level and the serum B12a concentration. These errors may potentially influence clinical decision making and thus affect patient outcomes. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring COHb levels on blood samples collected prior to B12a administration.
