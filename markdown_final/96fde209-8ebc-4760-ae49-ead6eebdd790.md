## Question

A 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis and recurrent urinary tract infections comes to the emergency department because of flank pain and fever. Her temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F). Examination shows left-sided costovertebral angle tenderness. She is admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous vancomycin. Three days later, her symptoms have not improved. Urine culture shows growth of Enterococcus faecalis. Which of the following best describes the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in this patient?
A. Production of beta-lactamase
B. Alteration of penicillin-binding proteins
C. Alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis
D. Alteration of ribosomal targets

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains why Enterococcus faecalis is resistant to vancomycin in a patient with multiple sclerosis and recurrent urinary tract infections who has not improved after vancomycin therapy, with answer choices including beta-lactamase production, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis, and alteration of ribosomal targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about vancomycin's mechanism of action and why enterococci are intrinsically tolerant. Then, I should verify the canonical resistance mechanisms in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), especially VanA/VanB and their biochemical consequences. Next, I will examine each distractor and check whether it plausibly explains vancomycin nonresponse. Finally, I will align the correct mechanism with the clinical scenario and confirm the answer choice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Vancomycin binds the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of peptidoglycan precursors, thereby blocking peptidoglycan polymerization and cell wall synthesis. This is the target it must engage to exert bactericidal activity, so any change that reduces binding at that site would confer resistance [^115KariH] [^116uWLfu].

> Now, I need to check the canonical VRE resistance mechanisms. High-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci is most commonly mediated by vanA or vanB operons, which encode enzymes that replace the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus with D-Ala-D-lactate, markedly reducing vancomycin binding affinity and rendering the drug ineffective. This is a well-established alteration of peptidoglycan precursor structure rather than a change in a protein target like PBPs or ribosomes [^115KariH] [^116uWLfu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the distractors. Beta-lactamase production would explain resistance to beta-lactams, not to vancomycin, and although rare E. faecalis strains can produce beta-lactamase, this does not affect glycopeptide activity; vancomycin's target is not a beta-lactamase substrate, so this cannot explain vancomycin failure [^112hXKbw]. Alteration of penicillin-binding proteins explains beta-lactam resistance in organisms like MRSA and some enterococci, but again, vancomycin does not act via PBPs, so PBP changes would not explain vancomycin nonresponse [^115KariH]. Alteration of ribosomal targets explains resistance to agents like linezolid or macrolides, not vancomycin, so that would be mechanistically mismatched here as well [^116W7iTB].

> Wait, let me verify the phrasing of the correct option. Option C is described as "alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis", which precisely captures the biochemical consequence of VanA/VanB: the enzymes VanH, VanA, and VanX redirect peptidoglycan precursor synthesis to D-Ala-D-lactate, thereby altering peptidoglycan synthesis and preventing vancomycin binding. This is the direct mechanistic explanation for vancomycin resistance in VRE [^116uWLfu] [^115KariH].

> I should confirm the clinical context alignment. The patient's failure of vancomycin after several days is consistent with VRE due to D-Ala-D-lactate–mediated resistance, and the most likely mechanism in E. faecalis VRE remains the acquisition of vanA/vanB with subsequent peptidoglycan precursor modification; this mechanistic match supports option C as the best answer [^115KariH] [^116uWLfu].

> Final answer: C. Alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis [^116uWLfu] [^115KariH].

---

The most likely mechanism of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis is **alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis** [^115KariH] via the vanA/vanB operons, which replace D-Ala-D-Ala with D-Ala-D-Lac, reducing vancomycin binding and causing treatment failure [^115KariH]. Vancomycin is inappropriate for enterococcal UTIs; **ampicillin is first-line** if susceptible, and for VRE, use linezolid or daptomycin [^113dQJ6a] [^112zPiC7].

## Mechanism of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis

Vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis is primarily mediated by **acquisition of vancomycin resistance genes**, particularly vanA and vanB, which alter peptidoglycan precursor synthesis [^115KariH]. These genes encode enzymes that replace the terminal D-alanine-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) moiety of peptidoglycan precursors with D-alanine-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac), significantly reducing vancomycin binding affinity and resulting in high-level resistance [^115KariH].

---

## Clinical implications of vancomycin resistance

Vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Treatment failure**: Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^notfound].

- **Limited therapeutic options**: Resistance to vancomycin severely restricts available treatment options, necessitating the use of alternative antibiotics such as linezolid or daptomycin [^114QR2Zr].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are associated with prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs [^113bNTWa].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Given the emergence of vancomycin resistance, **alternative antibiotic therapies** are recommended:

| **Antibiotic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Linezolid | Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit | - Bacteriostatic <br/> - Potential for myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome [^1177CRNL] |
| Daptomycin | - Binds to bacterial cell membrane <br/> - Causing rapid depolarization and cell death | - Bactericidal <br/> - Potential for muscle toxicity [^112PuFM5] |
| Tigecycline | Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit | - Broad-spectrum activity <br/> - Limited clinical data for enterococcal infections [^111pWX1m] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in this patient is **alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis** [^115KariH], specifically the replacement of D-Ala-D-Ala with D-Ala-D-Lac mediated by vanA/vanB genes, resulting in vancomycin resistance [^115KariH]. This mechanism explains the patient's lack of response to vancomycin therapy and highlights the importance of appropriate antibiotic selection based on culture and susceptibility results [^116VWESp].

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^113eFhMJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in wounds yet little is known about its pathogenic mechanisms in this setting. Here, we used a mouse wound excisional model to characterize the infection dynamics of E faecalis and show that infected wounds result in 2 different states depending on the initial inoculum. Low-dose inocula were associated with short-term, low-titer colonization whereas high-dose inocula were associated with acute bacterial replication and long-term persistence. High-dose infection and persistence were also associated with immune cell infiltration, despite suppression of some inflammatory cytokines and delayed wound healing. During high-dose infection, the multiple peptide resistance factor, which is involved in resisting immune clearance, contributes to E faecalis fitness. These results comprehensively describe a mouse model for investigating E faecalis wound infection determinants, and suggest that both immune modulation and resistance contribute to persistent, nonhealing wounds.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^1132Hn8u]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Results

During the 51-month study period, the incidence of VRE increased from 34 to 88 cases per 10,000 admissions. VRE were isolated in clinical cultures from 251 patients who fulfilled the study criteria (first isolation of VRE while hospitalized in our institution). The 251 diagnostic cultures were sent from 30 different nursing units. Twenty-eight percent of the case-patients were diagnosed during an ICU stay. No appropriate control patient could be matched for 18 cases. Thus, the study included 880 patients — 233 cases and 647 matched control patients. The average age was 62 years (range 17–105), and 46% of the patients were female. Patients were hospitalized for an average of 8.1 days before entry into the study. The likelihood of being cultured (between admission and 2 days before matching) for cases and controls had similar distribution of the likelihood of being cultured (median 0, 0; 75th percentile 0, 1; and 90th percentile 21, 24 cultures for controls and cases, respectively).

### Bacteriocin production facilitates nosocomial emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [^113n97ob]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Enterococcus faecium is a gastrointestinal tract commensal that can also cause serious infections, most commonly bloodstream and urinary tract infections, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. Hospitalized patients are often exposed to high levels of antibiotics, which decrease the diversity of commensals in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and facilitate the overgrowth of multidrug-resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) –. VREfm overgrowth within the intestinal tract predisposes patients to invasive bloodstream infections. Furthermore, increased VREfm GI tract burdens cause patients to shed VREfm into the environment, facilitating transmission to other patients mainly through the faecal–oral route –.

Whole-genome sequencing facilitates the surveillance and characterization of VREfm population structure and transmission dynamics within healthcare settings. Multilocus sequence typing allows tracking of VREfm lineages both within and between healthcare facilities and on both local and global scales –. Sequence types (STs) with similar genotypes, defined as having four or more identical loci, can be grouped into clonal complexes. VREfm lineages most often belong to clonal complex 17 (CC17), which phylogenetically resides within hospital-associated E. faecium clade A1. CC17 strains frequently encode antimicrobial resistance genes, mobile genetic elements and genes that enable the metabolism of amino sugars found on GI epithelia and mucin, probably contributing to the success of CC17 strains in healthcare settings –. This success is exemplified by CC17 lineages being identified as responsible for widespread outbreaks and increased rates of invasive infection. Although several previous studies have investigated VREfm population structure and dynamics within healthcare settings, we know little about the factors that drive the emergence and persistence of particular VREfm lineages in the hospital.

In this study, we characterized the population structure and dynamics of VREfm within a single hospital using whole-genome sequencing-based surveillance and functional characterization of genes associated with nosocomial emergence. We systematically collected 710 VREfm clinical isolates over a 6-year period and used both genomic analysis and phenotypic testing to investigate factors contributing to population shifts observed within the facility. In addition, we compared local findings with a global collection of 15,631 publicly available VREfm genomes isolated from human sources from 2002 to 2022. We found that a bacteriocin produced by emergent VREfm lineages provided a strong competitive advantage, highlighting an adaptive mechanism that probably contributes to lineage replacement of VREfm on both local and global scales.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: a road map on how to prevent the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance [^113Z55US]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Nosocomial acquisition of microorganisms resistant to multiple antibiotics represents a threat to patient safety. Here we review the mechanisms that have allowed highly resistant strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus to proliferate within our health-care institutions. These mechanisms indicate that decreasing the prevalence of resistant organisms requires active surveillance, adherence to vigorous isolation, hand hygiene and environmental decontamination measures, and effective antibiotic stewardship. We suggest how to tailor such a complex, multidisciplinary program to the needs of a particular health-care setting so as to maximize cost-effectiveness.

### Impact of antibiotic resistance on clinical outcomes and the cost of care [^113bNTWa]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant organisms are common in intensive care unit infection and can be either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. A number of studies have evaluated whether these organisms can lead to excess morbidity, mortality, or cost. In general, the studies are confounded by a number of methodologic issues, including the selection of an appropriate control population. Cases and controls must be appropriately matched for the presence of infection, the presence of infection with similar organisms (but ones that are either antibiotic-sensitive or -resistant), and severity of illness. In addition, studies must account for the therapies given to patients who are infected with resistant organisms because resistance is an important risk factor for inadequate empirical therapy, and such therapy is itself a potent determinant of a number of adverse outcomes, including mortality. To date, the data with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus are inconsistent with regard to the effect on mortality rates, although infection with both organisms can lead to excess length of stay and increased cost of care. When studies have been adequately controlled and powered, infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus has had more of an effect on the mortality rate than infection with antibiotic-sensitive enterococci. Infection with resistant Gram-negatives also has adverse impact on outcome, with excess mortality being seen in patient groups infected with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If we are to minimize the effect of resistance on medical outcomes and cost, it will be necessary to have a current knowledge of each intensive care unit's pathogens and susceptibility patterns, so that empirical therapy will have a good likelihood of being effective. In addition, new therapeutic agents may improve on the efficacy of older agents and could reduce cost if they allow for some patients to leave the hospital and to finish therapy with an oral formulation of a highly bioavailable agent.

### Outcomes for and risk factors associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients [^1168zzxn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a major cause of nosocomial infection. We sought to compare vancomycin-resistant (VR) Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia and VR Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients with respect to risk factors, clinical presentation, microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes.

Methods

We identified 210 cancer patients with VRE bacteremia who had been treated between January 1996 and December 2004; 16 of these 210 had VR E. faecalis bacteremia and were matched with 32 patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia and 32 control patients. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted.

Results

Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with VR E. faecalis bacteremia, VR E. faecium bacteremia was associated with a worse clinical response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.07–0.98]; p = 0.046) and a higher overall mortality rate (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 1.9–35.3]; p = 0.004), but the VRE-related mortality rate did not show a statistically significant difference (OR, 6.8 [95% CI, 0.7–61.8]; p = 0.09). Compared with control patients, patients with VR E. faecalis bacteremia were more likely to have received an aminoglycoside in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.2–27.6]; p = 0.03), whereas patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia were more likely to have received a carbapenem in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (OR, 11.7 [95% CI, 3.6–38.6]; P < .001). In a multivariate model that compared patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia and control patients, predictors of mortality included acute renal failure on presentation (OR, 15.1 [95% CI, 2.3–99.2]; p = 0.004) and VR E. faecium bacteremia (OR, 11 [95% CI, 2.7–45.1]; P < .001). No difference in outcomes was found between patients with VR E. faecalis bacteremia and control patients.

Conclusions

VR E. faecium bacteremia in cancer patients was associated with a poorer outcome than was VR E. faecalis bacteremia. Recent receipt of carbapenem therapy was an independent risk factor for VR E. faecium bacteremia, and recent receipt of aminoglycoside therapy was independent risk factor for E. faecalis bacteremia.

### Outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a tertiary hospital: the lack of effect of measures directed mainly by surveillance cultures and differences in response between Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis [^112ZasEJ]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

To describe the effect of active surveillance to control vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) after an outbreak, 549 surveillance rectal cultures were performed in 308 patients (35% positive). An educational intervention to prevent transmission was implemented. Infection and colonization by VR- Enterococcus faecalis decreased, but Enterococcus faecium persisted despite control measures. Infections by VR-E faecalis fell to zero in 2008. We observed difficulties in controlling colonization with measures directed mainly by surveillance cultures and differences between responses of E faecium and E faecalis.

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^117UXbiE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, that are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. It is the purpose of this review to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections. While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high, and from a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin resistant-enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^1177bNGw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Serious infections owing to vancomycin-resistant enterococci have historically proven to be difficult clinical cases, requiring combination therapy and management of treatment-related toxicity. Despite the introduction of new antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci to the therapeutic armamentarium, significant challenges remain. An understanding of the factors driving the emergence of resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the dynamics of gastrointestinal colonization and microbiota-mediated colonization resistance, and the mechanisms of resistance to the currently available therapeutics will permit clinicians to be better prepared to tackle these challenging hospital-associated pathogens.

### Diversification and evolution of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during intestinal domination [^116RxDuE]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant(VRE) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. This is particularly true in immunocompromised patients, where the damage to the microbiota caused by antibiotics can lead to VRE domination of the intestine, increasing a patient's risk for bloodstream infection.

Statement 31

Antimicrobial resistance among enterococcal isolates (ampicillin, gentamcin or vancomycin resistance) is mostly found in nosocomial (postoperative or tertiary) peritonitis. In Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), treatment with linezolid (monomicrobial infection) or tigecycline (polymicrobial infection) is appropriate (Recommendation 1 B).

Among Gram-positive bacteria, Enterococci play a significant role in IAIs. Although they are found in community-acquired infections, they were far more prevalent in hospital-acquired infections. In the CIAOW Study, Enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were the most prevalent bacteria among all the aerobic Gram-positive bacteria isolated in the intra-operative samples, representing 15.9% of all aerobic isolates. Although Enterococci were also present in community-acquired infections, they were more prevalent in HA-IAIs (22.3% in HA-IAIs versus 13.9% in CA-IAIs). Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where Enterococci coverage should always be considered. Empirical coverage of Enterococci is not generally recommended for patients with CA-IAIs. The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Many factors can increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection. These include previous antibiotic therapy, prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, severe illness or underlying pathology, invasive procedures, gastrointestinal surgery, organ transplantation, and close proximity to other VRE-positive patients.

The majority of vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections have been attributed to E. faecium, though glycopeptide resistance occurs in E. faecalis and other Enterococcus spp. as well.

Options for treating vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections are linezolid or tigeciclyine.

### Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci [^116W7iTB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Enterococci are common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. Although > 40 enterococcus species exist, nosocomial infections are primarily caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococcal infections are the third most common cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs), and multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections have been associated with higher hospitalization costs and a higher number of related deaths.

Linezolid, 1 of the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobial drugs, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of 23S rRNA. In April 2000, linezolid was approved in the United States and has been heavily marketed to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. Although more expensive than vancomycin, linezolid does not require testing for adequate serum drug concentrations or dosing adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency, and it has been regarded by some healthcare providers as more effective than vancomycin in treating nosocomial pneumonia and MRSA skin and soft tissue infections. Most reports of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) have been individual cases or small case series or have specifically described linezolid-resistant and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (LRVRE). We describe a large hospital outbreak of LRE infections.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^113pY2Jf]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis — vancomycin-based recommendations: Vancomycin should be administered only if a patient is unable to tolerate penicillin or ampicillin (Class I; Level of Evidence B). It is reasonable that patients with NVE receive 6 weeks of vancomycin-gentamicin therapy and that patients with PVE receive at least 6 weeks of therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Patients with E faecalis IE caused by strains that are intrinsically resistant to penicillin should be treated with a combination of vancomycin plus gentamicin (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

### The woman with dysuria… [^1144uTY6]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Some patients experience the disruption of some of these defense mechanisms. The conditions that increase the incidence of disruptions are listed in. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections. Complicated urinary tract infections are defined as those occurring in patients with anatomically or functionally abnormal urinary tracts, or in patients who are immunocompromised or have iatrogenic infections. Clinical recognition of complicated urinary tract infections is important because these patients are more likely to harbor resistant organisms. Therapy consists of broader spectrum agents such as fluroquinolones. Cystitis should be treated for one week. Upper urinary tract infections should be treated for two weeks. A urine culture should be obtained to confirm sensitivity. A urine culture and sensitivity should be obtained when an upper urinary tract infection is suspected based on clinical symptoms or risk factors.

Table 5 lists the identifiable factors that increase a patient's risk for subclinical pyelonephritis. The clinician must suspect subclinical pyelonephritis in any patient with symptoms of cystitis who has one or more of the risk factors listed in Table 5. The physician should be aware that complicated urinary tract infections and subclinical pyelonephritis are not mutually exclusive and have overlapping risk factors. Patients with symptoms of cystitis and one or more risk factors for subclinical pyelonephritis should be treated for both conditions with empiric broader-spectrum antibiotics for two weeks. Diagnostic Evaluation Interstitial cystitis remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients present with dysuria, urgency and frequency. The majority of patients have dyspareunia, and about 20 percent of patients have gross hematuria.

Characteristic symptoms of interstitial cystitis are listed in. Treatment There is no known curative therapy for interstitial cystitis; consequently, efforts are directed at ameliorating symptoms and improving function. Patients usually begin with oral therapy and, if it is not successful, are changed to intravesical therapy. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is effective in some patients. Intravesical therapies include hydrodistention of the bladder during cystoscopic evaluation. This is believed to be therapeutic secondary to the ischemia produced to the submucosal nerve plexuses and stretch receptors. About 20 percent of patients report decreased pain and increased bladder capacity after this procedure, but unfortunately symptoms usually recur within three months.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^113aZRxG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study is its multicentric and exhaustive aspect: inclusion of most hospitals, including all referral centers, in a large area; and the pragmatic approach for evaluation of treatment efficacy considering the antibiotic regimen really received by the patient. The limitations of this study are mainly inherent to its retrospective design, leading to missing data, significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up, and impossibility to fully control confounding factors in treatment effects despite multivariate analysis. The low number of relapses and of patients treated with amoxicillin alone leads to a lack of power in the analysis of treatment efficacy. The definition of acute kidney failure did not allow a reliable assessment of this complication. Finally, we did not evaluate the role of serum concentrations of antibiotics, which could be interesting to better understand the mechanisms of relapse.

### Integration of vanHAX downstream of a ribosomal RNA operon restores vancomycin resistance in a susceptible Enterococcus faecium strain [^115KariH]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Enterococcus faecium is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract. However, it is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteriaemia, endocarditis and urinary tract infections in immunocompromised hosts. Genomic studies have revealed that the vast majority of clinical infections are caused by a phylogenetically defined cluster of E. faecium strains, which was termed clade A1. E. faecium infections are difficult to treat as they are often resistant to aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, β-lactam, and glycopeptide drugs.

Vancomycin is a bactericidal glycopeptide antibiotic that targets peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. Resistance to vancomycin is conferred by clusters of genes which replace the terminal D-alanyl D-alanine motif of the lipid II stem peptide with a D-alanyl D-lactate or D-alanyl D-serine motif, thereby greatly reducing the binding affinity of vancomycin. There are currently ten known gene clusters that confer resistance to vancomycin in E. faecium, but the vanA and vanB -type clusters are the most prevalent. Vancomycin resistance gene clusters are generally carried on mobile genetic elements, of which the transposon Tn 1546 and the integrative and conjugative element Tn 1549 encode vanA - and vanB- type resistance, respectively. These elements can be integrated into plasmids and chromosomes.

An increasing number of E. faecium strains are being identified that contain the gene clusters required for vancomycin resistance but are phenotypically susceptible –. These strains are known as vancomycin-variable E. faecium (VVE). The mechanisms which lead to the susceptibility of these isolates are varied. Full or partial deletion of genes within the vancomycin resistance gene cluster is common, including in the regulatory genes vanR - vanS, or the D-alanyl D-alanine dipeptidase gene vanX –, as well as deletions in promoter sites and integration of insertion sequence (IS) elements into the promoter regions of vancomycin resistance genes. Vancomycin-variable isolates are of particular concern in the treatment of patients as these isolates can rapidly revert to the resistant phenotype under vancomycin selection, which may, in turn, lead to treatment failure.

Here we investigate an outbreak of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium in a haematology ward within a UK hospital. Within the outbreak we identified a vancomycin-variable isolate that was able to rapidly revert to a vancomycin-resistant phenotype under low-level vancomycin selection and we uncovered both the cause of its susceptibility and the mechanism by which it could revert to a vancomycin resistant phenotype.

### Reference group choice and antibiotic resistance outcomes [^113bwhfr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Two types of cohort studies examining patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were contrasted, using different reference groups. Cases were compared to uninfected patients and patients infected with the corresponding, susceptible organism. VRE and MRSA were associated with adverse outcomes. The effect was greater when uninfected control patients were used.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^117BtCy7]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — the inoculum effect denotes reduced antimicrobial activity at high bacterial densities, where the effective minimum inhibitory concentration at the site of infection with bacterial densities of 10^8 to 10^11 colony-forming units per 1 g tissue can be much higher than with a standard inoculum of 10^5 colony-forming units per milliliter; β-lactams and glycopeptides are less active against highly dense bacterial populations, whereas fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are less affected; an inoculum effect also occurs with β-lactamase–susceptible β-lactams versus β-lactamase–producing bacteria (observed with enterococci, S aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli), and high inocula are more likely to harbor resistant subpopulations with reduced vancomycin activity at 10^8 colony-forming units per milliliter in an in vitro PD model.

Objective

To review the literature on the pharmacotherapy of bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search was performed for the period 1946 to May 2014 using the search terms Enterococcus, enterococci, vancomycin-resistant, VRE, bacteremia, and bloodstream infection. References were also identified from selected review articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language case series, cohort studies, and meta-analyses assessing the options in the pharmacotherapy of VRE BSIs in adult patients were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Studies were identified that utilized linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), and daptomycin. In all, 8 comparative retrospective cohort studies, 2 meta-analyses of daptomycin and linezolid, and 3 retrospective comparisons of linezolid and Q/D were included for review. Mortality associated with VRE BSIs was high across studies, and the ability to determine differences in outcomes between agents was confounded by the complex nature of the patients included. Two meta-analyses comparing daptomycin with linezolid for VRE BSIs found modest advantages for linezolid, but these conclusions may be hampered by heterogeneity within the included studies.

Conclusions

VRE BSIs remain a difficult-to-treat clinical situation. Differences in toxicity between the agents used to treat it are clear, but therapeutic differences are more difficult to discern. Meta-analyses suggest that a moderate advantage for linezolid over daptomycin may exist, but problems with the nature of studies that they included make definitive conclusions difficult.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^116s9Vx4]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In light of the scarcity of treatment options for VRE UTI and clinical data related to daptomycin use in this setting, the purpose of this report is to describe the clinical experience with daptomycin as part of the management of VRE UTIs in our acute care hospital. Our objective is to offer further evidence supporting daptomycin as a viable approach to managing a continuing therapeutic challenge.

### Control of vancomycin-resistant enterococci: one size fits all? [^117TcHnt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates; it poses a serious threat, in particular, to immunosuppressed patients. It generates high costs and challenges infection-control programs. Here, we look at the insights that mathematical models offer into the epidemiology of VRE colonization and infection, the potential benefits of various infection-control interventions, and the possibility of designing a tailored approach to controlling VRE. Models show that epidemics of VRE infection in diverse institutions may differ in the relative contributions of cross-transmission and the influx of new cases, as well as in the various mechanisms of local transmission. They also highlight the phenomenon of decreasing returns associated with many interventions and, hence, the need to identify the most important routes of transmission, to break the weakest links in the chain of transmission, and to contain the influx of cases of VRE infection. These observations also provide insights into the management of infection with other antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^111Jpnv9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Enterococcus Species

If enterococci (especially Enterococcus faecalis) are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, this should be the initial agent of choice, with up to a week intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin is increasing (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.,

IV fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal FRI, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

### Antibiotic-resistant enterococci: the mechanisms and dynamics of drug introduction and resistance [^115N4M25]. Microbes and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Enterococci possess a vast array of mechanisms to resist the lethal effects of most antimicrobial drugs currently approved for therapeutic use in humans, thus presenting a considerable therapeutic challenge. This review summarizes current concepts regarding the mechanisms of resistance, as well as the emergence, proliferation, and epidemiology of resistant enterococci.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^113dQJ6a]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In this case series, patients with VRE UTIs were treated with daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that has rapid bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin acts by binding to bacterial cell membranes and inducing rapid depolarization, which inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and leads to cell death. In the 10 cases described here, daptomycin was chosen as the treatment option because of its efficacy profile, sensitivity testing, and low resistance rates for both major species of Enterococcus.

Another important consideration when appropriate treatment for VRE UTI is chosen is the presence of intact drug at the site of infection. Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney; approximately 52% is excreted unchanged into the urine after intravenous administration. Other agents active against VRE, such as linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline, have a lower fraction of urinary excretion, which may potentially limit their effectiveness in the management of VRE UTIs.

Most strains of VRE are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, although higher-dose ampicillin, doxycycline, and nitrofurantoin remain viable treatment options. More often, drug choices used to treat VRE include daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline. These compounds have similarly low MIC values against VRE species. All these antibiotics except daptomycin exhibit bacteriostatic properties; daptomycin is bactericidal. Daptomycin has similar MIC values for E. faecium and E. faecalis and is effective in treating either pathogen. Daptomycin resistance among VRE strains remains rare; numerous global surveillance studies have demonstrated higher susceptibility levels in VRE strains using daptomycin than in strains using linezolid or quinupristin–dalfopristin. Resistance to linezolid among VRE isolates has been well described and is of increasing clinical concern. Quinupristin–dalfopristin has limited activity against E. faecalis. In addition, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains have shown emerging resistance to quinupristin–dalfopristin; 3.4% of urinary tract isolates were resistant in a study at 28 medical centers in the United States. Use of quinupristin–dalfopristin is also limited by its potential systemic and infusion site–related adverse effects, including myalgia and arthralgia.

### Microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria [^117VXnUd]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and other Gram-positive bacteria. Data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against MRSA. Linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. The investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. Dalbavancin inhibits vanB type VRE at low concentrations, but is not active against vanA type VRE. Telavancin is less active against VRE than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against VRE. With continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci co-colonization [^113WyPse]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is that investigators were unable to determine the species of the VRE isolates. Historically, Enterococcus faecalis has been more likely to be associated with conjugation events and subsequent VRSA colonization or infection compared with E. faecium. However, only 3 VRSA cases are known, and we are not aware of any biologic explanation for why E. faecium would be less likely to be involved in transmission of vancomycin resistance to MRSA compared with E. faecalis. Still, these data would have been useful and informative. A previous, hospitalwide study at UMMC suggested that among isolated VRE, the prevalence of E. faecium and E. faecalis were 87%, and 13%, respectively.

In summary, these data describe a high prevalence of patients co-colonized with VRE and MRSA on admission to an ICU at a tertiary-care hospital, none of whom would have been detected by clinical culture. Risk factors for VRE and MRSA co-colonization are also described. Given that many of these patients were discharged to other institutions, treating physicians and infection control personnel must be cognizant of the risks for VRSA colonization and infection and use appropriate precautions. Appropriate methods to rapidly detect co-colonized patients must be identified to suppress the emergence of VRSA; limit patient-to-patient transmission of MRSA, VRE, and VRSA; and prevent endemic VRSA colonization in healthcare institutions.

### Impact of antibiotic use on the evolution of Enterococcus faecium [^116BSLgd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The current article incorporates many ecological complexities by assessing fitness in the mammalian murine system. Why were significant differences between strains only measurable when strains were paired? There are 2 possible explanations: (1) the added strain competes directly with the test strain, depriving it of nutrients or other factors needed for survival and replication (or, as for V583 in the presence of commensals, being killed by it); or (2) the added strain serves as an internal control, which normalizes for animal-to-animal variation, allowing subtler differences to be detected. As there was no deviation from first-order elimination, such as a finding that might suggest growth or establishment during the course of experimentation, the latter seems more likely.

The results generated in this substantial undertaking provide additional support for the collective body of work that indicates that enterococci that are adapted to survival and proliferation in hospital (and agricultural) settings are less well adapted for life outside of those environments. Precisely defining the ecological space that multidrug-resistant hospital-endemic strains of enterococci occupy and how this space differs from that of commensal strains is important for understanding how to manage patients in a way that limits VRE colonization and the subsequent overgrowth that leads to infection. Detecting subtle but potentially important differences may require the incorporation of human flora, a human diet, studies in animals anatomically more similar to humans, and/or studies over longer times to allow for establishment of the added flora. In some humans, the presence of microbes identified as Barnesiella species aids in resistance to VRE colonization. The extent to which there are homologs for such specific antagonisms in the murine model is unclear. Nevertheless, important steps were taken by Montealegre et al in their use of a tractable experimental model, which provides insights into how we may impede the spread and proliferation of hospital-endemic multidrug-resistant enterococci, a leading concern in an era when antibiotic resistance is outstripping the introduction of new drugs.

### Nosocomial infection with vancomycin-dependent enterococci [^1179bWDn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Renal insufficiency was the other risk factor identified in our study. The ecologic impact of vancomycin exposure is magnified and extended in patients with renal insufficiency, especially those with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (all 3 of our patients and 5 of the 16 previously reported cases), where a single dose persists in the patient's body for many days. The emergence of novel strains of Staphylococcus aureus exhibiting resistance to vancomycin has also been reported in this clinical setting. The prevalence of nosocomial infection or colonization with VDE can only be determined by the use of media containing vancomycin when processing cultures from patients at risk for VDE infection, namely those who have had prolonged exposure to vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins, especially if they are already known to be colonized or infected by VRE.

These infections are clearly not trivial, although their clinical importance remains to be fully determined. Five of the 16 previously reported VDE infections were bacteremias. VDE was considered the immediate cause of death in one of our patients and a contributory cause in another. Green et al. reported the spontaneous reversion of VDE to nondependence at 1 in 10 6, which we confirmed in all three of our strains. Thus, vancomycin discontinuation alone may not be sufficient to treat patients with VDE infection, especially if the patient has renal failure.

The best management of infection with VDE — beyond source control and treatment with linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or daptomycin — remains to be determined. More effective antimicrobial stewardship policies are needed to prevent VDE, VRE, and other resistant nosocomial pathogens from emerging.

### The future approach for the management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^112kxeiF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT

Long-acting antibiotics: dalbavancin and oritavancin

The availability of long-acting antibiotics may ensure a direct discharge from ED or an early discharge from the hospital. This approach may be of great interest to reduce hospitalization and its potential associated complications. Characteristics of long-acting antibiotics available for the management of patents with ABSSSI are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of new available therapeutic options for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections

Dalbavancin and oritavancin are authorized in patients with ABSSSI caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA, and multiple Streptococcus species. Oritavancin has also been authorized for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Recent data suggested that dalbavancin retains in-vitro activity against vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) (vanB and vanC) and other uncommon Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci. Unlike dalbavancin, oritavancin retains activity vancomycin-susceptible and VRE, including both vanA and vanB, due to the peculiar mechanisms of direct interaction with cell membrane. Efficacy and safety of the two long-acting antibiotics have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), DISCOVER 1/DISCOVER 2 and SOLO 1/SOLO2, respectively. Real-life data confirmed these favourable findings both for dalbavancin and oritavancin.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^111pWX1m]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in infective endocarditis — epidemiology and agents: The rapid emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has become a global issue of major clinical importance. Most of these strains are E faecium, and as many as 95% of strains express multidrug resistance to vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and penicillins; only about 3% of E faecalis strains are multidrug resistant, and many vancomycin-resistant E faecalis are penicillin susceptible. Enterococci are considered to be resistant to vancomycin if MICs are > 4 μg/mL. Linezolid and daptomycin are the only 2 antimicrobial agents currently available in the United States that may be useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant E faecium IE; quinupristin-dalfopristin may be active in vitro only against strains of E faecium and is inactive against E faecalis, and tigecycline is active in vitro against some strains of multidrug-resistant enterococci, but there are minimal published data on its use clinically.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112fCLif]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus and MRSA management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is addressed with graded suggestions: We suggest that ampicillin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide pathogen-directed therapy against susceptible enterococcal strains (Grade 2-B). We suggest that vancomycin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Grade 2-B), and we suggest inclusion of vancomycin in an aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). We suggest that linezolid and daptomycin may be used for management of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., and as an alternative to vancomycin for suspected or proven infections because of MRSA (Grade 2-B).

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: why are they here, and where do they come from? [^115RL4ST]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2001). Medium credibility.

Vancomcyin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens in the past 10 years, causing epidemiological controversy. In the USA, colonisation with VRE is endemic in many hospitals and increasingly causes infection, but colonisation is absent in healthy people. In Europe, outbreaks still happen sporadically, usually with few serious infections, but colonisation seems to be endemic in healthy people and farm animals. Vancomycin use has been much higher in the USA, where emergence of ampicillin-resistant enterococci preceded emergence of VRE, making them very susceptible to the selective effects of antibiotics. In Europe, avoparcin, a vancomycin-like glycopeptide, has been widely used in the agricultural industry, explaining the community reservoir in European animals. Avoparcin has not been used in the USA, which is consistent with the absence of colonisation in healthy people. From the European animal reservoir, VRE and resistance genes have spread to healthy human beings and hospitalised patients. However, certain genogroups of enterococci in both continents seem to be more capable of causing hospital outbreaks, perhaps because of the presence of a specific virulence factor, the variant esp gene. By contrast with the evidence of a direct link between European animal and human reservoirs, the origin of American resistance genes remains to be established. Considering the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, the emergence of VRE has emphasised the non-existence of boundaries between hospitals, between people and animals, between countries, and probably between continents.

### Can oritavancin Be used for treatment and / or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of bone and joint infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium? [^116yDFTX]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections pose substantial challenges for the treatment and suppression of bone and joint infections. Oritavancin, a long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against VRE. Limited data are available on using oritavancin for bone and joint infections caused by VRE, both for treatment (therapy to eliminate active infection) and suppressive antimicrobial therapy (long-term antibiotic administration to prevent infection recurrence in patients at high risk for that complication).

Questions/Purposes

(1) What proportion of patients in a small case series achieve freedom from infectious symptoms with use of oritavancin for treatment of VRE bone and joint infections? (2) What proportion of patients achieve freedom from infection recurrence with use of oritavancin when used for suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infections? (3) What proportion of patients develop adverse drug events associated with oritavancin use in VRE bone and joint infections?

Methods

We describe a retrospective, multicenter, observational case series of patients who received oritavancin for treatment and/or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infection, including osteomyelitis, native septic arthritis, myositis, and prosthetic joint infection, between December 2014 and April 2024. The minimum surveillance period was 1 year, unless infection recurrence or an adverse drug event was documented before 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a life expectancy of less than 7 days, dual use of VRE antibiotics, or brain or spinal cord abscesses related to VRE, although no patients met these exclusion criteria in our study group. Clinical signs and symptoms of infection, corresponding microbiological cultures, and adverse drug events were assessed throughout follow-up. Eleven patients (6 treatment, 5 suppressive antimicrobial therapy) with VRE (all Enterococcus faecium) bone and joint infection in which at least one dose of oritavancin was used were included. No patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up time. In the treatment group, the median (range) age was 60 years (48 to 66), 4 of 6 patients were male, and patients had received prior therapy for VRE with either linezolid or daptomycin. Infections were hardware-associated osteomyelitis in 2 of 6 patients, osteomyelitis in 3 of 6, and prosthetic joint infection in 1 of 6. In the suppressive antimicrobial therapy group, the median (range) age was 61 years (25 to 68), and 3 of 5 patients were female. Four of 5 patients had hardware-associated infections, including 3 of 5 with hardware-associated osteomyelitis and 1 of 5 with prosthetic joint infection of the hip.

Results

In the treatment group, 2 of 6 patients remained symptom free at a minimum follow-up of 3 years (range 3.0 to 3.25), and 2 patients developed recurrent infection-one with worsening knee stiffness and growth of VRE and one with radiologic signs of osteomyelitis and growth of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Candida glabrata. One of 6 patients in the treatment group was lost to follow-up, and one pursued end-of-life care after 28 days. All 5 patients who underwent suppressive antimicrobial therapy remained free from recurrent symptoms with a minimum duration of therapy of 21 months (range 21 to 48). After 48 months of oritavancin as suppressive antimicrobial therapy, one patient in the cohort developed an infusion reaction-shortness of breath, cough, and hypotension-resulting in drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

In this small, retrospective cohort of patients with multiple comorbidities, oritavancin showed possible promise as suppressive antimicrobial therapy for VRE bone and joint infection, with all patients receiving suppressive antimicrobial therapy lacking recurrence of infectious symptoms. However, the role of oritavancin as treatment-in salvage situations after multiple therapies failed-appeared more limited in preventing infection recurrence. Larger studies are needed to further define the role of oritavancin in the treatment of VRE bone and joint infections.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^1177CRNL]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus infective endocarditis (IE) caused by strains resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin — treatment and care team guidance include the following: Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 h for > 6 weeks is a Class IIb; Level of Evidence C option, and linezolid use may be associated with potentially severe bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and numerous drug interactions; daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg per dose for > 6 weeks is also Class IIb; Level of Evidence C, and if daptomycin therapy is selected, then doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1·24 h−1 may be considered. Patients with IE attributable to Enterococcus species resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin should be managed by specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics (Class I; Level of Evidence C); patients with IE caused by these strains should be treated by a care team including specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, in children, pediatrics, and cardiac valve replacement may be necessary for cure. Combination therapy with daptomycin and ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered, especially in patients with persistent bacteremia or enterococcal strains with high MICs (ie, 3 μg/mL) to daptomycin within the susceptible range (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Doses recommended are for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^1166U8U9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We also found that patients who were VRE positive were more likely to have been infected or colonized with MRSA or C. difficile in the past year. This association has been previously describedand, in our data, was independent of vancomycin treatment. This relationship likely reflects shared mechanisms of acquisition for these nosocomial pathogens and a common association with severity of illness.

Our study has certain limitations. We assumed that time of VRE positivity was similar to time of acquisition for cases. This assumption is likely incorrect but is the best possible estimate in this type of study. Studies based on serial surveillance cultures may yield a more accurate estimate of time of acquisition but cannot reach an adequate sample size to perform statistical analysis controlling for confounding. If we had performed serial cultures twice a week on all our source population, we would have processed > 100,000 surveillance cultures. Indeed, almost all previous studies on this subject had a similar assumption. Control patients were representative of the hospital-based population but were not screened to exclude undetected VRE colonization. However, it is unlikely that misclassification bias could simultaneously account for the substantial effect observed with certain antibiotics and lack of effect observed with others. Moreover, the results of a meta-analysis also suggest that the magnitude of association between vancomycin treatment and VRE was independent of the method of VRE detection, i.e. clinical or surveillance cultures. Another caveat is that the results of this study apply to individual risk for VRE. Antibiotics may have differential effects on the quantity of VRE excreted from already colonized persons, as suggested both by animal models and human data. Thus, the effects of antibiotics on ecologic risk, e.g. transmission of VRE to other patients, may differ from their effects on individual risk. Finally, the power of this study to examine the effects of oral antibiotics was limited because of the small number of patients treated with these agents. Along the same lines, because of their limited use, these agents are unlikely to play a major role in the epidemiology of VRE within hospitals.

We conclude that patients treated with third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole, or quinolones for an extended duration appear to be at significantly higher risk for VRE. Antecedent treatment with vancomycin is not a risk factor for VRE infection or colonization. Further studies to examine the routes of transmission of VRE and the ecologic role of antibiotics are needed.

### Vancomycin [^111mfxh2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis.

Resistance

Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibacterials.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis), Enterococcus spp, and the viridans group streptococci.

Antimicrobial Activity

Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

Corynebacterium spp.

Enterococcu s spp. (including Enterococcus faecalis)

Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible isolates)

Coagulase negative staphylococci (including S.epidermidis and methicillin-resistant isolates)

Streptococcus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis)

Viridans group streptococci

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for vancomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of vancomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

Listeria monocytogenes

Streptococcus pyogenes

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus agalactiae

Anaerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: therapeutic challenges in the 21st century [^1153uRwy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are serious health threats due in part to their ability to persist in rugged environments and their propensity to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. Enterococci have now established a home in our hospitals and possess mechanisms to defeat most currently available antimicrobials. This article reviews the history of the struggle with this pathogen, what is known about the traits associated with its rise in the modern medical environment, and the current understanding of therapeutic approaches in severe infections caused by these microorganisms. As the 21st century progresses, vancomycin-resistant enterococci continue to pose a daunting clinical challenge.

### Global spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from distinct nosocomial genetic complex [^113H3apT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) followed a worst-case scenario for nosocomial pathogens: the first VRE isolates that harbored the vanA transposon were identified in 1987 in Europe, and within 10 years VRE represented > 25% of enterococci associated with bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients in the United States.

Enterococci are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. Two species cause most enterococcal infections, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The relative importance of E. faecium as a pathogen has increased with the occurrence of high-level resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs, such as ampicillin and vancomycin. The rapid increase of vancomycin resistance compromises physicians' ability to treat infections caused by many of these strains because often no other antimicrobial drugs are available. The epidemiology of VRE infection differs between Europe and the United States. In Europe, VRE are frequently isolated from farm animals, which have been associated with the abundant use of avoparcin as a growth promoter in the agricultural industry, until it was banned in 1997. The reported prevalence of VRE in hospitals has been low, but increasing rates (> 10%) in stool and clinical samples were reported recently. In the United States, avoparcin was never approved for use in agriculture, and neither were any other glycopeptides; consequently, VRE have not been found in animals or healthy persons. However, nosocomial VRE infection and transmission have occurred much more frequently in the United States. Recent reports have documented, in hospitalized patients, horizontal transfer of the vanA gene from vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), creating MRSA with high-level resistance to vancomycin. Nosocomial spread of VRE may therefore create a reservoir of mobile resistance genes for other, more virulent, nosocomial pathogens. Without extensive control measures, large-scale emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) may be the next stage in the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance.

### Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective [^114xdmsL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^11141y12]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society — anti-enterococcal therapy for hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) identifies risk and empiric options as follows: We suggest that patients with HA-IAI who have a post-operative infection, have had substantial recent exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, who manifest signs of severe sepsis or septic shock, or who are known to be colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) be considered at risk for infection from Enterococcus spp. (Grade 2-B). For empiric therapy in patients considered at risk for Enterococcus spp., we suggest vancomycin or teicoplanin, and we suggest use of linezolid or daptomycin for management of HA-IAI in patients known to be colonized with VRE or considered at high risk for infection from this organism (Grade 2-B).

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^114HU9Go]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Our major findings were 1) vancomycin was not associated with VRE positivity, a finding consistent with the results of the meta-analysis on this subject; 2) third-generation cephalosporins and parenteral metronidazole were highly significant independent risk factors for VRE; and 3) only fluoroquinolones exhibited a statistically significant linear relationship between intensity (duration) of exposure and risk for VRE. In contrast, for metronidazole and third-generation cephalosporins, a threshold-type (all or none) effect was observed. The risk for VRE in patients treated with these agents was increased regardless of duration of therapy.

The small effect of parenteral vancomycin in the unadjusted analysis was completely erased after the data were controlled for confounding by patient characteristics and treatment with other antibiotics, mainly treatment with third-generation cephalosporins and metronidazole. Thus, individual patients who received vancomycin did not appear to be at any increased risk for VRE infection. We believe that the lack of effect of vancomycin on VRE found in this study, a finding that contradicts the results of many earlier studies, relates to our compliance with adequate epidemiologic principles in study design and analysis. These principles include controlling for length of stay, choosing the control group from the source population, matching for endemicity by matching on time and location, and adjusting for other antibiotic exposures. Most early studies that identified vancomycin as a strong risk factor for VRE failed to account for these principles.

These data do not dispute the role of glycopeptide use in promoting the emergence of glycopeptide resistance; this role may be related to glycopeptides' effect on the possibility of a positive patient's becoming a transmitter, rather than on increasing the risk of the susceptible person's becoming colonized. Indeed, our study was aimed at the individual level and not at the group level. A recent study performed at the group level demonstrated that ICUs in which vancomycin is heavily used have higher rates of VRE. We believe that the discordant results between individual level and group level analysisand the effect of glycopeptides on the possibility of transmission among the already colonized patients deserve further study. The results of our analysis, as well as results of other studies, call into question whether restricting vancomycin will lower VRE incidence.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^114Vf6e6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In this study the number of peritoneal microorganisms per sample was ≥ 3 in 34% and 54% of cases, respectively, for community-acquired and nosocomial infections (P < 0.001). The distribution of the microorganisms differed according to the nosocomial or community origin of the infection but not according to their location (data not shown). In nosocomial patients, increased proportions of Enterococcus faecalis (33% versus 19% in community-acquired patients; P < 0.05) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (13% versus 5% in community-acquired patients; P < 0.01) were observed. Conversely, in nosocomial patients, decreased proportions of Escherichia coli (52% versus 72% in community-acquired patients, P < 0.001) and streptococci strains were reported (31% versus 50% in community-acquired patients, P < 0.01).

Therefore the inclusion of anti-enterococcal drugs in any empirical antibiotic regimens in severe nosocomial IAIs and/or in patients with well known risk factors, seems appropriate, mainly if directed against E. faecalis.

Empiric therapy directed against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is not recommended unless the patient is at very high risk for an infection due to this organism, such as a liver transplant recipient with an intra-abdominal infection originating in the hepatobiliary tree or a patient known to be colonized with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

Enterococcus infections are difficult to treat because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many penicillins, and all cephalosporins with the possible exception of ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Besides Enterococci have acquired resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, to which the organisms are not intrinsically resistant, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and penicillins. Many strains of E. faecalis are susceptible to certain penicillins and glycopeptides; however, some strains of E. faecium may be resistant to these agents.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults… [^116PXbDX]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The lack of a standard diagnostic workup leads to frustration for physicians and patients, and numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures are often performed without arriving at a definitive diagnosis. 1, 3 Currently, the most widely accepted definition of FUO requires only a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions and an unrevealing diagnostic workup. 2, 4 Previous definitions have provided suggested minimal time frames for investigation; however, these were acknowledged to be arbitrary and are not included in the current consensus definition. 2, 4. Echocardiography is useful when evaluating for infective endocarditis. Importantly, rates of infective endocarditis are rising in younger patients in part because of injection drug use. 18 Ultrasonography or computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis can assist in identifying abscesses.

17 Ultrasonography is often the first-line recommendation because it has a lower cost and radiation exposure is avoided; however, CT has a high sensitivity and specificity in determining the etiology of FUO.
11. Evaluation for Inflammatory Diseases. In a prospective study, the three most common inflammatory conditions in FUO were Still disease, large vessel vasculitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. 20 An elevated white blood cell count, elevated ESR, and extremely elevated ferritin level are consistent with adult Still disease. Elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and/or antinuclear antibody indicate rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus as the etiology of the FUO. Patients with sarcoidosis may demonstrate characteristic findings on chest radiography or CT, including interstitial lung disease and hilar adenopathy.

23 Likewise, abdominal CT findings of mural wall thickening may point toward Crohn disease. 24 Evaluation for Miscellaneous Causes. Venous duplex imaging of the lower extremities can rule out venous thromboembolism, which in one study represented the etiology of FUO in 6% of patients. 25 An elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level should raise suspicion of thyroiditis as the etiology of the FUO; thyroid-stimulating hormone may also be suppressed in thyroiditis. 17 Additionally, an electrolyte panel and liver enzymes can help identify other etiologies.

### Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^111VAZbJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^113qdSWD]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus accounts for 12% of all cases of hospital-acquired infection and is most often implicated in urinary tract infections (UTIs). Recent data show that approximately 33% of all clinical enterococcal isolates in the United States are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In North America, VRE are mainly derived from the species Enterococcus faecium (92.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.7%). In the past decade, VRE have become increasingly involved in nosocomial infections in the United States, which has resulted in excessive morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Nearly 10% of all urinary enterococcal isolates in the United States are VRE; most of these are also E. faecium (88.4%).

### Vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci [^112DieQQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus species were reported in Europe in 1988. Similar strains were later detected in hospitals on the East Coast of the United States. Since then, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have spread with unexpected rapidity and are now encountered in hospitals in most countries. This article reviews the mode of action and the mechanism of bacterial resistance to glycopeptides, as exemplified by the VanA type, which is mediated by transposon Tn1546 and is widely spread in enterococci. The diversity, regulation, evolution, and recent dissemination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are then discussed.

### Duration of contact precautions for acute-care settings [^116tyxHU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) contact precautions (CP) — discontinuation criteria and recurrence — are outlined. Early guidance suggested that CP for VRE should be discontinued after 3 negative stool cultures obtained at least 1 week apart, and subsequent guidelines from CDC and HICPAC supported this practice in the absence of uncontrolled respiratory secretions, draining wounds, or the involvement of the patient in an institutional outbreak. Sequential testing revealed that after 3 sequential negative cultures, 35 of 37 patients (95%) remained culture negative. One institution, which defined VRE clearance as 3 negative stool cultures more than 3 weeks apart, found that VRE recolonization occurred in 5 of 21 patients (24%). The same authors identified 12 patients who had at least 2 VRE-positive cultures more than 1 year apart, and individuals who had cleared with 3 negative stool cultures collected at least 1 week apart had a high recurrence rate (62%) if they were exposed to antibiotics in the following year.

### The rise of the Enterococcus: beyond vancomycin resistance [^112HkSqg]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The genus Enterococcus includes some of the most important nosocomial multidrug-resistant organisms, and these pathogens usually affect patients who are debilitated by other, concurrent illnesses and undergoing prolonged hospitalization. This Review discusses the factors involved in the changing epidemiology of enterococcal infections, with an emphasis on Enterococcus faecium as an emergent and challenging nosocomial problem. The effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and on colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci are highlighted, including how enterococci benefit from the antibiotic-mediated eradication of gram-negative members of the gut microbiota. Analyses of enterococcal genomes indicate that there are certain genetic lineages, including an E. faecium clade of ancient origin, with the ability to succeed in the hospital environment, and the possible virulence determinants that are found in these genetic lineages are discussed. Finally, we review the most important mechanisms of resistance to the antibiotics that are used to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

Patient reported fever If the patient reports a fever > 38. 0°C, during the POA timeframe and within the IWP of a positive urine culture, the fever can be used to determine if a UTI event occurred during the POA timeframe. A general report of "fever" by the patient, without an accompanying temperature measurement, may not be used.

Costovertebral angle pain or tenderness Generalized "low back pain" in the medical record is not interpreted as CVA pain or tenderness, as there can be many causes of low back pain. Left, right, or bilateral lower back or flank pain is acceptable to describe costovertebral pain. Suprapubic tenderness and "With no other recognized cause" Pain documented as "abdominal pain" in the medical record is too general and not to be interpreted as suprapubic tenderness as there are many causes of abdominal pain. Lower abdominal pain, or bladder or pelvic pain or discomfort are acceptable documentation to meet NHSN's UTI symptom of suprapubic tenderness.

Ideally, clinical decisions about "with no other recognized cause" for the UTI signs/symptoms, suprapubic tenderness or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, should be made by a physician and/or their designee in your organization who has access to a patient's entire medical record and clinical picture. The other recognized cause must occur during the current admission. Clinical judgment determination must be able to be defended and backed up by physician documentation and there should be clear rationale for that determination in the event the case is validated. Leg bags/attaching urometers Yes. Both practices may increase the risk of UTI, and these patients should be included in CAUTI surveillance.

### Which antibiotic for resistant Gram-positives, and why? [^114UXwqL]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Increasing resistance in Gram-positive pathogens, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus, has become a major clinical problem, particularly in the hospital environment, causing significant morbidity and mortality in both healthy hosts and in those with underlying comorbidities. Increased resistance drives the use of empiric therapy with less well-studied and potentially more toxic agents. Resistance mechanisms for currently recommended agents are discussed, with options for therapy of resistant pathogens. For any new agent used, resistance is likely to develop, which underscores the concept that both antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance are ancient, and only by prudent use of antimicrobial agents and effective infection control measures when resistance arises, will effective agents be available to treat Gram-positive pathogens in the future.

### Treatment considerations for CNS infections caused by vancomycin-resistant: a focused review of linezolid and daptomycin [^111Vvgh8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current literature describing pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy, and safety of linezolid and daptomycin for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) faecium.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE databases was conducted (from 1950 to April 2020) utilizing the following key terms: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE, meningitis, ventriculitis, CNS infection, daptomycin, and linezolid.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All relevant studies and case reports describing the treatment of VRE faecium from the CNS with linezolid or daptomycin were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 17 reports describing 22 cases were identified. There were 15 of 19 cases involving linezolid that reported clinical cure, of which 53.3% were monotherapy. Only 5 of 9 cases involving intravenous (IV) daptomycin resulted in cure; all 4 cases reporting daptomycin administration via the intrathecal or intraventricular route achieved clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

The preferred treatment option for VRE faecium infections involving the CNS remains unclear. Supporting evidence through observational case reports have described varying outcomes with linezolid and daptomycin. This review compares reported outcomes between the 2 agents and provides a thorough discussion on drug- and patient-specific variables to consider.

Conclusions

Linezolid monotherapy appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of susceptible-VRE faecium CNS infections, with consideration of therapeutic drug monitoring in special populations and with prolonged treatment duration. Daptomycin is an effective treatment option via intrathecal or intraventricular administration when neurosurgical access is available. The role of IV daptomycin remains inconclusive.

### Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid: evidence and opinion [^114pyAgo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrate in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including many isolates resistant to earlier antimicrobials. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against Enterococcus faecalis but has been effective for treatment of infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium associated with bacteremia. In comparative trials, linezolid proved to be equivalent to comparator agents, resulting in its approval for several clinical indications. The almost-complete bioavailability of linezolid permits oral administration. Each agent can cause adverse effects that may limit use in individual patients. Resistance to these drugs has been encountered infrequently among vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is rare among staphylococci in the United States, and resistance to linezolid is very rare. Whether there is any benefit to use of these agents in combination regimens, and whether there are circumstances in which they might be alternatives to cell-wall active antibiotics for treatment of bone or endovascular infections, are questions that deserve further study.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^115bxM7C]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

First isolated in the late 1980s, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have rapidly become established as important nosocomial pathogens in the United States. In some hospitals, VRE are responsible for > 20% of enterococcal infections.

Given the complex genetic machinery required to confer vancomycin resistance, de novo emergence of resistance is unlikely in an individual patient. Thus, newly detected VRE may represent either acquisition of resistant organisms (or genes) or expansion of preexisting but undetected populations of VRE with which the patient is colonized. The likelihood of nosocomial VRE may vary with time and space, according to the endemicity of VRE in a specific location (i.e. colonization pressure) and to the duration of hospitalization (i.e. time at risk). Indeed, initially most VRE isolates were recovered from patients in intensive-care units (ICUs); later VRE became more prevalent in patients on other wards. Certain coexisting conditions, e.g. malignancies, organ transplants, and chronic renal failure, were found to be associated with increased risk for VRE, as were exposure to contaminated equipment and proximity to a VRE carrier.

Enterococcus faecalis β-lactamase and intrinsic resistance — susceptibility notes: Rarely, strains of E faecalis produce an inducible β-lactamase; these β-lactamase–producing strains are susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam and to vancomycin. Intrinsic penicillin resistance is uncommon in E faecalis but is common in E faecium, and it is reasonable to treat patients with E faecalis IE caused by strains that are intrinsically resistant to penicillin with a combination of vancomycin plus gentamicin.

### Bacteriophage resistance alters antibiotic-mediated intestinal expansion of enterococci [^112w8vH3]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis is a human intestinal pathobiont with intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics, including vancomycin. Nature provides a diverse and virtually untapped repertoire of bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages (phages), that could be harnessed to combat multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections. Bacterial phage resistance represents a potential barrier to the implementation of phage therapy, emphasizing the importance of investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of phage resistance. Using a cohort of 19 environmental lytic phages with tropism against E. faecalis, we found that these phages require the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (Epa) for productive infection. Epa is a surface-exposed heteroglycan synthesized by enzymes encoded by both conserved and strain-specific genes. We discovered that exposure to phage selective pressure favors mutation in nonconserved epa genes both in culture and in a mouse model of intestinal colonization. Despite gaining phage resistance, epa mutant strains exhibited a loss of resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Finally, we show that an E. faecalis epa mutant strain is deficient in intestinal colonization, cannot expand its population upon antibiotic-driven intestinal dysbiosis, and fails to be efficiently transmitted to juvenile mice following birth. This study demonstrates that phage therapy could be used in combination with antibiotics to target enterococci within a dysbiotic microbiota. Enterococci that evade phage therapy by developing resistance may be less fit at colonizing the intestine and sensitized to vancomycin, preventing their overgrowth during antibiotic treatment.

### Bacteriocin production facilitates nosocomial emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [^114FSz3c]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

In summary, we characterized the local and global population structure and temporal dynamics of VREfm using comparative genomics and functional analyses. By investigating VREfm populations sampled over 6 years at our healthcare centre and over 20 years globally, we identified lineage replacement associated with the spread of strains encoding bacteriocin T8. Phenotypic characterization showed that bacteriocin T8 probably contributes to VREfm lineage replacement by conferring a strong competitive advantage that is observed both in vitro and in vivo. Although we identified bacteriocin T8 production as a potential adaptive mechanism directing VREfm lineage replacement, this study prompts further investigation into other features driving the evolutionary dynamics in this important and difficult-to-treat pathogen.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^115tSg2c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant pathogens

The threat of antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major challenges in the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections.

Over the past few decades, an increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. has been observed, also in intra-abdominal infections.

Management of severe intra-abdominal infections must always include a balance between optimizing empirical therapy, which has been shown to improve outcomes, and reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use. Bacterial resistance is becoming a very important problem. Despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance in clinical isolates, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. Some broad-spectrum agents maintain still satisfactory profiles of safety and efficacy in treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria in complicated intra-abdominal infections but they must be used judiciously to preserve their effectiveness against multidrug resistant pathogens.

Enterococcus

Enterococcus infections are difficult to treat because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many penicillins, and all cephalosporins with the possible exception of ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Besides Enterococci have acquired resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, to which the organisms are not intrinsically resistant, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and penicillins. Many strains of E. faecalis are susceptible to certain penicillins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones; however, virtually all strains of E. faecium are resistant to these agents.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) infections have bee associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Resistance of Enterococci to vancomycin was reported in Europe in 1986 and the prevalence of infections related to VRE has continued to increase annually.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^112k7oa7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Methods

The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center–West Campus is a 320-bed urban tertiary-care teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. It has 24 ICU beds and approximately 12,000 patient admissions each year. The institutional antibiotic policy requires approval by an infectious disease consultant for the use of third-generation cephalosporins (other than ceftriaxone), antipseudomonal agents, and vancomycin (for more than one dose).

Data were collected from administrative, pharmacy, clinical, and laboratory computerized databases by using a relational database management system (Access, Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA). The databases and methods of data collection have been described.

Enterococci were identified from clinical specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory by using the Gram-Positive Identification Panel (Dade Behring Inc. Deerfield, IL). Enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance by plating on brain heart infusion agar with 6 µg/mL vancomycin. Vancomycin resistance was confirmed by formal MIC testing with the microdilution broth method (MicroScan, Dade International Inc.). Isolates with vancomycin MICs ≥ 8 µg/mL were classified as VRE.

Definitions and Study Design

The study was designed as a matched case-control study. All inpatients from whom VRE were first isolated from a clinical culture (either infected or colonized patients) in our hospital from October 1, 1993, through December 31, 1997, were enrolled as cases. Patients transferred from another institution and known to be VRE positive at that time were not included in this study. Patients and controls were matched on the basis of three variables: hospital ward, calendar time (within 7 days), and duration of hospital stay at the time of matching (up to 3 days' difference if no exact match was available). Up to three appropriately matched control-patients who were not VRE positive (i.e. patient was cultured and no VRE were isolated or the patient was never cultured) were randomly selected for each case. A list of all possible controls was created. Each was assigned a random number, and the three highest random numbers were chosen (without replacement). We looked for risk factors by examining demographics, admitting diagnosis, coexisting conditions (based on ICD-9 codes and electronic records), transfer from another institution, admission to an ICU and number of days in ICU, major surgical procedure, and infection with Clostridium difficile or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After controlling for confounding by these variables, we compared, in detail, antecedent treatments with different antibiotic agents.

### Optimizing therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia in children [^1142m23m]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Uncertainties exist regarding the optimal treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bloodstream infections, particularly in settings in which ampicillin cannot be used.

Recent Findings

Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, all approved between 1999 and 2003, represent the mainstays of therapy for VRE bacteremia, although only linezolid has been specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this indication. The main objective of this review is to compare the relative efficacies, dosing strategies, and side-effect profiles of quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in the pediatric population. A brief description of recently approved broad-spectrum Gram-positive agents that may have a role in the management of VRE bacteremia in upcoming years is also provided.

Summary

Linezolid, despite its bacteriostatic activity against VRE, may be the most versatile of the available drugs. It has activity against both Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, can be administered orally, and resistance appears to be less of a concern with linezolid compared with the other agents. Additionally, the results of two recent meta-analyses demonstrate more favorable outcomes with linezolid compared with daptomycin for the treatment of VRE bacteremia. The clinical pharmacokinetics of linezolid have been well described in children. The most notable concern with linezolid, however, is toxicities associated with prolonged use. Until more prospective data are available, we favor linezolid as first-line therapy for the treatment of VRE bacteremia in children.

### Editorial commentary: linezolid vs daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the evidence gap between trials and clinical experience [^116Kvn5B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

There have been 3 independent systematic reviews of the literature with meta-analysis that sought to compare DAP or linezolid for treatment of VRE-BSI. Although the studies differed in some regards, all 3 meta-analysis suggested a survival benefit of linezolid over DAP. What was perhaps more impressive than the meta-analysis results was the fact that all 3 investigations found significant methodological limitations to the underlying literature. The limitations of prior studies included variable case definitions, limited sample size, heterogeneous patient populations, wide variation in outcome measures, insufficient DAP dosing, and documented but unadjusted treatment selection bias. The methodology of previous studies of VRE-BSI has not been robust and despite rigorous analysis of the literature, the data are not compelling to make sound therapeutic conclusions regarding the best available therapy for VRE-BSI.

Due to the limitations of available studies, the current manuscript by Britt et al represents a welcome contribution to the literature on VRE-BSI and a step forward in the quality of study design. The authors were able to harness the infrastructure of the Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical record to generate a multicenter national cohort investigation of the treatment of VRE-BSI. The authors were careful to choose patients only treated with DAP or linezolid, not those who received sequential treatment. Unlike other investigations, patients were treated with higher doses of DAP (6 mg/kg), although probably not optimal DAP doses for VRE. The authors supplemented electronic data extraction with detailed chart review, including identification of negative culture results, source of infection, and source control. The authors a priori defined outcomes measures that have "real-world" clinical relevance. The nuts and bolts of the study were sound, and the study was well designed.

### Impact of antibiotic use on the evolution of Enterococcus faecium [^113AkSdZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Enterococci are commensals of the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of animals, from simple invertebrates to humans, and likely evolved early in a primitive GIT-type environment. This presumption is supported by their ubiquity and their streamlined genomes (an indicator of host adaptation, which results in a number of nutritional needs that must be fulfilled by the host, the diet of the host, or nutrients produced by other members of the GIT consortium). As the result of widespread antibiotic use over the past 75 years, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have spawned distinct sublineages that are now leading causes of multidrug-resistant infection and are endemic to many hospitals.

Competition among microbes in the gut is intense. The concept of "fitness cost" arises in discussions of microbes acquiring or evolving antibiotic resistance. Enterococci not only have acquired antibiotic resistance, they also have adapted in other ways to the unique hospital niche. The question, then, is whether an approximately 80-year history of adapting to the unusual opportunities for growth within the ecology of the antibiotic treated patient gut (followed by cycles of shedding into the hospital environment, surviving cleaning and disinfection, surviving desiccation, and recolonizing a new patient) has resulted in multidrug-resistant variants that are now ill tuned to compete effectively in a normal human gut. The answer could explain why vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains and infections are common in hospitals but infection and carriage rare in the community. The article by Montealegre et al in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases takes an important step in addressing this question.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: mechanisms and clinical observations [^114X9MPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci are not generally regarded as highly virulent bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to many antimicrobial drugs complicates treatment of enterococcal infections. Acquired resistance to high concentrations of glycopeptide antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, has exacerbated this problem. This article seeks to concisely review the mechanisms of that resistance and its effects on clinical management of enterococcal infections, as well as clinical microbiology and infection control.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^115TxeUH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Microbiome-mediated fructose depletion restricts murine gut colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^113idD6f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO), including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), have become a major threat to public health, compromising our capacity to treat common infectious diseases and increasing the risk of hospital medical procedures. Enterococcus isolates, including VRE, are among the third- to fourth-most prevalent pathogens causing infections in hospitalized patients worldwide, and can potentially lead to lethal outcomes. Because of its wide resistance to multiple antibiotics, which impairs its treatment, VRE is listed among top priority multidrug-resistant pathogens for which new therapies should be developed according to the World Health Organization. Consequently, novel antibiotics have been introduced to treat VRE infections. However, strains resistant to these new antimicrobials rapidly emerge, which encourage the implementation of non-antibiotic strategies to prevent infections by this clinically challenging pathogen.

VRE can colonize hospitalized patients through contamination of skin wounds or catheters, which can lead to urinary tract infections or bacteraemia. In addition, VRE infections can frequently start by the colonization of the intestinal tract, a crucial step that is suppressed by commensal microbes inhabiting the gut (i.e. the microbiota). However, antibiotic therapies disrupt the microbiota, enabling VRE to colonize the intestinal tract to extremely high levels –. Subsequently, VRE dense colonization of the gut promotes its dissemination to the bloodstream, and to other patients through faecal contamination of the environment. Thus, the microbiota acts as a natural defence that prevents most of the potential infections that could be caused by VRE, while antibiotics enhance infections by allowing the first step of VRE gut colonization. Despite its clinical relevance, only a few studies have started to define the members of the microbiota that are key for conferring protection against VRE and the mechanisms providing such protection. Specifically, two studies showed that production of inhibitory molecules by specific commensal bacteria restricts VRE gut colonization. Blautia producta, an anaerobic commensal bacterium, produces a lantibiotic that directly inhibits VRE growth in mice and in vitro. Moreover, the presence of this lantibiotic is associated with lower VRE faecal levels in humans. Similarly, E. faecalis containing a conjugative plasmid expressing a bacteriocin clears VRE gut colonization in mice.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^112zPiC7]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The data in this case series show daptomycin to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs. Limitations of the present study include the fact that this is a retrospective case series with a small number of patients and clinical records that are often limited and variable. Furthermore, because of the paucity of data in the literature, it is unclear what the most appropriate daptomycin dose is for the treatment of VRE UTIs. Nevertheless, it is clear that VRE are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections. Of concern, VRE may transfer vancomycin resistance to other bacterial species, including S. aureus. Uncontrolled dissemination of VRE infections within health care institutions has been facilitated by incautious contact with contaminated medical equipment and surfaces, colonized health care personnel, and infected patients. For example, the spread of a strain of linezolid-resistant VRE has been reported in one zone of a transplantation unit despite extensive precautions.

Another major factor that has led to the spread of VRE infection is poor infection control techniques that rely on cephalosporins and other antibacterials inactive against enterococci. A recent report found that more than 30% of all clinical isolates of Enterococcus were resistant to vancomycin, including more than 90% of E. faecium isolates. For these reasons, appropriate antibiotic susceptibility testing is a mainstay of good clinical practice to limit the spread of multidrug-resistant strains, and agents that have specific activity against these strains must be used to eradicate these difficult-to-treat infections.

The urinary tract is one of the main portals for entry of VRE, so it is hardly surprising that the urinary tract is a major site of infection. Management of VRE UTIs usually requires correction of any factors contributing to the infection. Catheter removal, obstruction relief, abscess drainage, and initiation of antimicrobial therapy are all initial steps taken in clinical practice.

### Editorial commentary: linezolid vs daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the evidence gap between trials and clinical experience [^1127CXnn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

With the failure of 2 VRE-BSI clinical trials to enroll an adequate number of subjects, and the low likelihood of having a "gold-standard" prospective randomized clinical trial, does a single well-designed observational study reporting on the largest published experience with VRE-BSI finally define the optimal therapy for VRE-BSI? We would argue that, much like clinical trials, other multisite and well-designed observational studies should be conducted to more adequately answer the question. In addition to some of the limitations mentioned above, the current study is limited by being nearly all male, based only in VA medical centers, and the cohort contained relatively few transplant patients. Moreover, over 90% of subjects achieved microbiologic clearance, suggesting that this population may not have been as sick as other published cohorts. Indeed, over one-third of the VRE-BSI was line related, and line removal may have played a part in the microbial eradication. Although likely not generalizable for all medical centers, the results of the current manuscript should be reassuring for those who routinely use DAP for VRE-BSI.

The report by Britt et al makes other observations that are relevant to clinical care of patients. First, the data confirm prior observations that VRE-BSI is a serious complication of hospitalization. Treatment failure in this population was over 60%, and the cohort had nearly 10% mortality at 7 days. Second, the data from the current study further support that effective antibiotic therapy and shorter duration of bacteremia are associated with lower mortality in patients with VRE-BSI. Lastly, as it has been shown repeatedly in infectious disease research, time to effective treatment was highly associated with treatment success (68 hours vs 86 hours, P < .001). The importance of time to effective treatment indicates that clinicians should maintain vigilance for patients at risk for VRE-BSI and consider early empiric therapy with activity against VRE-BSI to improve outcomes.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114EjZiS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Alarming rates of resistance have been described for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumanniii complex. These difficult-to-treat MDR bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, but also can acquire resistance to most classes of antibiotic agents. Multiple mechanisms may be present simultaneously, conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics, including membrane permeability defects, expression of efflux pumps, and production of antibiotic-hydrolysing enzymes such as AmpC beta-lactamases or carbapenemases. S. maltophilia and A. baumanniii complex are rare cIAI pathogens, but can cause postoperative pneumonia among high-risk critically ill patients with cIAI.

Among gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus spp. is associated with increased morbidity in IAIs, but the effect on mortality is uncertain. Whereas the role of enterococci in high-risk patients is well documented, their role in cIAIs in low-risk patients is doubtful. Zhang et al. found by meta-analysis that anti-enterococcal regimens provide no improvement in cIAI treatment success, with similar mortality and adverse effects, in RCTs enrolling young patients with lower-risk community-acquired infections (median APACHE-II score, 6 points). Malignant disease, corticosteroid use, surgery, any antibiotic treatment, admission to an ICU, and an indwelling urinary catheter each predisposed patients with cIAI to a higher risk of enterococcal infection. The prevalence of enterococcal isolation was 2- to 5-fold higher from hospital-acquired IAIs.

Empiric anti-enterococcal therapy for cIAI is not necessary for most community-acquired infections, but is indicated in hospital-acquired IAIs and may be considered for immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients with sepsis and previous antimicrobial therapy lacking enterococcal coverage, or patients with valvular heart disease or intravascular prosthetics at high risk for endocarditis or blood-borne device-associated infection. The ideal regimen for high-risk patients is undetermined. E. faecalis is generally susceptible to ampicillin whereas E. faecium, encountered increasingly, is almost always ampicillin-resistant and 70% of strains are resistant to vancomycin. The first-line treatment of glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecium is vancomycin. Linezolid or daptomycin may be used to treat vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, but occasional resistance has been reported to both agents. The glyclcyclines also have useful activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^117LftZ5]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the current case series, daptomycin was shown to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the management of VRE UTIs. Because of the increasing prevalence of VRE infection and the limited treatment options available, we anticipate that management of VRE UTIs will continue to be challenging for the clinician. Based on our experience, we believe that daptomycin is a valuable treatment option for problematic UTIs. These findings must be confirmed in larger randomized clinical trials. However, despite the lack of data about therapeutic options for VRE UTIs and the intrinsic limitations of descriptive case reports, our positive experience with daptomycin may be of value to the clinical community.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci utilise antibiotic-enriched nutrients for intestinal colonisation [^111a1rpA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens and a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. These hospital-acquired pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge as they have intrinsic resistance to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and also have acquired resistance to many available antibiotics.

E. faecium and E. faecalis are responsible for 75% of enterococcal infections and are commonly associated with hospital outbreaks of invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis. E. faecalis was more virulent and more prevalent in healthcare-associated infections than E. faecium, however, the prevalence of E. faecium is increasing due to the rise of vancomycin-resistant and lactam-resistant E. faecium strains. E. faecium has higher levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance than E. faecalis, where 80% of E. faecium isolates are vancomycin-resistant compared to 10% of E. faecalis isolates. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium has gained attention as the World Health Organisation classified it as a high priority pathogen due to its unfavourable rankings in several criteria, including mortality, trends of resistance, transmissibility, preventability, treatability, and pipelines for new medicines and diagnostics.

### Resistance mechanisms, epidemiology, and approaches to screening for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in the health care setting [^112TbSi8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. Prompt identification of colonized patients combined with effective multifaceted infection control practices can reduce the transmission of VRE and aid in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Increasingly, the clinical microbiology laboratory is being asked to support infection control efforts through the early identification of potential patient or environmental reservoirs. This review discusses the factors that contribute to the rise of VRE as an important health care-associated pathogen, the utility of laboratory screening and various infection control strategies, and the available laboratory methods to identify VRE in clinical specimens.

### Emerging role of Enterococcus spp in catheter-related infections: biofilm formation and novel mechanisms of antibiotic resistance [^111MVZ7e]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2006). Low credibility.

Enterococci are gram-positive bacteria that are part of the normal human intestinal flora and can colonize the upper respiratory tract, biliary tract and vagina of otherwise healthy people. Although their virulence is relatively low, recently enterococci have emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens and are currently the 4th leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, including those associated with intravascular catheter and biliary stent implants. The frequent use of these medical devices is often associated with severe complications, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and biliary stent occlusions, because of microbial biofilm formation on the device surface. Furthermore, other than a high level of resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and aminoglycosides, a dramatic increase in vancomycin resistance of enterococci has been recently observed in most clinical settings. Clinical strains exhibiting novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to antimicrobials are frequently isolated. In addition, enterococci have a great ability to transmit these resistance traits to other species and even to other genera. Due to their associated morbidity and mortality, enterococcal infections related to medical devices currently represent a major challenge for clinicians, especially for the management of critically ill patients, resulting in prolonged hospitalization and additional health costs.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^114TwFBw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of third-generation cephalosporins on risk for VRE is likely due to their activity against nonenterococcal aerobic enteric flora, leading to decrease in resistance colonization, allowing colonization with VRE. Similarly, suppression of gastrointestinal anaerobic flora is the presumed mechanism for the association between metronidazole and VRE. This activity and suppression do not explain the lack of effect of other agents with similar or even broader spectra of activity such as clindamycin, β-lactamase–inhibitor combinations, and imipenem. Other researchers have suggested that the combination of enteric concentration of the antimicrobial agent and its spectrum of activity against competing microflora determines its likelihood to be a risk factor (Rice LB, unpub. data). In our study, the positive association between duration of quinolone treatment and VRE had borderline statistical significance and a small increased risk per day of treatment. This observation, which requires further validation, may have important clinical importance for patients treated for long durations.

Our findings highlight the diversity of mechanisms that enable VVE isolates to revert to their resistant state. While vancomycin-variable E. faecium typically make up a small percentage of the E. faecium strains isolated within the clinical environment, they have, in places, become the dominant clone. As VVE isolates become more common in the hospital environment it may be of interest to include whole genome long-read sequencing in surveillance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci to rapidly identify strains that are phenotypically susceptible to vancomycin but can potentially revert to high-level vancomycin resistance.

### Enterococcus faecium: evolution, adaptation, pathogenesis and emerging therapeutics [^115jhzUr]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecium colonizes humans and a wide range of animals, endures numerous stresses, resists antibiotic treatment and stubbornly persists in clinical environments. The widespread application of antibiotics in hospitals and agriculture has contributed to the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E.faecium, which causes many hospital-acquired infections. In this Review, we explore recent discoveries about the evolutionary history, the environmental adaptation and the colonization and dissemination mechanisms of E.faecium and vancomycin-resistant E.faecium. These studies provide critical insights necessary for developing novel preventive and therapeutic approaches against vancomycin-resistant E.faecium and also reveal the intricate interrelationships between the environment, the microorganism and the host, providing knowledge that is broadly relevant to how antibiotic-resistant pathogens emerge and endure.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci utilise antibiotic-enriched nutrients for intestinal colonisation [^114uQeZg]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment significantly disrupts the gut microbiome and promotes vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) intestinal colonisation. These disruptions cause the intestine to act as a reservoir for VRE that seed difficult-to-treat infections. Here we show that antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation increase the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decrease the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites. We show significant but incomplete suppression of VRE growth by individual short chain fatty acids that were decreased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes. However, mixtures of short chain fatty acids provide complete or near complete suppression of VRE growth. We show that VRE use most nutrients increased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes as carbon or nitrogen sources to support their growth, where Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis have some common and some distinct preferences for the use of these specific nutrients. Finally, we show that E. faecium and E. faecalis occupy overlapping but distinct nutrient-defined intestinal niches that promote high growth when cultured with each other and when cultured with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Our results demonstrate that VRE occupy distinct intestinal niches in the antibiotic-treated intestine, defined by their abilities to utilise specific enriched nutrients and their abilities to grow with reduced concentrations of inhibitory microbial metabolites.

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^112PuFM5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4	Microbiology

Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.

Mechanism of Action

Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.

Resistance

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

Interactions with Other Antibacterials

In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received CUBICIN at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

### Nosocomial infection with vancomycin-dependent enterococci [^116uWLfu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Vancomycin resistance is thought to be mediated primarily by the strain's acquiring the capacity to synthesize the cell wall by using D-alanine-D-lactate. In the first clinical reports of VDE infection, Fraimow et al. and Green et al. independently reported that D-alanyl-D-alanine supported the growth of a vancomycin-dependent E. faecalis strain and a vanB E. faecium strain, respectively; Sng et al. quantified the amount of D-alanyl-D-alanine required to support growth of their VDE strain. The phenomenon of vancomycin dependence may derive from the loss of a D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase in a VRE strain, which is then unable to survive unless vancomycin induces the production of D-alanine-D-lactate ligase. Previous reports and our experience (Figure 2) suggest that infecting strains of VRE make the transition in situ to a state of vancomycin dependence only after prolonged exposure to vancomycin.

Sixteen patients infected by enterococci dependent on vancomycin for growth have been reported. In every case with data reported on prior antimicrobial exposure, the patients had also received a glycopeptide, vancomycin, or teicoplanin. We sought to minimize the effect of control group bias by selecting as a control group concurrently hospitalized patients at risk for nosocomial infection with VRE or VDE but not infected with enterococci. We found that intense use of third-generation cephalosporins was the most important risk factor for both VDE and VRE when compared with the uninfected control group. This finding is in line with our recent observation of the striking commonality of risk factors for nosocomial colonization and infection with a diverse array of multiresistant pathogens, in particular, heavy exposure to third-generation cephalosporins. Selection pressure from broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents apears to promote nosocomial colonization with VRE, which, after prolonged exposure to vancomycin, may lead to the emergence of vancomycin dependence in the colonizing strain.

### Infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistant to linezolid [^114b6F8r]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Linezolid is a new oxazolidinone antibiotic used to treat infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In early clinical trials, emergence of resistance occurred rarely. We report clinical details and antibiotic susceptibility from five patients treated with linezolid for VRE infections who had resistant organisms isolated during therapy. Four were transplant patients receiving protracted courses of the drug; three cases were associated with treatment failure. One of 45 linezolid-treated patients developed resistance during therapy. Susceptibility testing should be done in all cases on starting therapy.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^113vdGp9]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society revised guidelines — anti-enterococcal and anti-staphylococcal agents: Consider use of ampicillin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of susceptible enterococcal strains in higher-risk adults and children (Grade 2-B). Consider use of vancomycin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in higher risk adults and children (Grade 2-B). Include vancomycin in aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). Consider use of linezolid or daptomycin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) and as an alternative to vancomycin for infections from MRSA in adults and children (Grade 2-B).
