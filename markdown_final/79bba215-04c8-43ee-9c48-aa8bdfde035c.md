## Question

For a patient with a wound on the right medial buttock with tunneling to a depth of 7 cm and concern for a vesicocutaneous fistula, what imaging should I order? I was planning a CT of the pelvis with IV contrast plus a fistulogram of the right medial buttock — would that be appropriate, or is there a better option?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging to order for a 7 cm deep tunneling wound on the right medial buttock with suspected vesicocutaneous fistula, and whether a CT pelvis with IV contrast plus a fluoroscopic fistulogram is appropriate or if there is a better option to confirm bladder communication and delineate the tract. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key diagnostic objectives: confirming urinary communication, delineating the entire tract, and localizing the bladder entry site. Then, I should verify what current high-credibility guidelines recommend for urinary fistula and lower urinary tract leak imaging. Next, I will examine the strengths and limitations of the proposed tests versus CT cystography and MRI, including practical protocol details. Finally, I will synthesize a stepwise, evidence-based imaging plan and flag any necessary corrections in technique or sequence based on the clinical scenario and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem: a deep buttock tract with suspected vesicocutaneous communication implies a complex cutaneous fistula potentially arising from the bladder, where imaging must both prove urine leakage and define anatomy for operative planning, noting that urinary fistulas often present subtly and can be missed on routine exams or cystoscopy alone, making cross-sectional imaging crucial in complex cases [^111TgsBn] [^112HxxmS] [^112HxxmS].

> I will now examine the proposed plan of a standard CT pelvis with IV contrast plus a fluoroscopic sinogram of the buttock opening; wait, let me verify the diagnostic yield of each component in urinary fistulas, because portal venous phase CT without bladder opacification frequently misses small leaks, and sinography is 2D and may not show deep pelvic anatomy or the bladder entry point; indeed, fluoroscopic fistulography can confirm a tract but lacks comprehensive cross-sectional evaluation of extraluminal complications or the precise vesical defect, which is a known limitation in complex fistulas [^115qgw12] [^112F81oA].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed imaging for suspected bladder injury or fistula; the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend pelvic CT with bladder contrast, that is CT cystography, or fluoroscopic retrograde cystography when lower urinary tract injury is suspected, directly opacifying the bladder lumen to detect extravasation, a principle that applies to urinary fistulas as well, while the EAU 2025 guidance advises contrast-enhanced CT with late excretory phase and MRI when the diagnosis is challenging or when additional detail is needed for planning, reinforcing that bladder-targeted opacification and 3D mapping are preferred in complex cases [^115qgw12] [^111FgJf7] [^116uwcp2] [^112JwwUd] [^111TgsBn].

> Based on that, the primary study should be CT cystography using retrograde filling via Foley catheter to distend and opacify the bladder, because this directly demonstrates a bladder wall defect and outlines any extravasated contrast along the tract in 3D; let me consider a practical protocol: retrograde instillation of dilute iodinated contrast with adequate bladder distention followed by thin-slice CT acquisition, and when feasible, simultaneous CT fistulography by gently injecting dilute contrast into the cutaneous opening to create a one-stop shop for mapping; this approach is consistent with ACR principles and supported by MDCT cystography experience outside trauma, with Cystografin as an approved agent for cystography when appropriate [^115qgw12] [^116uwcp2] [^112HxxmS] [^117P5Y42] [^114n4msp].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I mentioned an "excretory phase" delay; hold on, I should verify whether that is actually required for CT cystography, because excretory phase belongs to CT urography, whereas CT cystography relies on retrograde bladder filling and immediate acquisition; I should correct that here: excretory phase is not mandatory for CT cystography, though optional delayed images can be added if there is diagnostic uncertainty or when combining with CT urography to assess the ureters in selected scenarios, so the core of the study remains retrograde bladder opacification with adequate distention and thin-section imaging [^112HxxmS] [^115qgw12].

> Let me think about why CT cystography outperforms a standard IV-contrast CT for this question; direct bladder opacification sensitively detects small leaks, depicts the precise vesical defect, and shows the extent and direction of contrast extravasation into pelvic and buttock soft tissues in three dimensions, all of which are critical for operative planning and are often missed by routine portal venous phase CT without intravesical contrast, especially in small or contained leaks [^115qgw12] [^116uwcp2].

> Next, I should review MRI's role; MRI pelvis provides superior soft tissue contrast, shows tract walls, surrounding inflammation, abscesses, and relationships to pelvic floor structures without radiation, and is first-line for complex perianal disease in GI guidelines, with practical protocol points including small field-of-view T2-weighted imaging and moderate bladder distention; importantly, MRI has mapped long vesicocutaneous tracts in case literature when CT or conventional testing was inadequate, supporting its complementary role when diagnostic uncertainty persists or when detailed preoperative anatomy is essential, or when ionizing radiation should be minimized [^113brWTW] [^116RCps9] [^113brWTW].

> I should double-check when simpler tests suffice; for straightforward, short fistulas, a micturating cystourethrogram can demonstrate the communication, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this case is a 7 cm deep tract at the buttock with suspected bladder origin, so complexity and depth favor cross-sectional imaging such as CT cystography and often MRI for surgical planning, consistent with contemporary case-based recommendations [^116RCps9].

> Now, let me compare this against the original plan; a standard CT pelvis with IV contrast may show inflammation but frequently fails to opacify the bladder or demonstrate small leaks, and an isolated fluoroscopic sinogram visualizes only the superficial tract without deep pelvic anatomy or the vesical defect; to ensure we do not underestimate disease, the plan should be upgraded to CT cystography, optionally combined with CT fistulography for one-session mapping, reserving MRI for problem-solving, complex soft tissue definition, or radiation-sensitive patients, which aligns with ACR and EAU guidance [^115qgw12] [^116uwcp2] [^112JwwUd] [^112F81oA] [^114n4msp].

> Before finalizing, I need to ensure adjunctive diagnostic steps are considered; cystoscopy with retrograde bladder filling using colored fluid can help localize an intravesical opening when needed, and in rare, persistently elusive cases, directed dye tests can assist localization, but these should complement, not replace, cross-sectional imaging in a complex tract like this [^114hTUut] [^117SsUyz].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to perform CT cystography with retrograde intravesical contrast as the first-line study to demonstrate bladder communication and map the fistulous course; if CT cystography is negative yet clinical suspicion remains high, or if detailed soft tissue relationships are crucial for operative strategy, proceed to pelvic MRI with small field-of-view T2-weighted sequences and moderate bladder distention; the original plan should be modified by avoiding a standard IV-contrast CT alone and by not relying on an isolated fluoroscopic fistulogram, given their limitations in complex urinary fistulas [^115qgw12] [^116uwcp2] [^112JwwUd] [^1164pjwb] [^112F81oA].

For a suspected vesicocutaneous fistula, **CT cystography is the preferred initial imaging** because it directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication [^112HxxmS] and is recommended by ACR for suspected bladder injury or fistula [^116uwcp2] [^115qgw12]. MRI pelvis is the **best adjunct** [^112JwwUd] for detailed soft-tissue mapping of complex or deep tracts, especially with a 7 cm tunnel [^1164pjwb], and is superior to standard CT for fistula anatomy and surgical planning. CT pelvis with IV contrast alone is less sensitive for fistula detection [^115qgw12], and a fistulogram is optional if the external opening is accessible [^112F81oA]. Cystoscopy can confirm the internal opening if needed [^114hTUut].

## Recommended imaging studies

| **Imaging modality** | **Indication** | **Technique** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| CT cystography | Suspected vesicocutaneous fistula or bladder injury [^116uwcp2] [^115qgw12] | Retrograde bladder filling with dilute iodinated contrast, then CT acquisition [^112HxxmS] | Directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication, detects leaks, and defines tract course [^112HxxmS] | Limited soft-tissue detail; may miss small or complex tracts [^1164pjwb] |
| MRI pelvis | Complex or deep fistula tracts, detailed soft-tissue mapping, surgical planning [^112JwwUd] [^116RCps9] | Multiplanar T2-weighted and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences [^1164pjwb] | Superior soft-tissue contrast, precise tract mapping, and detection of associated abscesses or inflammation [^113oTWRq] | Longer acquisition time, higher cost, and limited availability [^112JwwUd] |

### CT pelvis with IV contrast

CT pelvis with IV contrast is **indicated** for general pelvic evaluation and detection of abscesses or collections [^114n4msp], but its **limitations** include lower sensitivity for direct fistula visualization compared with CT cystography or MRI [^112HxxmS].

---

### Fistulogram

A fistulogram is **indicated** to directly visualize the fistula tract from the external opening [^112F81oA], but its **limitations** include invasiveness, limited soft-tissue detail, and incomplete delineation of complex tracts [^114n4msp].

---

## Recommended imaging sequence for this patient

Given the clinical scenario of a right medial buttock wound with a 7 cm tunneling tract suspicious for vesicocutaneous fistula, **the following imaging sequence is recommended**:

| **Step** | **Imaging modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CT cystography | Initial imaging to confirm bladder-to-skin communication and identify the internal opening [^116uwcp2] [^115qgw12] |
| 2 | MRI pelvis | Adjunct imaging to precisely map the complex tract, assess soft-tissue involvement, and plan surgical intervention [^112JwwUd] [^116RCps9] |
| 3 | Cystoscopy (optional) | Direct visualization of the internal opening if CT cystography is inconclusive [^114hTUut] |
| 4 | Fistulogram (optional) | If the external opening is accessible, to further delineate the tract [^112F81oA] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

CT cystography is the **preferred initial imaging study** for suspected vesicocutaneous fistula because it directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication [^112HxxmS] and is recommended by the ACR [^116uwcp2]. MRI pelvis is the **best adjunct** for detailed soft-tissue mapping of complex or deep tracts, especially with a 7 cm tunnel [^112JwwUd]. CT pelvis with IV contrast alone is less sensitive for fistula detection [^112HxxmS]; a fistulogram is optional if the external opening is accessible, and cystoscopy can confirm the internal opening if needed [^112F81oA] [^114hTUut].

Cross-sectional imaging techniques

- **MRI indications and protocol**: MRI arguably represents the best imaging modality to visualize normal pelvic and perineal structures, including the anal sphincter muscles, and to elucidate suspected vaginal disorders. Its strength lies in the ability to identify acute inflammatory changes, abscesses, post-surgical fibrosis, and neoplastic tissue. Therefore, if allowed by the patient's clinical conditions, MRI is the preferred imaging modality for investigating suspected urethro-, vesico-, ano-, and recto-vaginal fistulas. The most recent European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines recommend MRI as the first-line, most accurate modality for preoperative diagnosis of perianal involvement in Crohn's disease, as it significantly affects medical and surgical therapy planning and improves outcome.

Apart from fasting for some hours before examination, generally no special bowel preparation is required before MRI. However, some centers suggest that preliminary distension with ultrasound gel may ease identification of the vagina. Ideally, the urinary bladder should be moderately distended. Patients are scanned in the supine position, with a phased-array coil placed at the height of the pubic symphysis.

The MRI acquisition protocol adopted on our clinical 1.5 T MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips, the Netherlands) mostly relies on multiplanar T2-weighted images with a limited field-of-view. In the setting of known or suspected perianal inflammatory disease, axial and coronal images are obtained for thorough evaluation.

### Multidetector CT cystography for imaging colovesical fistulas and iatrogenic bladder leaks [^112HxxmS]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) cystography currently represents the modality of choice to image the urinary bladder in traumatized patients. In this review, we present our experience with MDCT cystography applications outside the trauma setting, particularly for diagnosing bladder fistulas and leaks. A detailed explanation is provided concerning exam preparation, acquisition technique, image reconstruction, and interpretation. Colovesical fistulas most commonly occur as a complication of sigmoid diverticular disease and often remain occult after an extensive diagnostic work-up, including cystoscopy and contrast-enhanced CT. We consistently achieved accurate preoperative visualization of colovesical fistulas using MDCT cystography.

Urinary leaks and injuries represent a non-negligible occurrence after pelvic surgery, particularly obstetric and gynecological procedures; in our experience, MDCT cystography is useful to investigate iatrogenic bladder leaks or fistulas. In our opinion, MDCT cystography should be recommended as the first-line modality for direct visualization or otherwise confident exclusion of both spontaneous enterovesical fistulas and bladder injuries following instrumentation procedures, obstetric, or surgical interventions.

- **Sentence case**: Preoperative visualization of colovesical fistulas, usually secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis.
- **Sentence case**: Visualization or exclusion of iatrogenic bladder injuries.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^115tuoij]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Sinus tracts differ from vaginal fistulas (VF) in that they do not connect to an organ, but instead are blind-ending or terminate into an abscess collection. Rare conditions that may mimic a VF both clinically and at imaging are peritoneal and lymphatic fistulas. In such cases, communication is established between the vaginal dome and a post-operative fluid or lymph collection. Differentiation relies on the correct identification of the abnormal collection that does not fill with enhanced urine.

CT images (a, b) show a fluid-filled dilatation of the vagina (arrows) communicating via a fistula (thin arrow in b) with an ovoid fluid-attenuation pelvic collection (* in b) consistent with a postoperative lymphocele.

### Diagnosis and treatment of enterovesical fistulae [^112Zt33S]. Colorectal Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Enterovesical fistulae are a recognized complication of a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Despite advances in imaging and treatment, the diagnosis may be delayed and management remains diverse. We describe our experience with their diagnosis and management.

This retrospective study encompassed all patients referred over a 10-year period with clinical suspicion of or confirmed enterovesical fistula. Demographics, clinical presentation, aetiology, and clinical outcome were evaluated. The mean follow-up was 18 months (range 6–50 months).

Thirty patients were studied. The mean age was 63.5 years (range 23–92 years). Fifteen (50%) patients presented with classical urinary symptoms such as pneumaturia, faecaluria, and urinary tract infections. The commonest investigations, with the number and percentage positive, included CT (15, 80%), cystoscopy (16, 87.5%), endoscopy (11, 54.5%), and barium enema (8, 50%). There were 20 inflammatory and 10 neoplastic aetiologies. Five patients were treated conservatively and 25 patients underwent surgery. Surgery resulted in symptomatic cure in the majority of cases (22/25).

Classical urinary symptoms were only evident in 50% of patients with confirmed fistulae. We advocate CT scanning as the optimum imaging modality before surgical intervention. Surgical treatment in a specialized unit remains the most effective treatment of enterovesical fistulae.

### Guided treatment improves outcome of patients with enterocutaneous fistulas [^114uBWNh]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Various techniques were used to diagnose the enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) and specify the anatomical origin. In some patients, the intestine was already partially visible in the abdominal wound, or macroscopic analysis of fistula fluid was possible. Bilirubin and amylase concentrations in wound fluid were measured in 17 patients. Radiological examination was performed in 24 patients, and a combination of both methods was used in 38 patients. In ten of these cases, the ECF was diagnosed after oral ingestion of methylene blue. Radiological examination was performed by fistulography in 14 patients and by CT imaging in another 48. Radiological imaging of the ECF and abdomen occurred in almost all patients undergoing a restorative operation (n = 45, 92%), all ultimately by computed tomography.

Because of the high risk of postoperative complications, evidenced by previous intra-abdominal operations, we refrained from performing a restorative operation in one patient, allowing the ECF to persist. An indwelling drain made the ECF properly manageable for this patient. Ultimately, conservative management achieved spontaneous closure in 23 patients (29%) compared to 19 patients (16%) in the previous series (p = 0.023) following a median period of convalescence of 39 days (range 7–163) compared with a median of 18 days (range 7–49; p = 0.007). Conservative closure was achieved predominantly in patients with a closed abdominal wall and/or large bowel ECF.

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^112F81oA]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Fistulography, also known as sinography, has traditionally been the primary technique for investigating enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) and remains useful as a complementary technique to confirm communication between the external fistulous opening (EFO) and a segment of the gastrointestinal tract. In our experience, this technique is best performed with the help of the referring surgeon, who probes the EFO and enters the ECF. Depending on its calibre, various tools such as a venous cannula, angiographic needle, standard syringe, Foley-type catheter, or a pediatric or nasogastric feeding tube may be used. Subsequently, a non-forceful manual injection of low-osmolar water-soluble iodinated contrast medium (CM) is performed under fluoroscopic observation.

This procedure is inexpensive, rapid, and easy to conduct, providing direct visualisation of the communicating small bowel (see Fig. 1 A, B) or colonic segment (see Fig. 1 C). It offers valuable information on ECF anatomy such as calibre, length, course, and ramifications. However, false-negative results might occur due to oedema, debris, or compression by abscesses or masses that impede CM flow into the intestinal lumen. Despite its utility, fistulography does not provide cross-sectional visualisation of mural and extraluminal pathology upstream, downstream, and at the site of the ECF.

### Differentiation of perianal fistulas with digital subtraction magnetic resonance fistulography [^1165u8nn]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accurate in identifying perianal fistulas. The exact visualization of fistulous tracts and concomitant abscesses determines the type of treatment. To improve the detection of perianal fistulas, we studied digital subtraction MR-fistulography for tissue differentiation based on signal intensity measurements.

- **Methods**: This study included 75 patients with the clinical diagnosis of perianal fistula. All patients were analyzed by a thin-slice, high-resolution, fast low-angle shot 3-dimensional sequence in the axial plane before and after intravenous injection of gadobenate dimeglumine, followed by image subtraction. Operator-defined regions of interest were used to calculate signal intensities of the inflamed fibrous walls of fistulas, the common femoral artery, the internal and external sphincter muscles, and the gluteus muscle. The fistulas were classified according to the Parks classification.

- **Results**: Based on signal intensity measurements in 75 patients with perianal fistulas diagnosed by digital subtraction MR-fistulography, a significant differentiation between fistulous tracts and anatomic structures was possible. MRI identified 116 perianal fistulas (34 intersphincteric, 33 transsphincteric, 10 suprasphincteric, and 39 extrasphincteric) and 35 abscesses.

- **Conclusions**: Digital subtraction MR-fistulography is a new, promising, noninvasive imaging technique for the detection of perianal fistulas and abscesses.

Patients more often have a history of irradiation, but there have been cases observed without it too. Both conservative management and surgery have been used to treat such fistulae. To our knowledge, there is no published report on the surgical technique used to treat enteropouch fistulae. We report a novel intraoperative technique to identify non-visible fistulae.

### Volume assessment magnetic resonance imaging technique for monitoring perianal Crohn's fistulas [^117SBQcY]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pelvic MRI has been shown to be the most accurate method for classification of the primary tract and secondary extensions; the recognition and treatment of the latter being essential to ensure satisfactory healing. MRI scans inform clinicians about fistula complexity, for example, the number of tracts, presence of undrained sepsis, and the patients' response to treatment interventions. Importantly, MRI can evaluate deep tissue healing, which cannot be clinically assessed.

Assessment of radiological improvement is subjective, and wide variation exists between radiologists. Previous attempts to standardize radiological response, such as the Van Assche system, have been criticized due to insensitivity to change and represent descriptive scores rather than monitoring tools. Currently, there is no universally accepted or reliable method of monitoring long-term radiological response to treatment. However, it is our view that clinical monitoring alone is inadequate. Proper evaluation of interventions for perianal Crohn's fistula requires accurate monitoring of response, as does the development of tools that will enable prediction of successful treatment. Future research and development therefore need to focus on accurate forms of imaging to provide standardized, responsive, and accurate tools to assess radiological response to treatment.

The imaging module of the recently published fistulising CD core outcome set comprises two outcomes: 'Fistula response on imaging' and 'an activity-based MRI score responsive to change'. At present, perianal fistula complexity on MRI is judged based on these outcomes.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: a case report [^116RCps9]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Vesicocutaneous fistulas rarely communicate to the thigh but commonly exit the perineum, scrotum, buttocks, or hypogastrium. The time for the fistula to develop can vary but usually precedes an abscess. We believe our patient did not leak urine because the fistula tract was blocked by the foreign body.

For simple fistulas, a micturating cystourethrogram can be sufficient, but in cases where the history is prolonged and the fistula is complex, a CT or an MRI is needed, as evident in our case where the history was long and the presentation was rather uncommon.

- **Management**: Depends on the presenting symptoms, the complexity of the fistula, and the underlying cause. Urinary diversion to reduce the hydrostatic pressure of the bladder is vital. Therefore, a urethral catheter was kept for 21 days in our case. However, fistula excision surgery was not needed as the tract healed spontaneously after removal of the foreign object (causal agent). VCF can also be managed surgically by fistulectomy with vacuum-assisted closure, or larger and complex fistulas may require musculocutaneous flap surgery.

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^114n4msp]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Nowadays, the vast majority of patients should undergo CT or MRI studies to provide comprehensive cross-sectional information on ECFs and underlying disorders, serving as a consistent basis for appropriate treatment choice and planning. Multidetector CT is preferred in uncooperative or severely ill patients, such as those in early postoperative hospitalization, because it obtains high-spatial resolution images in seconds, thus limiting motion or peristalsis artifacts. In the setting of ECF, intravenous CM is warranted unless contraindicated.

Orally administered CM opacification may be helpful in patients with scarce intra-abdominal fat, to ease differentiation of bowel loops from extraluminal structures and abnormal collections. Unfortunately, most patients who recently underwent surgery have ileus or obstruction and are unable to drink diluted CM. Alternatively, CT-fistulography (Fig. 2), with prior injection of iodinated CM such as 3% diluted iopamidol or iohexol through the EFO, represents a useful one-stop-shop technique, which combines cross-sectional information with opacification of the involved bowel tract. Image reconstruction and study interpretation along the sagittal plane are strongly recommended, as it provides the best visualization of the ventral abdominal wall.

### Utero-cutaneous fistula following caesarean section [^111gM4NX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A multiparous woman in her 20s presented to the clinic with bleeding from a caesarean scar site. After clinical examination and radiological evaluation with ultrasound and MR fistulogram, the diagnosis was utero-cutaneous fistula. Complete resection of the fistulous tract with uterine defect closure and supportive omental patch placement was performed following an intraoperative demonstration of the utero-cutaneous fistula by injecting methylene blue dye. Utero-cutaneous fistula is a rare complication after caesarean section. Cyclical bleeding from an abnormal opening in the previous caesarean scar site is the classical presentation of this condition.

### High resolution MRI for preoperative work-up of neonates with an anorectal malformation: a direct comparison with distal pressure colostography/fistulography [^112g1QmH]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Since an MRI examination is static (non-operator dependent) and images can always be re-evaluated and discussed with different physicians, MRI can produce more consistent results. Moreover, reconstructions and one-to-one comparisons of images from various angles can be done at any moment. Very high-resolution sequences also allow multiplane reconstructions that provide additional insight into complicated anatomic anomalies.

Inter-reader agreement of conventional imaging was moderate to substantial, whereas MRI yielded perfect agreement. The main drawback in the interpretation of conventional imaging was the difficulty in differentiating prostatic from bulbar recto-urethral fistulas. This can be challenging since the location of the pelvic floor was not always clearly interpretable. Neither MRI reader had any difficulty in discerning these two entities, as adjacent structures such as the prostate made differentiation straightforward. Operative techniques have evolved in recent years, and most bulbar recto-urethral fistulas with a rectal pouch at the pelvic floor are now treated with PSARP, whereas higher fistulas such as prostatic recto-urethral fistulas are more likely to be operated using LAARP. This development has made differentiation between these two ARM entities increasingly relevant for clinical practice. In light of the data presented here, we conclude that local anatomy is more precisely presented for surgical planning when using MRI compared to colostography/fistulography.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^1167Rjo7]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Fistulas of the female genital tract have been described in medical literature since ancient times. Among them, vaginal fistulas (VF) are the most prevalent and are defined as abnormal epithelium-lined communications between the vagina and other pelvic organs. The spectrum of causes includes congenital and developmental abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, infections, tumors, sexual and obstetric trauma, irradiation, and post-surgical injuries. Regardless of the underlying disorder, all VFs result in substantial morbidity and severely impair patients' quality of life.

The majority of patients with VF are initially referred to a gynecologist. However, despite more or less evident clinical signs, vaginal exploration may identify the fistulous orifice in less than 80% of cases. Similarly, visualization of the abnormal communication is generally quite challenging at either ano-proctoscopy or urethro-cystoscopy. As a result, clinicians and surgeons need critical help from radiologists to confirm the presence of a VF, visualize its site, course, and involved organs, and characterize the underlying pathology.

Traditionally, imaging demonstration of VF relied on fluoroscopic studies such as contrast medium (CM) enema, intravenous excretory urography, voiding, and retrograde cystography, which may opacify a patent fistulous tract but provide very limited information on the affected organs. Although developed as the best radiographic technique to confirm and visualize a VF by pressure, conventional vaginography is relatively invasive and cumbersome.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^112NdMY3]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

The group encountered some difficulty when it came to indicating the size of any extension encountered since their morphology is variable. While volume measurements may circumvent this, volume is used rarely in daily clinical practice and is less familiar to surgeons. Ultimately, we settled on maximal diameter as the best compromise. This issue is similar to the distinction between an "abscess" and a "track/tract" because there is no generally accepted definition that differentiates between the two. Ultimately, accurate identification and location of sepsis is more important than the precise term used to describe it. There was also some discussion as to whether the maximal diameter of an extension should be restricted to its cavity or include any fibrous wall. Members decided that cavity measurement best reflected the need for treatment, for example, surgical drainage.

First-round consensus failed for a statement regarding fistula "activity". A number of recent publications have considered activity, notably in patients with Crohn's fistulas. The concept of activity is well established for enteric Crohn's disease, and when applied to fistula-in-ano, is defined as inflammatory activity within the fistula reflected, for example, by T2 hyperintensity and/or enhancement following gadolinium contrast. While authors of these articles considered the topic important, other group members reported that their surgeons/gastroenterologists did not find this concept useful, being more concerned with whether a fistula was present or not, and its morphology. Ultimately, the group achieved consensus.

On exploration of the sinus, an incision was made around the fistula externally, a few centimeters from the center, and extended upwards about 2 cm. A foreign body was detected with forceps, projecting towards the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder through muscle layers. Upon controlled division and layered dissection, a round old piece of wood measuring about 7 cm long, with an estimated diameter of 6 mm, was extracted with no calcifications around it (Fig. 4). The fistula tract was curated and debrided, thoroughly lavaged, hemostasis was achieved, and the wound was dressed aseptically. A tissue sample from the fistula tract was taken for histological analysis, confirming pyogenic granuloma with no features of metastasis.

### High resolution MRI for preoperative work-up of neonates with an anorectal malformation: a direct comparison with distal pressure colostography/fistulography [^1147EWAB]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

MRI failed to make the correct diagnosis in four cases: a rectovaginal H-fistula, an anal stenosis, a vestibular fistula (insufficient image quality), and a bulbar recto-urethral fistula (closed bulbar recto-urethral fistula misdiagnosed as no fistula with the rectal pouch below the pelvic floor).

Colostography/fistulography was incorrect in 13 cases: five bulbar recto-urethral fistulas (four misinterpreted as prostatic urethral fistulas [Fig. 3]), three with no fistula, two prostatic urethral fistulas (one misinterpreted as a rectobulbar rectourethral fistula, one uninterpretable [Fig. 1]), one cloaca, one rectovaginal H-fistula, and one anal stenosis.

The level of the rectal pouch was misinterpreted in four cases using MRI compared to surgery: one vestibular fistula with a fistula at the level of the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as a lower-level fistula, one bulbar level with an obliterated fistula at the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as no fistula with a rectal pouch below the pelvic floor, one bulbar fistula with a rectal pouch on the level of the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as a bulbar fistula with a rectal pouch above the pelvic floor, and finally, one vestibular fistula with a fistula below the pelvic floor could not be interpreted with MRI.

The reasons for the misinterpretation of the level of the rectal pouch when colostography/fistulography was used were diverse. The failure of colostography/fistulography to determine the length of the common channel in a cloaca was due to an uninterpretable image.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^112TJ9mA]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

As noted in the "Introduction", the primary target audience for this guideline are radiologists interpreting medical imaging for the diagnosis of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis. The group anticipates that these guidelines can be implemented rapidly in clinical practice since they predominantly describe MRI techniques and interpretation practices that are already in widespread clinical use. In particular, there is no specified requirement for specialized equipment. Rather, this guideline describes a "minimum dataset" for image acquisition and reporting.

Using a modified Delphi approach, we achieved consensus for 53 individual statements relating to the imaging of potential anal sepsis, notably fistula-in-ano. These guidelines cover 10 areas of interest.

- **Clinical indications**: While this exercise was precipitated by a desire for guidelines around imaging fistula-in-ano, it is clear that imaging, notably MRI, is appropriate to investigate several other pathologies that may also cause anal sepsis. In some cases, a differential diagnosis between fistula-in-ano and another pathology (e.g. pilonidal sinus) may be required, whereas in others, imaging is highly effective for the diagnosis of life-threatening pathology, notably necrotizing fasciitis (where free tissue gas is especially well demonstrated by CT). In Crohn's disease, imaging can also be used to direct and optimize treatment strategy and to monitor the efficacy of this.

Several research studies have been performed that investigate the effect of imaging in the context of potential anal sepsis.

### Multidisciplinary approach to evaluation of rectovaginal fistulas [^114Yk6KG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Thorough evaluation of a rectovaginal fistula is essential to optimizing surgical repair. The underlying cause should be addressed and treated, as it can affect the timing and approach to repair. It is imperative to be well prepared because the highest chance of successful closure occurs during the initial repair attempt.

Our objective was to demonstrate how multidisciplinary colorectal surgery and urogynecology teams use specific methods during the examination under anesthesia to evaluate a complex rectovaginal fistula and optimize the surgical approach to repair. Anesthesia may be provided with monitored anesthesia care and a posterior perineal block. This pain control allows for a wide range of techniques to evaluate the fistula using anoscopy, a fistula probe, hydrogen peroxide, and sigmoidoscopy.

In addition, the teams show how curettage and subsequent seton placement can encourage closure by secondary intention and decrease the risk of abscess formation, respectively.

### Diagnostic lessons learnt from a series of enterovesical fistulae [^116eSCxJ]. Colorectal Disease (2002). Low credibility.

An enterovesical fistula (EVF) is an uncommon condition that requires careful and sometimes extensive preoperative investigation. Our experience over a 10-year period has been reviewed, with an emphasis on the diagnostic investigations performed.

Forty-two patients (30 male) have been studied, focusing on their presenting symptoms, diagnostic investigations, and subsequent treatment.

- **Results**: The sites of the fistulae were as follows: 37 colonic, 2 rectal, and 3 ileal. The most common presenting symptoms were pneumaturia (75%), faecaluria (63%), and urinary tract infections (57%). The positivity rate of the investigations performed included cystoscopy (89%), urine cytology (86%), barium enema (65%), computerized tomography (CT) scanning (55%), intravenous pyelogram (IVP) (35%), and cystography (27.5%). The causes of the fistulae were primarily due to diverticular disease (71%), carcinoma (20%), Crohn's disease (7%), and radiotherapy (2%).

- **Conclusion**: We recommend cystoscopy and urine cytology for faecal material as the first-line investigations in all patients with a suspected enterovesical fistulae. CT scanning and barium enema should not be first-line investigations but may be performed subsequently to help determine the aetiology and plan of surgery.

### Colonic acquired fistulae: The potential of CT colonography [^113sMsAj]. Academic Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of colonic fistulae is crucial in defining the best therapeutic approach. Fistulae can be suspected from clinical history or specific symptoms, but imaging plays a key role in confirming the diagnosis. Previous studies described conventional methods with barium as the choice for the diagnosis; more recently, intestinal ultrasound, CT, and MR have been considered promising tests. CT colonography is the best radiologic test to evaluate the colon, although only a few case reports have described its role in this setting. The aim of this paper is to highlight the potential of CT colonography in evaluating patients with suspected colonic fistulae.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^113oTWRq]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal fistulas represent abnormal communications between the vagina and either the distal portion of the digestive system or the lower urinary tract, but lack an accepted classification and standardized terminology. Regardless of the underlying cause, these uncommon disorders result in profound physical, psychological, sexual, and social distress to the patients.

Since the diagnosis of vaginal fistulas is challenging at gynecologic examination, ano-proctoscopy, and urethro-cystoscopy, imaging is crucial to confirm the fistula, visualize its site, course, and involved organ, and to characterize the underlying disease. Traditional conventional radiographic studies provided limited cross-sectional information and are nowadays largely replaced by CT and MRI studies.

This pictorial paper aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with vaginal fistulas by summarizing their clinical features, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approach. It presents the appropriate CT and MRI acquisition and interpretation techniques that vary according to the anatomic site and termination of the fistula.

- **State-of-the-art CT and MRI**: The paper presents examples regarding both entero- (involving the colon, rectum, and anus) and urinary (connecting the bladder, distal ureter, or urethra) vaginal fistulas. The resulting combined anatomic and functional cross-sectional information is crucial to allow a correct therapeutic choice and surgical planning.

### High resolution MRI for preoperative work-up of neonates with an anorectal malformation: a direct comparison with distal pressure colostography/fistulography [^115tqrkX]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The MRI studies were prospectively and independently analyzed by two readers, both experienced staff members in pediatric and abdominal radiology, labeled as readers A and B. These readers were blinded to the surgical results. They were given clinically visible information regarding the anal opening to imitate clinical reality. Information from other diagnostic tools was not available during the reading sessions.

Colostography/fistulography was similarly analyzed by another two experienced staff members in pediatric radiology, labeled as readers X and Y, who were also blinded to the MRI or surgical results. The same information as in the MRI readings was provided.

- **Classification according to Krickenbeck**: Readers initially classified the imaging findings based on the Krickenbeck classification.
- **Evaluation of transition location**: They then evaluated the location where normal rectal mucosa transitioned into the fistula. This transition location was categorized as above, at, or below the level of the pelvic floor.

Since no pressure was applied during MRI to dilate the proximal colon, differentiation between the normal colon and the fistula relied on the visible layered aspect of the bowel segment. It was deemed normal bowel suitable for anastomosis if distinct layers (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis) were discernible. In contrast, if no layers were visible, it was classified as a fistula. Using colostography/fistulography, the non-dilated part of the distal bowel was classified as a fistula.

In patients with a cloacal malformation, the length of…

### Retrograde vaginal methylene blue injection for localization of complex urinary fistulas [^117SsUyz]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Ureterovesical and vesicovaginal fistulae are usually diagnosed using standard techniques, including radiology, the double-dye test, cystoscopy, and vaginal examination. In some complex cases, however, localizing the fistulous orifice can be extremely difficult.

- **Method**: We describe a novel technique of retrograde vaginal methylene blue testing that may assist in properly localizing the fistulous opening.

- **Results**: Our experience with one case each of ureterovesical and vesicovaginal fistula, easily diagnosed with this method, demonstrates its efficacy, simplicity, and safety.

- **Conclusion**: This technique should be reserved for cases of urinary fistulae when all standard diagnostic methods have failed.

Our study is the most comprehensive analysis of the burden of fistula at the time of writing, incorporating study sources not generally used. Our findings suggest that the prevalence and incidence of fistula are relatively low. The low burden of fistula should not detract from their public health importance, however, given the preventability of the condition and the devastating consequences of fistula. Future studies of fistula should include a description of the study population with defined denominators.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: a case report [^113brWTW]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

MR images of the pelvis and proximal right thigh show T2 and T2 fat saturation images. A fistulous tract, measuring 10 cm in length, contains a foreign body originating from the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder (images A and B). The tract passes through the obturator internus, obturator externus, adductor magnus, and gracilis muscles, exiting through the medial aspect of the right thigh (images D and E). Images C and F illustrate the foreign body in the fistulous tract, indicated by a blue arrow.

Laboratory workup showed hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, serum creatinine of 43 mmol/L, and BUN of 1.95 mmol/L, with serum potassium and sodium within range. The patient was scheduled for cystoscopy, exploration, and fistulectomy. Examination under anesthesia revealed normal-appearing external female genitalia and a 1 cm by 1 cm sinus on the upper thigh's inner aspect, characterized by an exophytic edge, pus discharge, and surrounding firm scar tissue (Fig. 2). Cystoscopy exposed a 2 cm by 2 cm mass located at 10 o'clock approximately 5 cm away from the trigone, which bled easily upon touch. The mass was resected from the wall using a monopolar TUR set, revealing the fistula opening (Fig. 3). A 2-way 16Fr Foley catheter was left in situ, and the tissue chips were sent for histopathology, which identified a pyogenic granuloma (Fig. 3).

### Management of the bladder during surgical treatment of enterovesical fistulas from benign bowel disease [^114MbwuR]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Management of the bladder in enterovesical fistulas from benign bowel disease is not well described in the literature, and there is no clear consensus.

- **Study design**: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients with benign bowel disease and an enterovesical fistula who underwent definitive surgical management between January 1993 and December 2005. Patients were excluded if they had any history of abdominal cancer or pelvic radiation. The surgical management protocol for enterovesical fistulas included a period of perioperative bowel rest, surgical exploration, separation of the fistulized bowel from the bladder, resection of the diseased bowel segment, and Foley catheter placement for one week.

- **Results**: Seventy-four patients were eligible for the study. The average patient age was 54.3 years, with a range from 19 to 88 years old. Twenty-six women and 48 men underwent celiotomy and segmental resection of the offending bowel and bowel side of the fistula. The bladder side of the fistula was managed by Foley catheter alone in 68% of cases and by surgical repair in 32%. Fifty-two patients had diverticulitis (70.3%), and 22 had Crohn's disease (29.7%). The mean follow-up was 26.4 months, while the median follow-up was 6.45 months. One patient developed colocutaneous and vesicocutaneous fistulas after celiotomy, but the remaining bladder defects healed within one week.

- **Conclusions**: Successful surgical management of most enterovesical fistulas from diverticulitis or Crohn's disease requires only the resection of the diseased bowel, with minimal need for repair or resection of the bladder side of the fistula.

### Selective use of cystogram following segmental bowel resection in patients with enterovesical fistula [^1142aSMT]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing resectional surgery for enterovesical fistulas generally have an indwelling urinary catheter postoperatively to prevent a refistula. The aim of this study was to assess the role of a cystogram as part of the postoperative follow-up for such surgery, determining when it should be performed and how long the bladder should be drained after surgery.

- **Method**: A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on all patients undergoing ileocaecal or sigmoid resection for enterovesical fistula, with the primary endpoint of reurinary fistula.

- **Results**: Between 1994 and 2015, 46 patients (23 males; mean age 55.4 ± 18.3 years) underwent surgery: 23 (50%) for diverticular disease, 16 (34.8%) for Crohn's disease, five (10.9%) for malignancy, and two (4.3%) for previous radiotherapy. Closure of the bladder fistula was achieved by simple suture in 21 (46%) patients and with an omental pedicle in 16 (36%). The overall median duration of urinary drainage was 10.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 7.3–14.0] days. A postoperative cystogram was performed in 26 (57%) patients following a median of 10.0 (IQR: 8.0–13.0) days. This demonstrated persistent leakage in three patients, two of whom had undergone surgical closure of the bladder. This group required prolonged drainage (7, 19, and 40 days). One patient, who had undergone surgery following radiotherapy for urothelial cancer, developed a remalignant fistula at 9 months, despite a negative postoperative cystogram.

This study suggests that a routine postoperative cystogram after surgery for enterovesical fistulas might not be necessary in every case.

### The development of a minimum dataset for MRI reporting of anorectal fistula: a multi-disciplinary, expert consensus process [^11645DTS]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for anal fistula. Details of fistula morphology are communicated through the radiology report, which should be unambiguous, relevant, and concise without placing unnecessary burden upon reporting radiologists. This is a challenge, as anal fistulae can be complex, and reporting requires a precise description of the spatial configuration of key features. Both free-text and structured reporting have advantages and disadvantages. A minimum dataset, a set of features that should be reported for all anal fistulae, can be used in either style, emphasizing items that are most valuable.

Successful treatment of anal fistula relies on accurate assessment of fistula anatomy, particularly in complex cases. Surgery guided by clinical examination alone has a higher risk of recurrence due to undetected tracts, with significantly improved outcomes when MRI is utilized. Studies have shown that the fistula recurrence rate is 13% when surgery is guided by MRI findings compared to 52% when there is discordance between imaging and clinical examination. Imaging further supports surgical decision-making for the use of sphincter-preserving procedures (SPPs). These minimally invasive techniques have variable efficacy and are usually favored where fistulotomy (requiring variable division of the sphincter muscles) is likely to result in continence disturbance. The feasibility of many SPPs is partly determined by specific anatomical features, such as tract tortuosity, diameter, and the presence of intersp…

### FIGO good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^115Gdu4A]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Utilizing established protocols to objectively assess surgical outcomes, assessment protocols on how to objectively measure the level of urinary incontinence have been developed and published, including freely accessible publications by prominent fistula surgeons. There is limited research reinforcing the effectiveness of such tools and their validity. However, the level of awareness about these resources and their use by the fistula community is unknown.

As approaches regarding how to determine surgical outcomes continue to be inconsistent, the aim of these good practice recommendations is to provide a detailed protocol with the objective of standardizing:

- **Assessment of surgical outcomes**: Following vesicovaginal fistula repair.
- **Interpretation of results**: The protocol seeks to establish a consensus on how to interpret surgical outcomes effectively.
- **Ongoing management of patients**: Continuous care and monitoring are essential for the long-term well-being of patients post-surgery.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^117TVm52]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Enterovaginal and enterovesical fistulae**: We recommend that enterovaginal and enterovesical fistulae should be managed jointly with medical control of inflammation and surgical resection (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence; agreement: 100%).

Data on the management of non-perianal fistulae, especially from randomised trials, are limited. There are even more limited data on the outcomes of patients treated for specifically entero-gynaecological or enterovesical fistulae. Although these fistulae are rare, they pose a serious problem to patients with Crohn's disease. A systematic literature review showed that response to medical therapy (fistula closure) was complete in 38.3% of rectovaginal fistulae and 65.9% of enterovesical fistulae. For enterovesical fistulae, risk factors for the need for surgical intervention include sigmoid origin and other complications of Crohn's disease, such as small bowel obstruction, abscess formation, other fistulation, ureteric obstruction, or urinary tract infection.

These authors suggest that enterovesical fistulae should be treated medically initially, with surgery reserved for those with bowel obstruction or abscess formation, non-responders, or recurrence after medical therapy. In a series of 47 patients with genital fistulae, antibiotics had no lasting benefit; thiopurines resulted in a 13% complete and 24% partial response, and anti TNF-alpha therapy gave a 17% complete and 30% partial response. Surgery was undertaken in a third of patients, but only 22% achieved complete response following a first operation and 39% after additional interventions.

### Figo good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^113VVo4s]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

Obstetric fistula is a debilitating childbirth injury causing immense suffering for women and girls with the condition. The majority of fistulas can be successfully treated with surgical repair performed by a competent surgeon who has undergone specialist training and who works with a holistic fistula care team.

As well as surgical repair, a critical component of fistula treatment is meticulous postoperative assessment to accurately determine surgical outcomes so that further treatment and support can be provided as required, reducing the risk substantially of any patient being discharged with associated ongoing problems such as urinary retention or residual/ongoing incontinence. Based on the opinions of experts in the field, these good practice recommendations provide a practical and standardized protocol for the correct assessment of surgical outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery and appropriate subsequent management.

Most patients with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) now undergo multidetector CT or MRI studies to provide a comprehensive cross-sectional assessment, which serves as a consistent basis for appropriate treatment choice and planning. Visualization of the underlying conditions, such as postoperative anastomotic leaks, bowel obstructions, abscesses amenable to drainage, active or stricturing Crohn's disease, and fistulizing or recurrent tumors, allows for directed treatment. This approach results in decreased rates of failed conservative management and a higher likelihood of therapeutic success.

These include Foley catheters, dye, Sims vaginal specula, different types of pads, and locally available scales to weigh the pad. Procuring any missing materials can also be explored in the treatment facility or with supporting partners.

	- Utilizing these good practice recommendations will provide clear direction to any fistula surgeon and care team assessing patients after vesicovaginal fistula repair. As the protocol details the necessary steps, actions, time periods, and materials needed, the costs per patient or assessment can easily be calculated and budgeted accordingly. Free print versions of the flowchart in A4 and A3 format in English, French, and Portuguese are available on the FIGO Fistula Resource Hub.

	- It is hoped that the use of this expert-recommended tool will enhance cost-effectiveness and treatment outcomes. It will reduce the risk of the surgeon inadvertently missing something critical during the assessment, which could lead to premature discharge of the patient and subsequent return visits for further investigations, if this is even possible.

### Vesicocutaneous fistula at site of closed suprapubic tube tract as the first presenting sign of giant bladder stone [^117DNcY8]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Bladder stones represent approximately 5% of all cases of urolithiasis and are typically identified and managed long before causing irreversible renal injury. We present a case of a man in his 40s with a prior history of a gunshot wound to the abdomen who presented with leakage from a previously healed suprapubic tube tract and was found to have a giant bladder stone with a resulting renal injury. He subsequently underwent a combined open cystolithotomy and vesicocutaneous fistulotomy during his hospitalisation, which helped to improve his renal function. In addition to there being few reported cases of bladder stones greater than 10 cm, this represents the first report in the literature of an associated decompressive 'pop-off' mechanism through a fistulised tract.

### A case of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh [^113KkXev]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a case of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh that developed 7 years after an injury to the pelvis. A 34-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital because of a water-soluble yellow exudate from his left thigh. A urinary fistula was suggested by the results of an intravenous indigo carmine injection. Intravenous pyelography and computed tomography revealed the presence of a bladder deformation and a fistula originating at the ventral bladder wall and leading down to the left thigh. The patient underwent fistulectomy and partial cystectomy. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh have been published.

### Concurrent vesicoperitoneal and vesicovaginal fistulae [^114X4Fxu]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Although rare in the United States, vesicovaginal fistulae are usually associated with postoperative complications. Even more rarely seen, vesicoperitoneal fistulae can also present postoperatively. Both types of fistulae pose diagnostic challenges and can be difficult to manage. We describe a case report of a patient with both vesicovaginal and vesicoperitoneal fistulae following a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, who presented with abdominal pain and anuria. Cystogram and outpatient cystoscopy were imperative in the diagnosis. She was conservatively managed with continuous bladder drainage via an indwelling catheter, resulting in an ideal recovery without requiring reoperation.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^117A4TRs]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Key points**: Vaginal fistulas are broadly categorized by their effect on either the distal bowel (sigmoid colon, rectus, anal canal) or the urinary tract (bladder, distal ureter, or urethra). Among the spectrum of causes, in Western countries, iatrogenic surgical injuries represent an increasing concern.

CT diagnosis of bowel vaginal fistulas benefits from small field-of-view oblique and sagittal interpretation, with optional intrarectal contrast. If not contraindicated, focused MRI provides superior visualization of ano- and rectovaginal fistulas. CT-urography and additional CT-cystography now represent the mainstay techniques to diagnose urinary vaginal fistulas.

### FIGO good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^113EFDQ5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

These good practice recommendations detail the steps required for an accurate assessment of surgical outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula repair and outline the options available for correct management of a variety of different outcomes. Based on expert opinion, it is anticipated that this protocol will lead to greater uptake and standardization for fistula surgeons and their care teams, as well as contribute to the further development of a common language to facilitate discussion of fistula patients and their treatment outcomes by the fistula community. Finally, and most importantly, it is hoped that these recommendations will result in more women being discharged following an accurate postoperative clinical assessment and with a correct and appropriate treatment plan in place.

### Vacuum-assisted closure of a vesicocutaneous fistula in a pediatric patient after bladder cystoplasty [^111rBjf7]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

A vesicocutaneous fistula is an abnormal communication from the bladder to the skin. Recently, wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) has been utilized to facilitate fistula closure. However, there are no reports of using VAC specifically for fistula closure in the pediatric population. We present a case of an adolescent patient who developed a vesicocutaneous fistula after bladder augment cystoplasty and was treated with VAC only.

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^112kMmJS]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) represent abnormal communications between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. Nowadays, the majority (approximately 80%) of ECFs develop secondary to abdominal surgeries. Alternatively, less common causes include chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease, tumors, and radiation enteritis, in descending order of frequency. These rare disorders require thorough patient assessment and multidisciplinary management to limit the associated morbidity and mortality.

This pictorial review includes an overview of the causes, clinical manifestations, complications, and management of ECFs. Following this, the imaging appearances, differential diagnoses, and therapeutic options of post-surgical, IBD-related, and malignant ECFs are presented with case examples. Most of the emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of CT and MRI, which comprehensively depict ECFs, providing cross-sectional information on the underlying post-surgical, neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory conditions. Radiographic fistulography remains a valid technique, rapidly depicting the ECF anatomy and confirming communication with the bowel. The aim of this paper is to increase radiologists' familiarity with ECF imaging, thus allowing an appropriate choice between medical, interventional, or surgical treatment, ultimately resulting in a higher likelihood of therapeutic success.

- **Teaching points**: Enterocutaneous fistulas may complicate abdominal surgery, Crohn's disease, and tumors; the high associated morbidity and mortality result from sepsis and malnutrition.

### Interventional radiologic management and treatment of enterocutaneous fistulae [^112KmHs2]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Enterocutaneous fistulae (ECFs) are abnormal sinus tract communications between the alimentary system and the skin surface that can cause significant management problems and costs to the healthcare system. Interventional radiology can play an important role in diagnosis and treatment when conventional measures fail, and additional surgery is difficult or poses a high risk. The management of patients with fistulae requires operator ingenuity and dedication, a multidisciplinary team approach, and an understanding of the pathophysiology. This article reviews the major issues in ECF management and the role of interventional radiology.

### Risk factors for obstetric fistula: A clinical review [^112cwcNM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urinary fistula:

- **Definition**: Urinary fistulas are abnormal connections between the urinary tract and another organ or body surface.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of urinary fistulas typically involves tissue damage and necrosis, subsequently leading to fistula formation. This damage can arise from a variety of causes, including trauma, surgery, or infection. Obstetric fistulas often occur due to prolonged obstructed labor, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis and the formation of a fistula between the urinary and genital tracts.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of bladder injury associated with gynecologic surgery is estimated at 3.2–4.8%. The prevalence of vesicovaginal fistula is estimated at 1 in 1,000 after hysterectomy and 1 in 1,000 deliveries.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for urinary fistulas include previous pelvic surgeries, radiation therapy, pelvic malignancies, and vaginal foreign bodies. For obstetric fistulas, risk factors include prolonged obstructed labor, teenage pregnancy, and home delivery without skilled birth attendants.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of urinary fistulas can vary widely depending on the location and size of the fistula. Common symptoms include urine leakage, urinary incontinence, recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), discomfort, and skin irritation or breakdown in the area where the urine is leaking. In vesicouterine fistulas, patients may present with hematuria, vaginal leakage of urine, and urethral passage of lochia.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^116LZdHT]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

One issue familiar to practitioners is the difficulty encountered when MRI is performed soon after therapeutic examination under anesthesia (EUA), when it can be problematic differentiating between treated and untreated disease. We were unable to identify any indexed research study that addressed this issue directly, so the recommendation that post-EUA MRI be delayed until at least four weeks was based on expert opinion alone.

The group was also able to reach consensus regarding a "minimum dataset" of information that should be contained within the imaging report. These recommendations were based exclusively on expert opinion, since we identified no research that investigated these items directly. However, a research article published by a group member subsequent to our literature search found that structured imaging reports for patients with fistula-in-ano missed fewer key features than narrative reports and had greater utility for the referring clinician. A further article from another group member advised a minimum dataset of items necessary for an informative report.

Accordingly, Table 2 describes those items that the present group considered comprise a minimum dataset for the reporting of MRI for fistula-in-ano. The aim is to present imaging information in a format useful to the referring clinician. For this reason, the group emphasized the importance of Parks' classification and clock-face nomenclature, since these are concepts instantly familiar to clinicians and radiologists working in this field. The group decided that the exact radial location of any fistula should be reported.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^111xDv8C]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Manifestations of vaginal fistulas (VF) are distressing regardless of type, including persistent vaginitis despite treatment, dyspareunia, and painful perineal dermatitis with excoriation. Entero-vaginal fistulas are identified by foul-smelling enteral or fecal discharge through the vagina, and fecal incontinence may develop secondary to associated loss of anal sphincter function.

The characteristic symptom of urinary VF is continual leakage of urine from the vagina and vulvar irritation. In recently operated patients, specific symptoms of VF are often masked by common post-operative problems such as abdominal and flank pain, hematuria, worsening renal function, fever, and paralytic ileus. Iatrogenic damage to the urinary tract is not unusual and is often indicated by the imaging detection of fluid collections representing urinoma. Biochemical assay of discharge fluid for creatinine levels and intravesical injection of methylene blue dye are helpful to confirm the presence of the VF.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^1166UYd9]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal fistulas (VF) represent abnormal communications between the vagina and either the distal portion of the digestive system or the lower urinary tract but lack an accepted classification and standardized terminology. Regardless of the underlying cause, these uncommon disorders result in profound physical, psychological, sexual, and social distress to the patients. Since the diagnosis of VF is challenging at gynecologic examination, ano-proctoscopy, and urethro-cystoscopy, imaging is crucial to confirm the fistula, visualize its site, course, and involved organ, and to characterize the underlying disease. The traditional conventional radiographic studies provided limited cross-sectional information and are nowadays largely replaced by CT and MRI studies.

Aiming to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with VF, this pictorial paper summarizes their clinical features, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approach, and presents the appropriate CT and MRI acquisition and interpretation techniques that vary according to the anatomic site and termination of the fistula. The role of state-of-the-art CT and MRI is presented with examples regarding both entero- (involving the colon, rectum, and anus) and urinary (connecting the bladder, distal ureter, or urethra) VF. The resulting combined anatomic and functional cross-sectional information is crucial to allow a correct therapeutic choice and surgical planning.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: A case report [^115k3819]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

A 16-year-old female patient presented to our center with a non-healing wound on her right inner thigh for a year and a half. She reported sustaining an injury to that area following a fall off a double-deck wooden bed at her boarding school, hitting the corner with minimal bleeding. Initially, the wound healed within a few days. She did not sustain any other injuries and continued attending school normally. Subsequently, she experienced intermittent pus discharge with occasional swelling on her right inner thigh. This was incised and drained on two occasions at a nearby health center, providing little relief and leading to recurrence.

During this period, she reported normal urinary habits, normal bowel habits, occasional low-grade fevers, a good appetite, and no history of body weight loss. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or malignancy.

Upon examination, she was fully conscious, afebrile, not pale, not jaundiced, not dehydrated, and nutritionally sound, with stable vital signs. A local examination revealed a right upper medial thigh sinus discharging pus: a 1х1 cm lesion with exophytic granulomatous margins surrounded by scar tissue. A chronic sinus was suspected. A pelvic X-ray was ordered, revealing normal osseous outlines. An MRI was requested, revealing a fistulous tract measuring about 10 cm in length, originating from the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder and passing through the pectineus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus.

### Current diagnosis and management of pelvic fistulae in women [^115ontRF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Pelvic fistulae are an abnormal communication among the genitourinary tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the vagina or perineum. Genital tract fistulae have been described in the medical literature for the past several thousand years. Advancements in both the diagnosis and treatment of vaginal fistulae have been obtained over the past century as surgical interventions have become safer and surgical techniques have improved.

The most common cause of fistulae worldwide is obstructed labor. In developed countries, fistulae most commonly occur after benign gynecologic surgery; however, obstructed labor, malignancy, radiation exposure, and inflammatory bowel disease can also be causative factors. Fistulae significantly affect quality of life. Diagnostic studies and radiologic imaging can aid in diagnosis, but a thorough physical examination is the most important component in the evaluation and diagnosis of a fistula.

Temporizing treatments are available to help ease patient suffering until surgical management can be performed. Surgical repairs can be executed using an abdominal, vaginal, or transanal approach. Although technically challenging, surgical repair is usually successful. However, closure of the fistula tract does not guarantee continence of urine or feces, as there is often underlying damage to the bowel and bladder.
