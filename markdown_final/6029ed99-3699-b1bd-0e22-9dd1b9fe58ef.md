## Question

Should we treat a 2yo with urinalysis showing 3+ leukocytes and > 182 wbcs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 2-year-old with urinalysis showing 3+ leukocyte esterase and more than 182 white blood cells per high-power field should be treated for a urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and whether guideline-based diagnostic criteria apply. Then, I should verify the significance of 3+ leukocyte esterase and a WBC count above 182 per high-power field. Next, I will check the specimen collection method and its implications for contamination and false positives. After that, I need to confirm whether both pyuria and bacteriuria are required for diagnosis and how to proceed with culture. Finally, I will consider empiric treatment, duration, and follow-up imaging, and I should double-check for any exceptions or caveats that might change management.

> Let me first confirm the age applicability. The AAP guideline targets febrile infants and young children 2 to 24 months, so a 2-year-old falls within the scope of these recommendations, which means the diagnostic framework requiring both abnormal urinalysis and positive culture applies here [^33d00944] [^48ec833e].

> Now, I need to interpret the urinalysis findings. 3+ leukocyte esterase is a strong marker of pyuria, and a WBC count greater than 182 per high-power field is far above the threshold of 5 WBCs/hpf used to define significant pyuria in children, indicating a very high likelihood of true inflammation in the urinary tract. Interval likelihood ratios show that 3+ leukocyte esterase and high WBC counts substantially increase the post-test probability of UTI in young children, which supports acting on these results while awaiting culture confirmation [^209ebfdf] [^6779c7f0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the specimen source because bagged or improperly collected samples carry a high false-positive rate. The AAP and ACEP policies emphasize that if antibiotics will be started, the diagnosis should be based on a specimen obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration, given the unacceptably high contamination and false-positive rates with bag specimens; if the current urinalysis was from a bag, I need to obtain a catheterized specimen for culture before treating, whereas if it was already catheterized, I can proceed with greater confidence in the urinalysis [^27a3e613] [^16a9593f] [^86fc09b2].

> I should confirm the diagnostic criteria. The AAP requires both evidence of pyuria and/or bacteriuria on urinalysis and at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen on culture from a properly collected specimen to establish UTI; pyuria alone is insufficient, and bacteriuria without pyuria suggests contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria, so I need a culture to confirm the diagnosis before labeling this as a UTI definitively [^48ec833e] [^9270b858] [^42244369].

> Given the marked pyuria, I will now examine the need for empiric therapy. In a 2-year-old with concerning urinalysis and no obvious alternative source of fever, it is reasonable to start empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results, because delays can increase the risk of progression and renal involvement; oral therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in stable children, and the agent should be chosen based on local resistance patterns, with typical options including amoxicillin-clavulanate, a cephalosporin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if local resistance is low and the child is not allergic [^996fc75a] [^4e6bb0e5] [^9b1ec760].

> Wait, let me verify the duration. The AAP recommends 7 to 14 days of therapy for febrile UTI, with most clinicians using 7 to 10 days for an initial episode in a child without complicating factors; shorter 1 to 3 day courses are inferior for febrile UTIs, so I should avoid them here [^aa79cd55] [^3389b020].

> Next, I should review follow-up and imaging. After a first febrile UTI in a child 2 to 24 months, renal and bladder ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for structural abnormalities, whereas routine VCUG is not indicated unless abnormalities are found on ultrasound or infections recur; I need to ensure timely follow-up to reassess symptoms and review culture results to narrow or stop antibiotics if the culture is negative or grows contaminants [^29fbf5df] [^e7f8234e].

> But wait, what if the child is completely well-appearing and the fever has resolved with antipyretics and there is a clear viral source? Could this still be asymptomatic bacteriuria with incidental pyuria? I should double-check for that possibility, because treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is not beneficial and may be harmful; if the clinical picture is equivocal and the child is well, it is reasonable to obtain a confirmatory catheterized specimen and observe closely without antibiotics if the child remains well and the pretest probability is low, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not fully exclude UTI and that my threshold to treat is lower with 3+ leukocyte esterase and very high WBCs [^392f28ba] [^f36c2ed5] [^6779c7f0].

> Putting this together, I should treat now if the child is febrile without a clear alternative source, using a catheterized specimen for culture if not already obtained, and start empiric oral antibiotics guided by local resistance patterns for 7 to 10 days, then tailor based on culture and sensitivities. If the urinalysis was from a bag, I should obtain a catheterized specimen before treating to avoid misdiagnosis from contamination, and if the child is well-appearing with a convincing viral diagnosis and low suspicion, observation with close follow-up and a confirmatory culture is reasonable but still carries some risk given the marked pyuria [^48ec833e] [^996fc75a] [^86fc09b2].

Treat a 2-year-old with **3+ leukocyte esterase and > 182 WBCs/hpf** as presumptive UTI if the child is febrile or symptomatic, and obtain a **catheterized urine culture** before starting antibiotics to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^27a3e613] [^16a9593f]. If the child is well-appearing and afebrile, consider observation with close follow-up, but **most experts would treat given the marked pyuria** [^6779c7f0]. Do not treat based on urinalysis alone if the child is asymptomatic and the specimen is contaminated; confirm with a properly collected specimen and culture [^48ec833e] [^f88e1090].

---

## Clinical significance of urinalysis findings

- **Leukocyte esterase**: A marker of pyuria, indicating an inflammatory response in the urinary tract. A 3+ result is strongly suggestive of significant inflammation and increases the likelihood of UTI [^6779c7f0].

- **White blood cells (WBCs)**: > 182 WBCs/hpf is markedly elevated and far exceeds the threshold for significant pyuria (≥ 5 WBCs/hpf), further supporting the diagnosis of UTI [^209ebfdf].

- **Bacteriuria**: Although not mentioned, the presence of bacteria on microscopy or a positive nitrite test would further increase the likelihood of UTI [^7f4330a2].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for pediatric UTI

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the diagnosis of UTI in children aged 2–24 months requires both:

- **Abnormal urinalysis**: Pyuria (≥ 5 WBCs/hpf or positive leukocyte esterase) and/or bacteriuria [^209ebfdf].

- **Positive urine culture**: ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen from a catheterized specimen [^9270b858].

Urinalysis alone is insufficient for a definitive diagnosis; **urine culture is required** to confirm UTI and identify the causative organism [^42244369].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Clinical features influence the likelihood of UTI. Febrile children aged 2–24 months without a clear source of infection have a **prevalence of UTI around 5–7%** [^33d00944]. Risk factors include female sex, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever duration > 24 hours, and higher fever (≥ 39°C) [^cf4ab823].

---

## Recommended management approach

### Confirmatory testing

Obtain a **catheterized urine specimen** for culture and sensitivity testing before initiating antibiotics, as this is the gold standard for diagnosis and guides appropriate therapy [^27a3e613] [^16a9593f]. If a catheterized specimen cannot be obtained immediately, a clean-catch specimen may be used for urinalysis, but a catheterized specimen should be obtained as soon as possible for culture [^f88e1090].

---

### Empiric antibiotic therapy

Initiate **empiric antibiotic therapy** if the child is febrile, symptomatic, or has a high likelihood of UTI based on clinical presentation and urinalysis findings. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in stable children [^996fc75a]. Common empiric choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if local resistance is low and the child is not allergic) [^4e6bb0e5].

---

### Duration of therapy

Treat for **7–14 days**, with 7–10 days being typical for uncomplicated cases [^aa79cd55] [^3389b020].

---

### Follow-up and imaging

Arrange follow-up to ensure clinical improvement and review culture results. Renal and bladder ultrasound (**RBUS**) is recommended after the first febrile UTI to evaluate for structural abnormalities, but routine voiding cystourethrography (**VCUG**) is not indicated unless abnormalities are found on ultrasound or infections recur [^29fbf5df] [^e7f8234e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: If the child is asymptomatic and the specimen is contaminated, treatment based on urinalysis alone is not recommended. Confirm with a properly collected specimen and culture before treating [^48ec833e] [^392f28ba].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Local resistance patterns should guide empiric antibiotic selection to ensure effective therapy [^996fc75a] [^9b1ec760].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the marked pyuria (3+ leukocyte esterase and > 182 WBCs/hpf), it is highly likely that this 2-year-old has a UTI. Obtain a **catheterized urine culture** before starting antibiotics, then initiate empiric therapy if the child is febrile or symptomatic. If the child is well-appearing and afebrile, consider observation with close follow-up, but most experts would treat given the significant pyuria.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

Urinalysis false negatives and organism patterns in febrile children — In a review of 749 children, 141 were excluded leaving 608 analyzed; thirty percent of children with a positive urine culture result had a negative urinalysis result (defined by negative leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite, and urine WBC count less than 5/ hpf), of the 183 negative urinalysis results, 59% were due to non–E coli organisms, and for predicting E coli versus non–E coli infections leukocyte esterase had LR = 2.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), nitrite LR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.5), and urine WBC count LR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.4).

Pyuria thresholds and assessment — The absence of pyuria in children with true UTIs is rare; common explanations for bacteriuria without pyuria include contaminated specimens, insensitive pyuria criteria, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^dd825a61]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Well-appearing 8- to 21-day-old febrile infants — urinalysis and culture (KAS 1): For febrile (temperature ≥ 38.0°C), well-appearing, term infants 8 to 21 days of age, clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or SPA of the bladder for urinalysis and, if urinalysis result is positive, for culture (Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation). A positive urinalysis result is defined as the presence of any leukocyte esterase (LE) on dipstick, > 5 WBCs per high-powered field (hpf) in centrifuged urine, or > 10 WBCs/ mm^3 in uncentrifuged urine on microscopic urinalysis using a hemocytometer. Of the estimated 10% of febrile infants with UTIs, 94% have urinalysis positive for leukocyte esterase (LE) (95% CI, 91%–97%).

Evidence base and diagnostic performance for urinalysis components: Searches included January 2003 through recent search dates of February 6, 2015 and March 13, 2015, identifying four hundred ninety-two articles; one hundred nine were selected for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question, consisting of 2 Class II and 8 Class III studies including infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years. In a subset of the Pediatric Research in Office Settings febrile infant study of 38,066 infants aged 0 to 3 months with a fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]), urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a single pathogen with ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for bag samples and ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL for catheterization samples; of the 1,482 infants who had urinalysis and urine cultures, 1,384 specimens were bag or catheterization, and for all specimens nitrites had better specificity (99% nitrites versus 91% leukocyte esterase).

### Predicting urinary tract infections with interval likelihood ratios [^6779c7f0]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protocols for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI) often use arbitrary cutoff values of urinalysis components to guide management. Interval likelihood ratios (ILRs) of urinalysis results may improve the test's precision in predicting UTIs. We calculated the ILR of urinalysis components to estimate the posttest probabilities of UTIs in young children.

Methods

Review of 2144 visits to the pediatric emergency department of an urban academic hospital from December 2011 to December 2019. Inclusion criteria were age < 2 years and having a urinalysis and urine culture sent. ILR boundaries for hemoglobin, protein, and leukocyte esterase were "negative", "trace", "1+", "2+" and "3+". Nitrite was positive or negative. Red blood cells and white blood cells (WBCs) were 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 50, 50 to 100, and 100 to 250. Bacteria counts ranged from negative to "loaded". ILRs for each component were calculated and posttest probabilities for UTI were estimated.

Results

The UTI prevalence was 9.2%, with the most common pathogen being Escherichia coli (75.2%). The ILR for leukocyte esterase ranged from 0.20 (negative) to 37.68 (3+) and WBCs ranged from 0.24 (0–5 WBCs) to 47.50 (100–250 WBCs). The ILRs for nitrites were 0.76 (negative) and 25.35 (positive). The ILR for negative bacteria on urinalysis was 0.26 and 14.04 for many bacteria.

Conclusions

The probability of UTI in young children significantly increases with 3+ leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite results, 20 to 50 or higher WBCs, and/or many or greater bacteria on urinalysis. The probability of UTI only marginally increases with trace or 1+ leukocyte esterase or 5 to 20 WBCs. Our findings can be used to more accurately predict the probability of true UTI in children.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^729ded64]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Screening urinalysis is only moderately sensitive and has been reported to miss approximately 20% of urinary tract infections in febrile young infants. The worry, when this occurs, is that infants with missed urinary tract infections on account of normal screening urinalysis results will progress to septicemia or bacterial meningitis from concomitant bacteremia unrecognized at the initial visit. We show in this study that this concern is unwarranted for the most part because urine leukocytes are an adequate screen for bacteriuric sepsis. Specifically, we find that few leukocytes in urine and a negative urine dipstick result at the initial visit reflect a low risk of concomitant sepsis in young infants when a urinary pathogen is unexpectedly isolated from culture.

Other plausible markers of bona fide urinary tract infections such as the concentration of bacteria in urine also differ significantly between bacteriuric infants with low and high leukocytes in urine, supporting categorization to separate clinical groups. Based on these differences and the relatively low risk of concomitant sepsis observed in the present study, it appears safe to manage, on an outpatient basis, febrile young infants who are well-appearing and have few leukocytes in urine, as recommended in clinical practice guidelines for fever. The risk of adverse outcome when depending on this strategy is likely to be low provided infants are carefully selected for outpatient management, the interval to urine culture result is short, follow-up is assured, and other tests, when deemed necessary, are available for the complementary but separate task of identifying infants with serious bacterial infections not associated with bacteriuria.

Fever in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years — urinary tract infection risk predictors and testing (Level C): Infants and children at increased risk for urinary tract infection include females younger than 12 months, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever duration greater than 24 hours, higher fever (≥ 39°C), negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection. Although the presence of a viral infection decreases the risk, no clinical feature has been shown to effectively exclude urinary tract infection. Physicians should consider urinalysis and urine culture testing to identify urinary tract infection in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F), especially among those at higher risk for urinary tract infection. Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^80ac2714]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

KAS 1 Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA — clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for urinalysis and, if the urinalysis result is positive, for culture; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Quality A. For 1000 infants, approximately 94 to 98 infants with urinary tract infections will be detected by a positive urinalysis result, and 2 to 6 may be missed; if the urinalysis result is negative, an estimated 200 to 500 catheterizations or SPAs followed by cultures would be required to detect 1 additional infant with bacteriuria. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline basis used pyuria and at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per mL in appropriately collected urine, whereas 10 000 colony-forming units/mL is now an acceptable threshold for diagnosing urinary tract infection from catheterized urine specimens when pyuria and fever are also present, and this addresses laboratories not reporting graduations from 10 000 to 100 000. Culture of urine specimens not collected by catheterization or SPA is not recommended because of an unacceptable rate of false-positive results attributable to contamination, and positive urine culture results without an abnormal urinalysis indicating inflammation are likely to represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination; SPA is effective and complications are rare.

Microscopic analysis for bacteriuria — Bacteria seen on Gram-stained, uncentrifuged urine correlate with 105 CFUs per mL in culture. An enhanced urinalysis that combines counting chamber pyuria assessment with Gram staining of uncentrifuged urine, using a threshold of at least 1 Gram-negative rod in 10 oil immersion fields, has greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value than standard urinalysis and is the preferred method of urinalysis when appropriate equipment and personnel are available.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^24ee0e3f]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection is by far the most common serious bacterial infection in febrile young infants. The diagnosis is suspected when screening urinalysis reveals pyuria and confirmed when a uropathogen is isolated from urine culture. When, however, this infection is missed on account of few leukocytes in urine (a recognized limitation), there is the concern – empirically unsubstantiated at present – that affected infants left untreated at the initial clinical encounter will return with invasive sepsis.

For this reason, the challenge to clinicians when utilizing screening urinalysis – heightened when relying on this test alone for decision-making (an option endorsed by clinical practice guidelines for the management of fever in young well-appearing infants) – is to determine not only that the test is able to identify urinary tract infections, but also that it independently reflects the risk, at the initial visit, of invasive bacterial infections due to the urinary tract pathogen if present. To date, few data have been published regarding the utility of the screening urinalysis in this role. In this study, we tackle this question, hypothesizing an association in febrile young infants between the concentration of leukocytes in urine and the risk of bacteriuric sepsis.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^838750ab]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we show that urine leukocytes reflect well the risk of concomitant sepsis in febrile young (0–89 day old) infants with bacteriuria. Reassuringly, we find low odds of invasive sepsis by uropathogens even when urinary tract infections – the most common serious bacterial infections at this age – are missed at the initial visit on account of few leukocytes in urine. The low risk of invasive sepsis in bacteriuric infants with 'normal' screening urinalysis mitigates a major limitation of this test – a modest tendency to miss urinary tract infections – and indicates that fever management strategies reported in the literature that rely on urinalysis for screening are likely to be safe in selected febrile well-appearing young infants managed on an outpatient basis and assured of close follow-up.

The comment emphasizes that the diagnosis of UTI in febrile infants is signaled by the presence of both bacteriuria and pyuria, that pyuria without bacteriuria is insufficient to make a diagnosis of UTI, and that bacteriuria without pyuria is attributable to contamination, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or very early infection; non-Escherichia coli isolates are less frequently associated with pyuria than E coli and non-E coli uropathogens are of concern because they are more likely to result in scarring than E coli, although animal studies indicate host inflammatory response drives scarring and the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria can account for the lack of association with pyuria.

Febrile infants and young children in emergency departments — dipstick and urinalysis accuracy are reported from multiple Class III studies. In a retrospective review of 375 pediatric ED patients aged 0 to 10 years, urinary tract infection prevalence was 10.7%, urine dipstick sensitivity 92.5% (95% CI 84.3% to 100%) and specificity 39.4% (95% CI 34.2% to 44.6%). In the 0- to 2-year group (160 patients), prevalence was 15%, sensitivity 87.5% (95% CI 74.3% to 100%), and specificity 39.7% (95% CI 31.5% to 47.9%); in the 2- to 10-year group, prevalence was 7.0%, sensitivity 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), and specificity 39.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 46%). In another study of febrile patients younger than 2 years (mean age 9.3 months) at a United Kingdom pediatric ED, a test positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood was 97.12% specific (95% CI 94.17% to 98.96%) with a positive LR of 15.13 (95% CI 6.99 to 32.76), and a test negative for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, blood, and protein had a sensitivity of 97.44% (95% CI 91.12% to 99.29%) with a negative LR of 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). A multicenter febrile infant study from Spain (N = 649; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL sterile collection; < 90 days; ≥ 38°C) reported leukocyte esterase mean sensitivity 82.1%, mean specificity 92.4%, mean negative predictive value 97.8% for female patients (N = 176) and 94.1% for male patients (N = 473), and mean positive predictive value 58% for female patients and 79.4% for male patients. Another pediatric ED Class III study of febrile patients younger than 5 years (half the patients were ≤ 12 months) with a urinary tract infection prevalence of 17.6% found, for all patients, sensitivities and negative predictive values respectively: nitrite 20% and 85%, hemoglobin 44% and 88%, leukocyte esterase 48% and 90%, 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 48% and 90%, centrifuge Gram's stain 60% and 92%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%; for infants aged 12 months or younger versus older than 12 months, respective sensitivities were nitrite 7% and 23%, hemoglobin 33% and 53%, leukocyte esterase 42% and 53%; 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 42% and 53%, centrifuge Gram's stain 42% and 76%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm 3 on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

Urinalysis general considerations — Urinalysis cannot substitute for urine culture to document the presence of UTI but needs to be used in conjunction with culture; because urine culture results are not available for at least 24 hours, there is considerable interest in tests that may predict the culture result and enable presumptive therapy, and urinalysis can be performed on any specimen, including one collected from a bag applied to the perineum, but the specimen must be fresh (< 1 hour after voiding with maintenance at room temperature or < 4 hours after voiding with refrigeration) to ensure sensitivity and specificity.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^63e4f694]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, being retrospective, it shares the limitations of this study design. Primarily, we cannot prove a pathophysiological link between the urine leukocyte count and the likelihood of invasive bacterial infections. It is also not possible to determine, retrospectively, whether antibiotics were administered prior to urine collection in some infants. Fortunately, at our site, antibiotic pretreatment in this age-group is highly unlikely and so would not alter our conclusions. The enhanced urinalysis technique (compared to standard urinalysis), because of better test performance characteristics, may support more accurate diagnosis but was not evaluated by us because it is not utilized at our institution. Irrespective of the specific technique utilized, however, it is reasonable to expect an even lower urine leukocyte count to translate to still lower odds of concomitant bacteriuric sepsis in infants with initially missed urinary tract infections. With respect to standard urinalysis, some clinicians may find it useful to lower the threshold for urine leukocytes to 5 cells/hpf – as proposed in a recent study – to further reduce the risk of bacteriuric sepsis associated with expectant management. As mentioned earlier, test selection bias was unlikely to affect our results appreciably during the years of study, an interval during which compliance with full sepsis protocols was likely to be highest.

Finally, although not specifically evaluated in this study, we expect the short delay reported in a recent study from the first visit to a report of positive urine culture – about 16 hours – to further lower the risk of invasive sepsis and to permit the safe application of expectant strategies in febrile young infants. Rapid turn-around of the urine culture report should shorten the exposure of infants to unduly long periods of unrecognized urinary tract infection, concomitant sepsis, or needless antibiotic treatment. In cases among whom fever is merely the first sign of an incipient but easily recognized viral infection, expectant management may also permit a firmer diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria to be made. Prospective studies are needed to formally investigate these possibilities and to solidify our results. We do not address the related issue of the impact of urinary leukocytes on the risk of renal scarring among young infants with positive urine culture. Other investigators address this outcome more fully, reporting a low risk in infants and young children with low leukocytes in urine.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^69c1d885]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Our findings corroborate those by other investigators who have also reported differences in clinical outcomes between infants and children with urinary tract infections after stratification by the leukocyte count in urine. Of particular interest, are studies that report lower levels of acute phase reactants in blood, fewer structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and a lower incidence of renal scarring, suggesting milder disease in children less than 24 months of age with few leukocytes in urine. The specific reasons are unclear for the outcomes noted in these studies and ours between young infants with low and high urine leukocyte counts. It is conceivable, however, that few urine leukocytes in infants diagnosed with urinary tract infections reflect low virulence of pathogens, indicate mere colonization or contamination of urine, suggest infection confined to the lower urinary tract, or point to urine infections of insufficient duration or severity to induce an inflammatory response. The lower concentration, observed in our study, of bacteria isolated from urine of infants with normal urinalysis supports a number of these hypotheses. Unfortunately, there is currently no timely way to differentiate between these possibilities in a way that is accurate enough to have clinical utility at the initial visit.

To inform initial management decisions, therefore, it seems to us more pragmatic to identify in operational terms, as done in this study, febrile well-appearing infants at risk of bacteriuric sepsis. Risk-stratification for sepsis that is based on the urine leukocyte count undergirds expectant fever management strategies and is supported by studies that indicate not only a low risk to withholding empiric antibiotic treatment, but also the non-trivial prospect of developing acute pyelonephritis within months of antibiotic treatment in young children with few leukocytes in urine ultimately diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria. The low odds, observed in this study, of invasive sepsis complicating unrecognized bacteriuria in febrile infants with few leukocytes in urine, complements in the acute setting observations previously noted at longer time intervals. Together, these data reinforce fever management strategies that rely on screening tests like urinalysis for decision-making vis-à-vis supporting more judicious antibiotic treatment in febrile well-appearing young infants (specifically, those beyond the neonatal period) who satisfy low-risk criteria for sepsis.

### Can a simple urinalysis predict the causative agent and the antibiotic sensitivities? [^186e44b3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was (1) to determine the reliability of urinalysis (UA) for predicting urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile children, (2) to determine whether UA findings can predict Escherichia coli versus non-E. coli urinary tract infection, and (3) to determine if empiric antibiotics should be selected based on E. coli versus non-E. coli infection predictions.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of children from 2 months to 2 years of age who presented to the emergency department with fever (rectal temperature > 100.4°F) and had a positive urine culture. This study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2007. Negative UA was defined as urine white blood cell count less than 5 per high-power field, negative leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites. Urine cultures were classified into E. coli and non-E. coli groups. These groups were compared for sex, race, and UA findings. Multivariate forward logistic regression, using the Wald test, was performed to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of each variable (eg, sex, race, UA parameters) in predicting UTI. In addition, antibiotic sensitivities between both groups were compared.

Results

Of 749 medical records reviewed, 608 were included; negative UA(-) was present in 183 cases, and positive UA(+) was observed in 425 cases. Furthermore, 424 cases were caused by E. coli, and 184 were due to non-E. coli organisms. Among 425 UA(+) cases, E. coli was identified in 349 (82.1%), whereas non-E. coli organisms were present in 76 (17.9%); in contrast, in 183 UA(-) cases, 108 (59%) were due to non-E. coli organisms versus 75 (41%), which were caused by E. coli. Urinalysis results were shown to be associated with organism group (P < 0.001). Positive leukocytes esterase had an LR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.2), positive nitrites had an LR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4–5.5), and urine white blood cell count had an LR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.4) in predicting E. coli versus non-E. coli infections. Antibiotic sensitivity compared between UA groups demonstrated equivalent superiority of cefazolin (94.7% sensitive in UA(+) vs 84.0% in UA(-) group; P < 0.0001), cefuroxime (98.2% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and nitrofurantoin (96.1% vs 82.2%; P < 0.0001) in the UA(+) group. In contrast, the UA(-) group showed significant sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (82.2% vs 71.3% in UA(+); P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Urinalysis is not an accurate predictor of UTI. A positive urine culture in the presence of negative UA most likely grew non-E. coli organisms, whereas most UA(+) results were associated with E. coli. This study also highlighted local patterns of antibiotic resistance between E. coli and non-E. coli groups. Negative UA results in the presence of strong suspicion of a UTI suggest a non-E. coli organism, which may be best treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conversely, UA(+) results suggest E. coli, which calls for treatment with cefazolin or cefuroxime.

Benefits include identification of UTIs, and risks include falsely positive culture results or misdiagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria leading to unnecessary or harmful treatment, plus discomfort from catheterization or SPA; the benefit–harm assessment is "Preponderance of benefit". Parents opposed to catheterization should be offered SPA and informed about higher rates of ambiguous or false-positive culture results from bagged or voided specimens, and that a false-positive urine culture can prolong antimicrobial administration and hospitalization.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^b04c4cae]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

### Can diagnostic and imaging recommendations from the 2011 AAP UTI guidelines be applied to infants [^5534d886]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of children 2-to-24-months-old with initial febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI). Available data were insufficient to determine whether evidence from studies of 2-to-24-month-olds applies to those < 2-months-old, so they were excluded.

Objective

This study aimed to 1) compare demographic, clinical, imaging and outcomes between patients < 2-months-old and those 2-to-24-months-old hospitalized with fUTI, and 2) assess whether diagnostic and imaging recommendations of the AAP 2011 guidelines apply to those < 2-months-old.

Study Design

A cohort study of patients ≤ 24-months-old hospitalized at a children's hospital with fUTI from 2016 to 2018 was conducted. Data were collected via a prospectively generated electronic medical record note template, supplemented with retrospective chart review. Primary outcomes included differences in demographics, clinical presentation, urine culture results, and imaging utilization/results by age group. Secondary outcomes included surgical procedures, UTI recurrence, and 90-day all-cause readmissions and emergency department (ED) revisits. Univariate and bivariate statistics were utilized to compare age groups.

Results

Overall, 137 patients were included (median age 70 days, 55.5% male [92.1% uncircumcised], 53.3% Hispanic/Latino, 89.8% 1st fUTI). There were no demographic differences between groups, except children < 2-months-old were more frequently male (71.2 vs 43.6%, p = 0.002). The Summary Table compares clinical factors and imaging utilization by age. There were no differences in urinalysis or urine culture results between groups. Patients < 2-months-old had shorter fever duration, lower maximum temperature, and lower white blood cell counts. Voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs) were recommended and obtained more frequently in patients < 2-months-old, but there were no differences in renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) or VCUG results between age groups. There were no differences in UTI recurrence (13.6% of < 2-months-old vs 14.1% of 2-to-24-months-old, p = 1.00) or fUTI recurrence (13.6 vs 7.7%, p = 0.40) within 1 year, 90-day readmission (6.8 vs 6.4%, p = 1.00), or 90-day ED revisit (22.0 vs 20.5%, p = 1.00).

Discussion

There were minimal differences between the < 2-months-old and 2-to-24-months-old age groups in demographics, laboratory (including microbial) or imaging results, or clinical outcomes. Patients < 2-months-old were more frequently male and less ill. These data support applying urinalysis and urine culture diagnostic criteria, and universal RBUS, from the AAP guidelines to patients < 2-months-old. Given utilization differences, applicability of VCUG guideline recommendations requires further clarification for patients < 2-months-old.

Conclusion

Laboratory testing and RBUS recommendations from the AAP guidelines may be safely applied to infants < 2-months-old. Further studies are needed to clarify optimal VCUG recommendations.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^0d38d0ad]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive febrile (temperature in triage ≥ 38°C) infants aged 0 days to 89 days seen in the emergency department at Children's Hospital Boston from January 1993 to June 1999. This 6-year period immediately followed, (1) the publication in 1993 of practice guidelines for fever in young children and infants and (2) the formal adoption, specifically at our institution, of a novel strategy for routine and comprehensive management of febrile young infants on an outpatient basis. It reflects, therefore, an interval during which compliance with full laboratory testing to detect bacterial sepsis – an integral part of this strategy – was likely to be highest (unlikely to have become degraded by the passage of time), mitigating the potential for test selection bias. Ethical approval to conduct the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital and consent by patients was not required.

The emergency department is located within an academic children's hospital in an urban setting. Families are either self-referred (elect to come to the emergency department) or are referred by their primary care physicians. Annually, there are 50,000 visits to the department. Thirty-five percent of patients visiting the department are Caucasian, 25% are African American, 20% are Hispanic, and 20% constitute other races or else did not state their racial origin. Patients included in the study were young infants presenting to our emergency department with fever who underwent a full sepsis workup. This sepsis strategy comprises collection of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid for screening and culture. Screening test results of urine (dipstick/urinalysis), blood (white blood cell count), and spinal fluid (white blood cell count) are promptly reported to the treating physician on the day of encounter and used to inform decisions as to whether to admit or discharge, as well as whether to administer or withhold antibiotic treatment.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|
|Non-low risk, first option|- Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis|
|Non-low risk, second option|- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis < br > - Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture if urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria) < br > - Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.|

### Diagnosis and management of UTI in febrile infants age 0–2 months: applicability of the AAP guideline [^3c420afb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in young infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guideline for UTIs focuses on febrile children age 2–24 months, with no guideline for infants < 2 months of age, an age group commonly encountered by pediatric hospitalists. In this review, we assess the applicability of the AAP UTI Guideline's action statements for previously healthy, febrile infants < 2 months of age. We also discuss additional considerations in this age group, including concurrent bacteremia and routine testing for meningitis.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^27a3e613]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%", and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used". For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%", a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time", and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%"; for circumcised boys at "0.2%", it "is 99%". Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI". Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)", "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive", "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially".

Well-appearing febrile infants — clinical prediction models and age-based management are summarized as follows: Prediction models used arbitrary laboratory thresholds, for example defining an abnormal white blood cell (WBC) count as ≤ 5000 per mm3 or > 15 000 per mm3, and recommendations generally relied on clinical appearance, age, urinalysis, WBC (and/or absolute neutrophil count [ANC], band count, and/or immature to total neutrophil ratio), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, except that the Rochester criteria did not require CSF. These models had moderately high sensitivities (90% to 95%) and high negative predictive values (97%–99%), alongside relatively low positive predictive values (20% to 40%). In age-based care patterns, "it was recommended that all infants in the youngest group (< 29 days of age) should receive extensive evaluations, hospitalization, and empirical antimicrobial treatment", whereas "infants 29 to 90 days of age could be managed with presumptive intramuscular ceftriaxone as outpatients with pending blood, urine, and CSF culture results".

### Negative urinalyses in febrile infants age 7 to 60 days treated for urinary tract infection [^5e2957c8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of the urinalysis (UA) in the management of young, febrile infants is controversial. To assess how frequently infants are treated for urinary tract infection (UTI) despite having normal UA values and to compare the characteristics of infants treated for UTI who have positive versus negative UAs, we reviewed 20,570 wellappearing febrile infants 7–60 days of age evaluated at 124 hospitals in the United States who were included in a national quality improvement project. Of 19,922 infants without bacteremia and meningitis, 2,407 (12.1%) were treated for UTI, of whom 2,298 (95.5%) had an initial UA performed. UAs were negative in 337/2,298 (14.7%) treated subjects. The proportion of infants treated for UTI with negative UAs ranged from 0%-35% across hospitals. UA-negative subjects were more likely to have respiratory symptoms and less likely to have abnormal inflammatory markers than UA+ subjects, indicating that they are mounting less of an inflammatory response to their underlying illness and/or might have contaminated specimens or asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^4e6bb0e5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### White blood cell count can aid judicious antibiotic prescribing in acute upper respiratory infections in children [^c7191941]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Fifty percent or more of children with upper respiratory infections (URIs) and nonspecific febrile illnesses (e.g., children febrile, anorexic, decreased activity, irritable) receive unnecessary antibiotics from community-based physicians. This study was undertaken to show that white blood cell (WBC) count testing can aid physicians in avoiding antibiotic prescribing when managing children with URIs, and nonspecific febrile illnesses. A prospective, 3-year study was conducted in a community-based pediatric practice. A weekly convenience sample (Tuesdays) of acute URI and febrile patients ages 3 months to 21 years was studied. Data collected on enrollment included: age, gender, duration of illness, recent/current antibiotic use, temperature, symptoms, signs, laboratory testing (WBC count, cultures), diagnosis and treatment. Similar data on any illness visits in the previous 2 weeks and the subsequent 2 weeks after enrollment were collected. Viral culture specimens were obtained on a subset. The use of the WBC count was assessed, including obviating antibiotic prescription, frequency of related follow-up visits, and the occurrence of subsequent bacterial infections. Of 1,956 patients with respiratory or febrile illness enrolled, 1,219 (62%) had a diagnosis established by history and examination (e.g., acute otitis media) and 737 (38%) did not. Of the 737 patients without an established diagnosis, 386 (52%) did not receive an antibiotic because they did not appear particularly ill, their temperature was less than 101 degrees F, and parents were not demanding antibiotics, leaving 351 (48%) patients who appeared ill, had a temperature greater than 101 degrees F, and parents were demanding an antibiotic or physicians were inclined to give an antibiotic. A WBC count was performed on these 351 children; 337 children (96%) had a WBC count less than 15,000/mm3, and 14 (4%) had a WBC 15,000/mm3 or greater. An antibiotic was prescribed for 13 of the 14 children with a WBC count greater than 15,000/mms. With this approach, return office visits in the following 2 weeks were infrequent (13% of 737 patients), and no child had significant bacterial illness that was missed.

### Urine dipstick for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 Months [^b047fba6]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Urine dipsticks can be performed at the point of care, whereas urinalysis requires laboratory analysis. We compared the accuracy of urine dipstick with urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study of previously healthy infants aged 2 to 6 months who presented to one of 5 emergency departments with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 °C and had a catheterized urine culture obtained. We defined a UTI with a urine culture growing greater than or equal to 50000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of a single bacterial uropathogen. Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to select the optimal urine white blood cell (WBC) cut point, we compared positive urine dipstick (≥ 1+ leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite) to dichotomized urine WBC count for the diagnosis of UTI.

Results

Of 9387 febrile infants who had a urine culture performed, 1044 (11%) had a UTI. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen identified (923; 88.4%). The optimal urine WBC cut point was greater than or equal to 7 cells per high-power field (HPF). When compared with urine WBC count of greater than or equal to 7 cells per HPF, urine dipstick had a higher sensitivity (831/921 [90.2%] dipstick vs 738/880 [83.9%] urine WBC; difference 6.4%, 95% CI 3.8%-8.9%) and specificity (6352/6862 [92.6%] dipstick vs 3679/4231 [87.0%] urine WBC; difference 5.6%, 95% CI 4.7%-6.6%).

Conclusion

Urine dipstick is an accurate diagnostic test for UTI in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months. Laboratory urinalysis may not be required to guide initial treatment decisions.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^33d00944]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children — scope and key definitions: This guideline focuses on the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children (2–24 months of age) who have no obvious neurologic or anatomic abnormalities known to be associated with recurrent UTI or renal damage, and uses the phrase "febrile infants" to indicate febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age. In studies underlying these limits, the prevalence of UTI is high (~5%) in this age group and fever was defined as temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥ 100.4°F), which is the definition adopted here. Neonates and infants less than 2 months of age are excluded, and data are insufficient to determine whether evidence from infants 2 to 24 months applies to children more than 24 months of age.

### Improving management: novel guidelines for diagnosing urinary tract infection in infants [^cf4f998f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the pediatric field remains a topic of debate. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) introduced new guidelines for the diagnosis of UTI in patients 2–24 months old. However, concerns were raised regarding these guidelines.

Methods

This is a retrospective data extraction study that included patients 0–6 months of age who were examined in the pediatric emergency department between 2016 and 2021 and had a urine culture. For each patient, we recorded the diagnosis documented in the medical records, the diagnosis based on the AAP and Israeli guidelines, and the diagnosis according to our 2 proposed protocols. We then compared the percentage of UTI diagnoses according to each diagnostic guideline.

Results

A total of 1432 patients under the age of 6 months underwent urine culture testing during the study period. A total of 83 (5.81%) of these patients were diagnosed with UTI according to the AAP guidelines, 184 of the patients (12.8%) were diagnosed with UTI according to the Israeli guidelines, 102 (7.1%) and 109 (7.6%) of the patients were diagnosed with UTI according to our first and second proposed guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

We propose a new diagnostic method (guidelines II) that is suitable for patients older than 2 months, with obligatory criteria of abnormal urine test and a lower threshold for the colony count required for diagnosis compared to the AAP guidelines. Further research is required to examine the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed guidelines, so it may replace the current diverse guidelines.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Evaluation and management of infants and young children with fever [^422117b6]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

A practice guideline for the management of febrile infants and children younger than three years of age sparked controversy when it was published in 1993. Surveys indicate that many office-based physicians do not agree with recommendations for venipuncture and bladder catheterization in nontoxic febrile children, and that many employ watchful waiting rather than empiric antibiotic therapy. Surveys of parents note a preference for less testing and treatment. More aggressive management may be appropriate in febrile infants younger than three months old; however, criteria have been proposed to identify infants older than one month who are at low risk for serious bacterial infection. Because of widespread vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae infection, Streptococcus pneumoniae has become the cause of most cases of bacteremia. The risk of serious bacterial infection is greater in younger children and in those with higher temperatures and white blood cell counts. Controversy persists regarding the age, temperature and white blood cell count values that serve as indications for further evaluation or empiric antibiotic therapy.

It then asks "Second or higher proven UTI or VCUG indicated by RBUS?" and, if yes, directs to "Obtain VCUG to evaluate for grade IV–V VUR"; imaging results guide "Urologic management as indicated by imaging", and families are advised: "Instruct family to seek medical care for future fevers to ensure timely treatment of UTI".

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Further research is needed to establish clear criteria for urine testing in febrile patients. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Effective management of UTI hinges on appropriate diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship, aiming to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for ASB. Symptom-based testing is key to ensure appropriate urine culture testing and proper diagnosis of UTI. 52, 53 A 2017 systematic review54 showed 45% of included patients experienced inappropriate initiation of antimicrobial treatment for ASB; various interventions, such as education on diagnostic protocols, provided a significant absolute risk reduction of 33%. Avoiding overtesting and resulting overtreatment of ASB is essential to preserving antimicrobial effectiveness. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs.

Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates. Due to low resistance rates and clinical effectiveness, ceftriaxone is the recommended empirical choice for patients who require intravenous therapy, barring any risk factors for multidrug resistance. 79, 80 In general, agents with antipseudomonal activity should only be used in patients with risk factors for nosocomial pathogens. However, it may be reasonable to use carbapenem therapy empirically in hemodynamically unstable patients for whom there is a specific concern regarding extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria. Overall, selection should be guided by local susceptibilities and patient-specific risk factors.

Empirical treatment decisions can be made based on review of the individual patient's urinary tract anatomy or dysfunction, allergies medication list for interactions, microbiological and prior treatment history, the type of UTI, and the clinical severity of presentation. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation. Multiple RCTs comprised patients with gram negative bacteremia from predominantly urinary sources demonstrate noninferiority of 7 days compared with 14 total days of treatment for a variety of patient-oriented outcomes, such as clinical cure, clinical failure, relapse, and all-cause mortality. 145–148 Thus, we can provide a clear recommendation for 7 days of treatment for gram negative bacteremia from a urinary source when source control has been addressed. Whether shorter duration.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the urinalysis for urinary tract infection in infants [^62f8320a]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline suggests incorporation of a positive urinalysis (UA) into the definition of UTI. However, concerns linger over UA sensitivity in young infants. Infants with the same pathogenic organism in the blood and urine (bacteremic UTI) have true infections and represent a desirable population for examination of UA sensitivity.

Methods

We collected UA results on a cross-sectional sample of 276 infants < 3 months of age with bacteremic UTI from 11 hospital systems. Sensitivity was calculated on infants who had at least a partial UA performed and had ≥ 50000 colony-forming units per milliliter from the urine culture. Specificity was determined by using a random sample of infants from the central study site with negative urine cultures.

Results

The final sample included 245 infants with bacteremic UTI and 115 infants with negative urine cultures. The sensitivity of leukocyte esterase was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.5%-99.2%) and of pyuria (> 3 white blood cells/high-power field) was 96% (95% CI 92.5%-98.1%). Only 1 infant with bacteremic UTI (Group B Streptococcus) and a complete UA had an entirely negative UA. In infants with negative urine cultures, leukocyte esterase specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 87.9–97.5) and of pyuria was 91.3% (84.6%-95.6%).

Conclusions

In young infants with bacteremic UTI, UA sensitivity is higher than previous reports in infants with UTI in general. This finding can be explained by spectrum bias or by inclusion of faulty gold standards (contaminants or asymptomatic bacteriuria) in previous studies.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^4e5da54f]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Urinalysis and urinary tract infection (UTI) as meningitis risk among infants 7 to 30 days: Data for 22- to 28-day-old infants are limited, but in the Reducing Variability in the Infant Sepsis Evaluation study of 1281 infants with positive urinalysis results who had an LP performed, 0.8% were treated for bacterial meningitis, similar to 1.0% of the 4644 infants with negative urinalysis results; none of the 98 infants with positive urinalysis results who did not have an LP ultimately had meningitis detected. In an outpatient study of 100 infants with UTI < 30 days of age, researchers found no cases of meningitis; however, in both studies, the lower limits of the confidence intervals indicate up to 4% could be missed.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^38c35ea6]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Risk tolerance in febrile infant evaluation — quantitative examples illustrate trade-offs: Based on cited prevalences, a urinary tract infection (UTI) risk of 10% translates to performing 10 urinalyses to detect one UTI (number needed to test = 10). Clinical scenarios include bacteremia likelihood 1:100 (number needed to treat = 100) and bacterial meningitis risk 1:1000 (number needed to test = 1000), raising questions such as whether 100 antibiotic doses to treat a single bacteremia case or performing lumbar punctures (LPs) to obtain 1000 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples is tolerable. Risk appraisal also varies between clinicians and families; for example, a clinician may estimate meningitis risk at 1% and indicate an LP, whereas a parent may require a higher threshold.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^392f28ba]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in children — evidence and research needs: In girls with ASB, symptomatic reinfections after therapy occurred in 7 of 46 (15%), all with new E. coli strains isolated, whereas bacteriuria persisted in all girls treated with erythromycin and none developed symptomatic infection following antimicrobial therapy. Screening modeling projected substantial test burden and cost: screening of 100 000 hypothetical preschool children using standard culture techniques would result in nearly 20 000 false-positive tests and 143 false negatives, with total costs estimated at nearly $2 million dollars in 1992. The rationale states there is moderate-quality evidence that there is no benefit and high-quality evidence of harm; ASB is uncommon in infants and boys and occurs in about 1%–3% of healthy girls; there is no evidence of a higher risk for subsequent renal scarring or renal insufficiency; and there is no evidence that treatment prevents symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, renal scarring, or renal insufficiency. It also notes studies addressing ASB in children were performed > 40 years ago without indications that incidence or outcomes would differ today, and identifies research needs: future studies of antimicrobial therapy should include renal scarring as a primary outcome, and studies enrolling children with neuromuscular disorders and immunocompromised states should be a priority.

### Urine specific gravity and the accuracy of urinalysis [^dec5a699]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent study in young infants found that different cutoffs maximized the accuracy of the urine white blood cell count in dilute versus concentrated urine samples. We aimed to confirm this finding and to determine its impact on clinical care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of data gathered on consecutive children < 24 months of age with visits to the emergency department during a 5-year period. We evaluated the accuracy of screening tests for urinary tract infection (UTI) in dilute and concentrated urine samples. We also calculated the number of children who would have been treated differently in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 children presenting with fever had urine specific gravity (SG) been taken into consideration.

Results

We included 10078 children. The ability to rule in UTI (as measured by the positive likelihood ratio [LR]) was similar in dilute and concentrated urine for the leukocyte esterase test (11.76 vs 10.71, respectively). The positive LR for urine white blood cell count per high-powered field was higher in dilute urine (9.83 vs 6.12). In contrast, the positive LR for the nitrite test was lower in dilute urine (20.54 vs 47.44). Despite these differences, we found little change in the number of children treated with antibiotics in predictive models that took urine SG into consideration.

Conclusions

Although we found that urine SG influences the accuracy of some components of the urinalysis, its inclusion in the decision-making process had negligible effect on the clinical care of children with UTI.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9b5ee3f3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Is a lumbar puncture necessary when evaluating febrile infants (30 to 90 days of age) with an abnormal urinalysis? [^e25e2fd1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines for the management of febrile infants aged 30 to 90 days presenting to the emergency department (ED) suggest that a lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed routinely if a positive urinalysis is found during initial investigations. The aim of our study was to assess the necessity of routine LPs in infants aged 30 to 90 days presenting to the ED for a fever without source but are found to have a positive urine analysis.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all infants aged 30 to 90 days, presenting to the Montreal Children's Hospital ED from October 2001 to August 2005 who underwent an LP for bacterial culture, in addition to urinalysis and blood and urine cultures. Descriptive statistics and their corresponding confidence intervals were used.

Results

Overall, 392 infants were identified using the microbiology laboratory database. Fifty-seven patients had an abnormal urinalysis. Of these, 1 infant (71 days old) had an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection, bacteremia, and meningitis. This patient, however, was not well on history, and the peripheral white blood cell count was low at 2.9 × 10⁹/L. Thus, the negative predictive value of an abnormal urinalysis for meningitis was 98.2%.

Conclusions

Routine LPs are not required in infants (30–90 days) presenting to the ED with a fever and a positive urinalysis if they are considered at low risk for serious bacterial infection based on clinical and laboratory criteria. However, we recommend that judicious clinical judgment be used; in doubt, an LP should be performed before empiric antibiotic therapy is begun.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^c320cc66]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

WBC cutoffs and urine cultures performed and prevented

We graphically represented the expected results of applying various WBC cutoffs, the urinalysis parameter with the highest AUC value (Figure 2). Without a cutoff, 100% (n = 80,949) cultures would be performed. In contrast, using a cutoff of > 50 WBCs/HPF, only 20% of urine cultures would be performed (n = 16,495). Additionally, with increasing WBC cutoff thresholds, the number of "non-actionable cultures" prevented also increased, from 1.5% (n = 1254) of total cultures at a cutoff of ≥ 3 WBCs/HPF to 58% of total cultures (n = 46,554) at a cutoff of > 50 WBCs/HPF (Figure 2). Similarly, among all urine culture (n = 80,949), the number of cultures positive for a uropathogen that would have been missed with reflex testing rose from n = 255 (0.3% of all urine tests) at a cutoff of ≥ 3 WBC/HPF to n = 17,900 (22%) at a cutoff of > 50 WBCs/HPF (Figure 2). Among the urine cultures prevented, as the proportion of "non-actionable cultures" decreased with WBC cutoffs, from 83% at a cutoff of ≥ 3 WBCs /HPF to 72% at the highest threshold. The percent of cultures positive for a uropathogen missed increased from 17% to 28% as the WBC cutoff rose (Figure 2). When examining the proportion of positive urine cultures for a uropathogen prevented (and excluding the ≥ 3 WBC cutoff, which only excluded 1.8% of urine cultures from being done), the ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF show the lowest proportion of "positive urine cultures for a uropathogen" prevented (18%) when compared to the higher WBCs cutoff thresholds (22–28%) (Figure 2).

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) culture methods — dipslide performance and use: Alternative culture methods such as dipslides may have a place in the office setting with sensitivity reported in the range of 87% to 100% and specificity 92% to 98%, but dipslides cannot specify the organism or antimicrobial sensitivities; practices that use dipslides should do so in collaboration with a certified laboratory for identification and sensitivity testing or, in the absence of such results, may need to perform "test of cure" cultures after 24 hours of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^2a649834]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — synovial fluid testing and diagnostic ranges: Regardless of how joint fluid is obtained, an adequate volume of fluid should be submitted to the laboratory rather than a culture swab, and synovial fluid WBC count and Gram stain should be performed, with the WBC count an important but rough guide that should be interpreted in clinical context. In ABA, joint fluid WBC counts are usually greater than 50 000/μl and often exceed 100 000/μl with a neutrophil predominance, whereas transient nonbacterial synovitis commonly shows 5000 to 15 000/μl with mononuclear predominance, and in JIA it is typically < 50 000/μl. Lyme arthritis may mimic ABA, with over half of pediatric cases exceeding 50 000 WBC/μl; in one Lyme-endemic study, children with intermediate (25 000 to 75 000 cells/mm3) hip-joint WBC counts were most likely to have ABA, followed by Lyme arthritis and then transient nonbacterial synovitis. Two small recent studies suggest potential moderate utility of urine dipstick leukocyte esterase test results on synovial fluid as a rapid discriminator of infection, but further validation is required.
