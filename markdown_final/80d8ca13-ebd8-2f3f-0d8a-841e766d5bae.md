## Question

Latent Tuberculosis treatment guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why LTBI treatment matters. Then, I should verify the scope and methodology of the guidelines. Next, I will extract and compare the recommended regimens, including preferred and alternatives, and appraise the evidence quality. After that, I need to check special populations, drug–drug interactions, and what to do with drug-resistant exposures. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key implementation points, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why we treat LTBI. Untreated LTBI carries a roughly 5–10% lifetime risk of progression to active TB, with most U.S. TB cases arising from progression of untreated LTBI, so treating LTBI reduces individual risk and has public health impact; I should double-check those figures, and yes, they are consistent across CDC and USPSTF summaries [^47070cdd] [^e6d7c438].

> Next, I should review the guideline scope and methodology. The 2020 CDC/NTCA update applies to persons with LTBI in the United States presumed to have isoniazid- and rifampin-susceptible infection; it does not cover multidrug-resistant exposures, which are addressed separately, and it explicitly excluded cost-effectiveness and programmatic implementation from the evidence appraisal, focusing on effectiveness and hepatotoxicity using GRADE and network meta-analysis; I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond that scope, and the documents confirm these boundaries [^0f8b8dab] [^47d70c95] [^6566b465].

> I will now examine the preferred regimens and their evidence base. The three preferred options are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP), 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin; these are preferred because they achieve similar or noninferior effectiveness versus 9 months of isoniazid with better tolerability and higher completion, and the network meta-analysis shows substantial reductions in TB risk versus no treatment for these shorter rifamycin-based regimens; wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and HIV applicability, because I initially thought 4 months of rifampin had no HIV data, but hold on, I should correct that: 4 months of rifampin is strongly recommended for HIV-negative persons, with no direct HIV evidence in the CDC/NTCA review, whereas WHO includes rifampin-based regimens across HIV statuses, so I need to be precise about the U.S. versus global evidence base here [^2581c1a7] [^fc248ed4] [^5397a33e] [^f9f219c6].

> Let me consider the alternative regimens and their trade-offs. Six months of daily isoniazid is strongly recommended when rifamycins are contraindicated or interactions preclude their use, and 9 months of daily isoniazid is conditionally recommended; both are efficacious but have higher hepatotoxicity risk and lower completion, which diminishes real-world effectiveness; I should confirm the hepatotoxicity signal, and yes, pooled analyses show higher hepatotoxicity with isoniazid compared with rifampin, reinforcing the preference for shorter rifamycin regimens when feasible [^8fb75788] [^288eb01a].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and drug–drug interactions before recommending rifamycins broadly. For people with HIV, 3HP is recommended when antiretroviral interactions are acceptable, and rifabutin can be substituted for rifampin when interactions are problematic; rifapentine has fewer interactions than rifampin, but I need to check current HIV drug–drug interaction tables before choosing a regimen; in pregnancy, rifapentine is not currently recommended, so isoniazid-based regimens are typically used; in children, 3HP is recommended from age 2 years and can be given by DOT or self-administered therapy, with pediatric safety data supporting use; I should confirm these age and interaction caveats, and the CDC updates and HIV OI guidance align with this approach [^c5e49fe3] [^03bc66b8] [^dad4ec9e] [^1bae441e].

> Next, I should review what to do when exposure involves drug-resistant TB. For contacts to MDR-TB, the CDC/ATS/ERS guideline suggests offering LTBI therapy with a later-generation fluoroquinolone for 6–12 months, guided by the source-case susceptibilities, and advises against routine use of pyrazinamide because of toxicity; I need to ensure I don't conflate this with drug-susceptible LTBI guidance, and yes, this MDR contact management is a separate, conditional recommendation with very low certainty, so shared decision-making and expert input are essential [^bb865a5a] [^2309a1fa].

> I should double-check the practical decision framework. Preferred rifamycin-based regimens are first-line when there are no contraindications; choose among 3HP, 4 months of rifampin, or 3 months of isoniazid plus rifampin based on patient preference, logistics, and interaction profile; if rifamycins are not feasible, use 6 months of isoniazid, reserving 9 months for select cases or when 6 months is not sufficient; always exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy, and coordinate with HIV clinicians on antiretroviral interactions; this aligns with CDC/NTCA and contemporary summaries [^2581c1a7] [^a8c1c61e].

> But wait, what about implementation details that affect completion and safety. I need to ensure I note that 3HP is ideally observed, though self-administration is acceptable in some settings, and that rifampin and rifapentine are not interchangeable, so medication verification is critical; additionally, baseline and symptom-triggered liver monitoring is prudent, especially for isoniazid-containing regimens or those with liver disease risk factors, even though routine lab monitoring is not mandated for all patients; these cautions are emphasized in CDC materials and expert summaries [^c5e49fe3] [^fe2586b0] [^a8c1c61e].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. Short-course rifamycin-based regimens are preferred over longer isoniazid monotherapy because they achieve comparable or better effectiveness with better tolerability and higher completion, thereby improving real-world prevention of progression; isoniazid remains an effective alternative when rifamycins are unsuitable, and MDR contacts require a different, fluoroquinolone-based approach; this synthesis matches the GRADE-informed, evidence-based ranking in the 2020 CDC/NTCA guideline and is consistent with WHO's broader endorsement of shorter preventive regimens [^2581c1a7] [^f9f219c6].

Current guidelines recommend **short-course rifamycin-based regimens** (3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine [3HP], 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin) as preferred therapy for latent TB infection (LTBI) because they are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than longer isoniazid-only regimens [^2581c1a7] [^a8c1a61e]. Isoniazid for 6 or 9 months remains an **alternative** when rifamycins are contraindicated or not tolerated, with 6 months favored in HIV-negative patients and 9 months considered when 6 months is insufficient or in high-risk groups [^8fb75788] [^37fba330]. All regimens require exclusion of active TB before starting, and regimen choice should be individualized based on comorbidities, drug interactions, and patient preferences [^04c146e2] [^a8c1a61e].

---

## Recommended treatment regimens

The CDC and NTCA recommend the following regimens for LTBI, categorized as **preferred** or **alternative** based on effectiveness, safety, and completion rates:

| **Regimen** | **Duration** | **Recommendation strength** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Isoniazid + rifapentine (3HP) | 3 months, once weekly | Strong | Moderate |
| Rifampin | 4 months, daily | Strong | Moderate |
| Isoniazid + rifampin | 3 months, daily | Conditional | Low |
| Isoniazid | 6 months, daily | Strong (HIV-negative); Conditional (HIV-positive) | Moderate |
| Isoniazid | 9 months, daily | Conditional | Moderate |

---

Preferred regimens are **short-course rifamycin-based options** with high effectiveness, favorable safety profiles, and higher completion rates, whereas alternative regimens are longer isoniazid-only courses used when rifamycins are contraindicated or not tolerated [^2581c1a7] [^a8c1a61e].

---

## Evidence supporting recommended regimens

- **3HP (isoniazid + rifapentine)**: Noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid in preventing active TB, with higher completion rates and less hepatotoxicity; suitable for adults and children ≥ 2 years, including HIV-positive patients when drug interactions are manageable [^c5e49fe3] [^d9e0c1be].

- **4 months of rifampin**: Clinically equivalent to 9 months of isoniazid, with lower hepatotoxicity and higher completion rates; strong recommendation for HIV-negative patients; limited evidence in HIV-positive patients [^5397a33e] [^fcc50cc6].

- **3 months of isoniazid + rifampin**: Effective and safe alternative, particularly useful when rifapentine is unavailable or contraindicated; conditional recommendation due to lower-quality evidence [^869b70f1] [^72352693].

- **6 months of isoniazid**: Strongly recommended for HIV-negative patients; effective but associated with higher hepatotoxicity and lower completion rates than rifamycin-based regimens [^8fb75788] [^288eb01a].

- **9 months of isoniazid**: Conditionally recommended for high-risk patients or when 6 months is deemed insufficient; historically considered the standard regimen [^8fb75788] [^37fba330].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **HIV-positive patients**: 3HP is recommended when drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy are manageable; rifampin-based regimens may require adjustment of antiretroviral therapy; isoniazid remains an alternative when rifamycins are contraindicated [^c5e49fe3] [^dad4ec9e].

- **Pregnant women**: Isoniazid regimens are preferred; rifapentine is not currently recommended during pregnancy [^dad4ec9e].

- **Children**: 3HP is recommended for children ≥ 2 years; rifampin-based regimens are safe and effective alternatives [^c5e49fe3] [^d9e0c1be].

- **Patients with liver disease**: Rifamycin-based regimens are preferred due to lower hepatotoxicity risk compared to isoniazid [^fc248ed4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Baseline clinical assessment and symptom review are essential to exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy [^04c146e2]. Routine laboratory monitoring is not required for all patients but is recommended for those with liver disease, HIV infection, or other risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Patients should be educated to report symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain) promptly [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing regimen selection

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, pregnancy, liver function, HIV status, and medication interactions [^a8c1a61e].

- **Patient preferences**: Convenience, pill burden, and potential side effects [^a8c1a61e].

- **Clinical judgment**: Risk of progression to active TB, likelihood of adherence, and availability of healthcare resources [^a8c1a61e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Short-course rifamycin-based regimens are **preferred** for LTBI treatment due to their effectiveness, safety, and higher completion rates. Isoniazid-only regimens remain alternatives when rifamycins are contraindicated or not tolerated. Regimen selection should be individualized, considering patient-specific factors, preferences, and clinical judgment, with active TB excluded before initiation [^2581c1a7] [^a8c1a61e].

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221-47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g., with low-quality evidence).These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93-e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens.In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6-9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Current and future treatments for tuberculosis [^4fab62f3]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Guidelines on the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have essentially remained the same for the past 35 years, but are now starting to change. Ongoing clinical trials will hopefully transform the landscape for treatment of drug sensitive TB, drug resistant TB, and latent TB infection. Multiple trials are evaluating novel agents, repurposed agents, adjunctive host directed therapies, and novel treatment strategies that will increase the probability of success of future clinical trials. Guidelines for HIV-TB co-infection treatment continue to be updated and drug resistance testing has been revolutionized in recent years with the shift from phenotypic to genotypic testing and the concomitant increased speed of results. These coming changes are long overdue and are sorely needed to address the vast disparities in global TB incidence rates. TB is currently the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious agent, but the work of many researchers and the contributions of many patients in clinical trials will reduce the substantial global morbidity and mortality of the disease.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

Other Considerations

Following are several considerations for the use of these guidelines. First, the committee did not include cost-effectiveness in evaluating the evidence; recommendations were based on evaluating effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens. Second, the committee did not evaluate evidence regarding how to implement these regimens programmatically (e.g. who to test and treat and management of side effects). Third, these guidelines focus on treatment regimens for persons with LTBI living in countries with low TB disease incidence. These guidelines do not address other empiric TB prevention strategies (e.g. 1 month of isoniazid plus rifapentine among HIV-positive persons living in settings with a high TB incidence regardless of results from the TST or an interferon-gamma release assay). Finally, shorter regimens should not be used for patients in whom rifamycins are contraindicated, including those taking medications with significant drug-drug interactions with rifamycins.

Introduction

One fourth of the global population (approximately 2 billion persons) is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including approximately 13 million in the United States. Most infected persons are asymptomatic and classified as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). If untreated, approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease during their lifetime (–). Progression from untreated LTBI accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB disease cases. Treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression to TB disease. The most recent comprehensive guidelines for treatment of LTBI in the United States were published in 2000. In 2003, CDC and the American Thoracic Society recommended against use of the 2-month regimen of rifampin plus pyrazinamide because of the risk for severe hepatotoxicity. Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update the 2000 and 2003 treatment guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review of clinical trials for the treatment of LTBI. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were applied to the evidence of effectiveness, a network meta-analysis of selected evidence was performed, and the evidence was used to support 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines.

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines apply to persons with LTBI who live in the United States. In addition, these guidelines apply to persons infected with M. tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin; they do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.­

Summary

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.

The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g. with low-quality evidence).

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^47d70c95]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

These updated guidelines were developed by NTCA and CDC. The LTBI treatment guidelines committee members, who are the authors of this report, were nominated on the basis of their expertise in treatment of LTBI. The committee had expertise in epidemiology, domestic and international TB control, clinical trials, and treatment of LTBI in adults and children. A methodologist with expertise in the GRADE approach served as a consultant to the guideline development committee.

Evidence Search

The committee determined that the following clinical question should be addressed in the updated guidelines: “Which regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection have the greatest effectiveness and least toxicity?” The question was written in the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format, and then the outcomes were rated as critical, important, or not important. Comparison of regimen toxicities was limited to hepatotoxicity because this was the only toxicity that could be consistently compared across studies.

A systematic literature review was initiated in December 2017. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and gray literature were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. Search terms included “latent tuberculosis,” “latent TB,” “LTBI,” “ Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ” “tuberculosis infection” AND “isoniazid,” “rifampin,” “rifapentine,” or “pyrazinamide.” Articles were included if the study design was a randomized controlled trial and outcomes included prevention of TB disease and drug-related hepatotoxicity. Studies that included persons with suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded from the review.

The initial search located a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis published in August 2017 that examined the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. The study authors were contacted and asked for access to the extracted data. Study characteristics, types of participants, interventions, the outcomes measured, and results were extracted from each study. If the data were amenable to pooling, effects were estimated via meta-analysis. For the meta-analyses, a random effects model was used unless otherwise specified, and effect estimates were reported as odds ratios. All statistical analyses were conducted using the “metafor” package in R, versions 3.4.3. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to conduct a bias assessment. Analyses conducted in 2018 included combined data from the studies in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018 (Figure).

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) guideline rationale—recommendations were formulated considering the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility, and these factors informed a preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates.

Latent tuberculosis infection guideline—recommendation strength and regimen prioritization defined a strong GRADE recommendation as when desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences, most well-informed patients would choose the regimen, and evidence was at least moderate quality; a conditional GRADE recommendation applied when uncertainty remained about that balance and indicates that well-informed patients might make different choices. The panel also prioritized regimens as preferred or alternative, with preferred regimens defined as having excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and higher completion rates.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^1e6f4a45]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection guideline—evidence appraisal and recommendation development used the GRADE approach and GRADEpro software to create evidence profiles for each outcome (high, moderate, low, or very low); head-to-head trial comparisons were evaluated by population (adults, children, HIV positive, and HIV negative). The committee discussed evidence during face-to-face meetings and teleconferences, prioritized GRADE evidence tables based on regimens, comparisons, and study populations most clinically relevant to the United States, and prioritized the GRADE comparisons when discrepancies with network meta-analysis occurred. Recommendations were based on the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, feasibility, and impacts on individuals and public health.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^47070cdd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) epidemiology and guideline scope—If untreated, approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease during their lifetime, and progression from untreated LTBI accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB disease cases; treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression. In 2003, CDC and the American Thoracic Society recommended against use of the 2-month regimen of rifampin plus pyrazinamide because of the risk for severe hepatotoxicity. These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines apply to persons with LTBI who live in the United States and to persons infected with M. tuberculosis who are presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin; they do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^532a6214]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

Methods

A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

Conclusions

These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f9fe23bf]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

Objective

To issue a current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^e4a5ccee]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Development of Recommendations

The committee discussed evidence during face-to-face meetings and teleconferences. GRADE evidence tables were prioritized according to the regimens, comparisons, and study populations that were deemed most clinically relevant to the United States. If discrepancies between GRADE head-to-head comparisons and network meta-analysis results were found, the committee prioritized the GRADE comparisons. Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the following considerations: the balance of desirable consequences of the intervention (benefits) and undesirable consequences (regimen complexity, adverse effects, and cost), the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. The desirable and undesirable consequences considered by the committee included both those related to individuals and to overall public health.

A strong GRADE recommendation for a regimen was made if the panel concluded that the desirable consequences of the intervention outweighed the undesirable consequences, the majority of well-informed patients would choose the regimen, and the evidence was at least moderate quality. A conditional GRADE recommendation was made for a regimen when uncertainty existed regarding whether the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences (e.g. low-quality evidence for a critical outcome such that additional evidence could change key findings, hence the recommendation). A conditional recommendation indicates that well-informed patients might make different choices regarding whether to choose the regimen.

The panel also prioritized recommended regimens as either preferred or alternative. Preferred regimens were defined as having excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and higher completion rates. Alternative regimens were defined as having excellent efficacy but longer treatment duration and lower completion rates. The rationale for prioritizing the regimens was that treatment completion rates are higher with shorter regimens ; if regimens have similar efficacy and safety, the shorter regimen is more effective because completion rates are higher.

Draft recommendations were publicly presented during the U.S. Advisory Council on the Elimination of Tuberculosis meeting on December 11, 2018, and at the NTCA meeting on April 23, 2019.

Summary of Evidence and Recommendations

The recommended treatment regimens include three preferred and two alternative treatment regimens (Tables 3 and 4). Rifamycin-based regimens, including 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin are the preferred recommended regimens because of their effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; although efficacious, they have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates, which decrease effectiveness. On the basis of the most recent comprehensive LTBI treatment guidelines in the United States, which were published in 2000, 9 months of daily isoniazid was considered the standard comparator regimen to evaluate shorter-course regimens. Data on the effectiveness and toxicity of 9 months of daily isoniazid are provided, as are data on the other recommended regimens. A rifamycin-based regimen refers to treatment that includes either rifampin or rifapentine.

Discussion

A systematic literature review was performed of clinical trial data pertaining to effectiveness and toxicity of treatment of LTBI, including studies published since the 2018 World Health Organization LTBI guidelines. Evidence quality was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and a network meta-analysis was performed, updated to include data from studies published since a previous network meta-analysis, to compare regimens not evaluated head-to-head in clinical trials.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. These factors also informed the priority rank of the regimens as preferred or alternative, with preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates. This combination of characteristics should result in greater effectiveness of the shorter regimens in clinical settings. More effective treatment of LTBI will facilitate TB elimination. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen.

Although 9 months of isoniazid was a preferred regimen in the guidelines published in 2000, both 6 and 9 months of isoniazid were recommended at that time. In these current guidelines, application of GRADE criteria resulted in a strong recommendation for 6 months of isoniazid as an alternative for those persons unable to take a shorter preferred regimen (e.g. due to drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions), particularly in HIV-negative persons. The longer duration of isoniazid could increase the risk for hepatotoxicity and although increased effectiveness is plausible, the two treatment durations have not been directly compared.

Two months of rifampin plus pyrazinamide are not recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the hepatotoxicity risk. However, in persons treated empirically for TB disease with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 2 months, this regimen will effectively treat LTBI in persons subsequently determined to have LTBI rather than TB disease.

Treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Tracing contacts of infectious pulmonary TB cases (sputum smear-positive) for exposure to tubercle bacilli leading to latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treatment of latently-infected individuals at high risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease has proven extremely effective in the control of TB in the United States and other low TB-burden countries. Treatment of LTBI in infected persons substantially reduces the likelihood of activation of dormant infection and subsequent development of active TB disease (Figure 1). The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2000 for the treatment of LTBI which were also endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Pediatrics. An update to these guidelines was published in 2005 that also included recommendations for pediatric subjects. The treatment options currently available for LTBI are summarized in Table 2.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)—six or nine months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages, and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and can cause hepatotoxicity with discontinuation because of adverse effects, which are more common in adults than children. In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST in settings with low TB incidence, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain. Among HIV-positive persons living in areas with a high TB incidence, isoniazid is complementary to antiretroviral therapy, and Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that isoniazid plus antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence of TB disease to a greater extent than either isoniazid alone or antiretroviral therapy alone; potential disadvantages include long duration, hepatotoxicity, and low treatment completion rates.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)—in comparisons of daily isoniazid plus rifampin for 3 months with isoniazid monotherapy, HIV-negative adults and children with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) had a similar risk for TB disease, hepatotoxicity, and adverse effects requiring discontinuation as those who received 6 months of isoniazid; among children aged <15 years, a 3-month course of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared as effective as a 6-month or longer course of isoniazid with no differences in TB disease, discontinuation due to adverse effects, or hepatotoxicity. In HIV-positive persons, no difference was found in the incidence of TB disease between those who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin and those who received ≥6 months of isoniazid monotherapy, with hepatotoxicity less frequent in the shorter course but discontinuation for adverse effects more frequent; important considerations include potential drug interactions with rifampin and acquired drug resistance if TB disease is not adequately excluded, and hepatotoxicity risk might be higher when isoniazid is given together than with rifampin as when each drug is given alone.

According to the results of the systematic review process, among HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy was highly effective, and the effect of other durations was unknown. An additional analysis found that 9 months of daily isoniazid therapy was perhaps more effective than 6 months and similar to 12 months; however, no clinical trial data were available directly comparing 9 months of isoniazid to placebo, 6 months of isoniazid, or 12 months of isoniazid.

Latent TB Terminology: Origins, Evolution, and Pervasion/Pervasiveness

Since 1971, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has regularly issued TB treatment guidelines. In 1994, these guidelines issued recommendations for the treatment of TB disease and TB infection with no mention of the word “latent” (–). In 1999, the ATS issued for the first time a separate guideline that specifically addressed “latent tuberculosis infection” Not only did the terminology for TB infection change to LTBI, the terminology for its treatment also changed—from “preventive treatment” to “treatment of LTBI.” The recommended treatment for LTBI (isoniazid monotherapy) remained unchanged from that for its namesake (TB infection) in 1994. The 1999 guidelines offered neither an explanation for the new name nor a definition. Rather, the definition was in a separate document published contemporaneously that contained guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. Here, LTBI was defined as “a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST), negative bacteriologic studies (if done), and no clinical, bacteriologic or radiologic evidence of active tuberculosis”. In 2017, the updated guidelines modified the LTBI definition to “a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB.”.

The influential role of the ATS guidelines is reflected by endorsements from key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is not surprising then that their changed terminology for the exact same clinical condition—radiological evidence of inactive TB and/or TB immunoreactivity—had a profound influence on the field. Indeed, a PubMed search suggests this, showing a surge of papers using the term “latent tuberculosis” starting in 2000 (Figure 1). We did, however, find occasional indexed papers on latent TB as far back as 1894. Surely, the definition of latent TB in the 19th and early 20th century papers could not have been the same as the current one, given that the earliest articles predated tuberculin testing. What could latent TB have meant in the pretuberculin era? To understand this, we took our search back further, and identified the term “phthisie latent” (latent phthisis) in papers as early as 1819. Thus, the concept of latent TB predated not only tuberculin testing but also, by more than 60 years, the discovery of the tubercle bacillus.

### Management of latent tuberculosis infection (...) [^a8c1c61e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

According to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, “preferred” medications for managing LTBI have excellent tolerability and efficacy and shorter treatment duration and higher completion rates than longer regimens. “Alternative” medications have excellent efficacy but longer treatment duration, which may lower completion rates. A “strong” recommendation is one for which a panel of experts has confidence that the benefits of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects; a “conditional” recommendation indicates one for which the benefits of adherence outweigh undesirable effects, but the panel is not confident. Treatment regimens were ranked on level of evidence available. 1 Recommended preferred and alternative regimens that have at least moderate evidence are summarized below. Rifamycin-based regimens are preferred therapy because they are effective, safe, and associated with higher adherence rates than longer isoniazid regimens.

Compared with 9 months of isoniazid, 4 months of daily rifampin had higher treatment completion, defined as receipt of more than 80% of doses within the study-defined time of 12 months for rifampin. Three months of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine is strongly recommended in all adults with LTBI. Isoniazid for either 6 or 9 months is an alternative to rifamycin regimens for individuals at risk for drug interactions or those experiencing adverse effects with the aforementioned regimens. Nine months of isoniazid is conditionally recommended. Six months of isoniazid is strongly recommended for HIV-negative patients and conditionally recommended for patients with HIV. involves a considerably shorter treatment duration.

8 Because shorter rifamycin-based regimens are efficacious, well tolerated, and result in increased rates of treatment completion, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that clinicians prescribe rifamycins after explaining the negligible risk of nitrosamine impurities and the risks and benefits of isoniazid.
7. Current guidelines recommend shorter rifamycin-based regimens over isoniazid treatment. Isoniazid remains an effective, strongly recommended alternative for patients who are unable to complete rifamycin-based treatment. The algorithm in the Figure, based on the latest evidence and expert recommendations, has not been validated but may be helpful for clinicians in the US. Shared decision-making, which takes into account patient characteristics, preferences, and potential risks, is key to successful LTBI treatment.

### Relevance of latent TB infection in areas of high TB prevalence [^b7fa50ea]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

About one-third of the world population has latent TB infection (LTBI), the majority of which is distributed in 22 high-burden countries. Early diagnosis and treatment of active TB remains the top priority in resource-poor countries with high TB prevalence. Notwithstanding, because LTBI contributes significantly to the pool of active TB cases later on, its diagnosis and treatment is essential, especially in high-risk groups. The lack of a gold standard and several limitations of currently available tools, namely the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays, are major constraints for LTBI diagnosis. In areas with high TB prevalence, interferon-γ release assays have not shown superiority over the conventional tuberculin skin test and are yet to be systematically studied. Decisions regarding LTBI treatment with isoniazid preventive therapy should be made, keeping in mind the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance in these settings. Although efforts to shorten the LTBI treatment duration are encouraging, most trials have focused on adherence and toxicity. Future trials on short-duration regimens in high-burden settings should address drug efficacy issues as well. LTBI management, therefore, should comprise a targeted screening approach and individualization of LTBI treatment protocols. In addition, efforts should focus on airborne infection control measures in high-burden countries. A high prevalence of drug-resistant TB, the HIV epidemic, and delays in the diagnosis of active TB cases are other major concerns in areas of high TB prevalence. There is ample space for further research in these countries, whose outcomes may strengthen future national guidelines.

Abbreviation: LTBI = latent tuberculosis infection.

* Existing systematic review search: the results from the 2017 analysis were published, citing all primary studies included in the analysis (Zenner D, Beer N, Harris RJ, Lipman MC, Stagg HR, van der Werf MJ. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: an updated network meta-analysis. Ann Intern Med 2017;167:248–5). Updated search: analyses included combined data from the studies included in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018.

All treatment regimens were analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) approach, which allowed for indirect comparisons of treatment regimens when direct comparisons were not available. However, direct, pairwise meta-analysis was the preferred method; the results of the network analysis are presented in this report only if no direct comparisons were available. A full description of the network analysis method has been previously published. NMA allows for indirect comparisons of treatment regimens through inference from a network of evidence. For this analysis, WinBUGS software (version 1.4; Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit of the University of Cambridge) was used to create the Bayesian network with posterior distributions on the basis of 20,000 samples after a burn-in period of 10,000 iterations. Convergence was assessed by inspecting parameter chains and the Gelman–Rubin diagnostic. Summary statistics and 95% credible intervals were obtained from posterior distributions. Network inconsistency, which can arise if indirect comparisons conflict with direct pairwise estimates, was assessed by comparison with standard meta-analysis and by using the omnibus test for consistency.

The overall quality of evidence was appraised using the GRADE approach, and GRADEpro software was used to develop evidence profiles that summarized the quality of evidence for each outcome (high, moderate, low, or very low) and the rationale for the quality of evidence appraisal. Head-to-head comparisons of regimens evaluated in clinical trials were evaluated according to the populations studied: adults, children, HIV positive, and HIV negative. References for all of the studies included in the analyses are available (Supplementary Tables;).

Alternative Regimens: Six or Nine Months of Daily Isoniazid

Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive TST, including HIV-negative adults and children, HIV-positive adults, and presumably also HIV-positive children. The drug can cause hepatotoxicity and be associated with discontinuation because of adverse effects, although these effects are more common in adults than children.

In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain in settings with low TB incidence. For these HIV-positive persons, the potential exists for a reduction in the incidence of TB disease and an increase in adverse effects with isoniazid therapy; however, the likelihood of these effects remains uncertain because of wide confidence intervals resulting from too few events.

The evidence synthesis included multiple durations of isoniazid therapy in persons with a positive TST (3, 6, and 12 months in HIV-negative persons and 6 months in HIV-positive persons). Among HIV-negative persons with inactive TB (defined as the presence of tuberculin positivity, stable fibrotic lung lesions, and negative sputum cultures in persons not previously treated), 6 and 12 months of therapy were more effective than 3 months of therapy, demonstrating the benefit of LTBI treatment with isoniazid in this high-risk subset of patients with LTBI. Studies of other regimens have persons with LTBI and fibrotic lesions but in much smaller numbers. According to the results of the systematic review process, among HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy was highly effective, and the effect of other durations was unknown. Also reviewed was an analysis that included different, fewer trials than included in this report and found that 9 months of daily isoniazid therapy was perhaps more effective than 6 months and similar to 12 months (,–). However, no clinical trial data were available directly comparing 9 months of isoniazid to placebo, 6 months of isoniazid, or 12 months of isoniazid.

Recommendations for regimens to treat latent tuberculosis infection

Abbreviation: HIV = human immunodeficiency virus.

* Preferred: excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, higher completion rates than longer regimens and therefore higher effectiveness; alternative: excellent efficacy but concerns regarding longer treatment duration, lower completion rates, and therefore lower effectiveness.

† No evidence reported in HIV-positive persons.

§ Strong recommendation for those persons unable to take a preferred regimen (e.g. due to drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions).

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with. In summary, short-course rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances. Introduction One fourth of the global population is estimated to be infected with. The initial search located a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis published in August 2017 that examined the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. Rifamycin-based regimens, including 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin are the preferred recommended regimens because of their effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. These factors also informed the priority rank of the regimens as preferred or alternative, with preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates.

This combination of characteristics should result in greater effectiveness of the shorter regimens in clinical settings. More effective treatment of LTBI will facilitate TB elimination rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6a6bdbcb]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

### Primary care screening and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^288eb01a]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Five to ten percent of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Identifying and treating LTBI is a key component of the strategy for reducing the burden of TB disease.

Objective

To review the evidence about targeted screening and treatment for LTBI among adults in primary care settings to support the US Preventive Services Task Force in updating its 1996 recommendation.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries, searched through August 3, 2015; references from pertinent articles; and experts. Literature surveillance was conducted through May 31, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies of LTBI screening, LTBI treatment with recommended pharmacotherapy, or accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Studies of individuals for whom LTBI screening and treatment is part of public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. When at least 3 similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled estimates of outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, reliability, active TB disease, mortality, hepatotoxicity, and other harms.

Results

The review included 72 studies (n=51 711). No studies evaluated benefits and harms of screening compared with no screening. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of the TST at both 5-mm and 10-mm induration thresholds were 0.79 (5-mm: 95% CI, 0.69-0.89 [8 studies, n=803]; 10 mm: 95% CI, 0.71-0.87 [11 studies; n=988]), and those for IGRAs ranged from 0.77 to 0.90 (57 studies; n=4378). Pooled estimates for specificity of the TST at the 10-mm and 15-mm thresholds and for IGRAs ranged from 0.95 to 0.99 (34 studies; n=23 853). A randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 24 weeks of isoniazid in individuals with pulmonary fibrotic lesions and LTBI (n=27 830) found a reduction in absolute risk of active TB at 5 years from 1.4% to 0.5% (relative risk [RR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24-0.52]) and an increase in absolute risk for hepatoxicity from 0.1% to 0.5% (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03-10.39]) for 24 weeks of daily isoniazid compared with placebo. An RCT (n=6886) found that 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid was noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid alone for preventing active TB. The risk difference for hepatoxicity comparing isoniazid with rifampin ranged from 3% to 7%, with a pooled RR of 3.29 (95% CI, 1.72-6.28 [3 RCTs; n=1327]).

Conclusions and Relevance

No studies evaluated the benefits and harms of screening compared with no screening. Both the TST and IGRAs are moderately sensitive and highly specific within countries with low TB burden. Treatment reduced the risk of active TB among the populations included in this review. Isoniazid is associated with higher rates of hepatotoxicity than placebo or rifampin.

Definitions—latent tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)/TB infection (TBI) is defined as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by antigens of bacteria in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex without any clinical, radiographic, or microbiologic evidence of disease; people with LTBI/TBI are not contagious and have no signs or symptoms of tuberculosis disease, yet they are at increased risk for developing TB disease and becoming contagious, and diagnosing and treating LTBI/TBI can help prevent progression to TB disease. Tuberculosis disease occurs when a person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex has clinical signs and/or symptoms, radiographic evidence, or viable mycobacteria recovered from a clinical specimen, and disease can be pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or both. The terms “active” and “latent” are noted as not universally accepted because there is a continuum from infection to disease, particularly in children who often have paucibacillary disease.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection? [^96c85714]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

Objectives

With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

Methodological Approach

On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

Conclusions and Impact

Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.

Evidence search and Bayesian meta-analysis methods—A systematic literature review was initiated in December 2017, databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and CENTRAL) and gray literature were searched using specified LTBI and drug terms, and inclusion required randomized controlled trials reporting prevention of TB disease and drug-related hepatotoxicity, while studies including suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded; comparison of regimen toxicities was limited to hepatotoxicity. Meta-analyses used a random effects model with odds ratios, analyses used the metafor package in R, version 3.4.3, and bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Analyses conducted in 2018 combined prior studies with those published during June 2017–August 2018. All treatment regimens were analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis when direct comparisons were unavailable, although direct, pairwise meta-analysis was the preferred method and network results were presented only if no direct comparisons were available. For the network analysis, WinBUGS software (version 1.4) generated posterior distributions on the basis of 20,000 samples after a burn-in period of 10,000 iterations, and summary statistics and 95% credible intervals were obtained from posterior distributions.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing—IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children <5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^0d59343f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MDR latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) contacts—treatment recommendations: For contacts with presumed multidrug-resistant (MDR) LTBI due to exposure to an infectious patient with MDR-TB, we suggest offering treatment for LTBI versus following with observation alone. For treatment of MDR LTBI, we suggest 6 to 12 months’ treatment with a fluoroquinolone alone or with a second drug, on the basis of source-case isolate drug susceptibility testing (DST). On the basis of evidence of increased toxicity, adverse events, and discontinuations, pyrazinamide should not be routinely used as the second drug, and in lieu of fluoroquinolone-based treatment there are few data for other second-line medications and, because of toxicity, they are not recommended by experts. For contacts to fluoroquinolone-resistant, pre–extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre–XDR-TB), pyrazinamide/ethambutol may be an effective option if source-case isolate DST shows susceptibility to these drugs, and in children levofloxacin is preferred because of the availability of an oral suspension formulation.

Latent tuberculosis infection—risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (<2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children <5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Update of recommendations for use of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine regimen to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^d9e0c1be]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is critical to the control and elimination of tuberculosis disease (TB) in the United States. In 2011, CDC recommended a short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) by directly observed therapy (DOT) for treatment of LTBI, with limitations for use in children aged <12 years and persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1). CDC identified the use of 3HP in those populations, as well as self-administration of the 3HP regimen, as areas to address in updated recommendations. In 2017, a CDC Work Group conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the 3HP regimen using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis, which determined that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates. In July 2017, the Work Group presented the meta-analysis findings to a group of TB experts, and in December 2017, CDC solicited input from the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 2-17 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or self-administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged ≥2 years.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^42525e2b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### New recommendations for the treatment of tuberculosis [^b6a95c07]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to give practicing physicians a practical approach to the treatment of latent and active tuberculosis and to review newer recommendations and common problems encountered in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis.

Recent Findings

Recently published literature documents the increased incidence of multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the importance of antituberculosis drug toxicities and drug-drug interactions, persistent problems in the correct interpretation of the tuberculin skin test and ongoing problems with treatment compliance and treatment completion.

Summary

This article provides a practical approach to the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test, the proper approach to the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, and a structured approach to the treatment of presumed or documented active tuberculosis infection. Questions about tuberculosis that are often asked of infectious disease and pulmonary specialists are addressed in a very practical manner.

The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) recommends daily therapy with INH for 12 months as it is more effective than the 6-month course (75% vs. 65%). The preferred duration of treatment for most patients with LTBI in the United States and European countries is 9 months since clinical trial data showed that the efficacy of 6-month regimen is reduced to 60% while 12-month regimen is advocated for individuals at higher risk of developing active disease. According to the CDC guidelines, the frequency can also be reduced from daily therapy to twice weekly therapy with increased dosage of INH, however, the twice weekly regimen must be given as directly observed treatment (DOT). Inclusion of DOT adds a substantial additional expense to the treatment strategies. The efficacy of INH treatment in preventing active TB exceeds 90% among persons who complete treatment. However, the overall effectiveness of these regimens is severely limited as the completion rates in clinical settings have been rather low, ranging from 30% to 64% only [-]. Completion rates in other settings have been even lower. Although INH is tolerated fairly well by most of the individuals, there is a risk of hepatic toxicity in selected populations. Studies have shown that 10% to 22% of participants taking INH for LTBI have at least one episode of elevated serum transaminase levels. Although the rates of clinically significant hepatitis were much lower (< 2%), the risk and severity increased with age and concomitant alcohol consumption [-]. INH can also cause peripheral neuropathy but the risk can be lowered by concomitant use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Poor adherence due to the long duration of treatment and concerns for hepatotoxicity in selected patient populations resulted in development of shorter and more effective treatment options for LTBI.

Expert Consultation

In July 2017, CDC met with nine non-CDC subject matter experts in TB and LTBI diagnosis, treatment, prevention, surveillance, epidemiology, clinical research, pulmonology, pediatrics, HIV/AIDS, public health programs, and patient advocacy. CDC presented the systematic review results and proposed recommendations to the experts, who provided 1) individual perspectives on the review; 2) experience with implementation of the 3HP regimen in various settings and populations; and 3) individual viewpoints on the proposed updates. Subject matter experts from programs prescribing 3HP described benefits of this regimen, including increased acceptance and completion of treatment. Some experts reported that several health departments are currently using 3HP, with high treatment completion, in children as young as age 2 years. Some noted that the 2011 recommendation to administer 3HP by DOT limits use of the regimen. In December 2017, CDC solicited input from ACET and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations.

With regard to pediatric use, the 2011 recommendations had included limited use of the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in children aged <12 years. New data on efficacy and safety of 3HP in children were determined sufficient to recommend the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in children aged ≥2 years.

Concerning patients with HIV infection, information about interactions between specific antimycobacterial agents, including rifamycins (e.g. rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine) and antiretroviral agents, is available in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents. These frequently updated guidelines include a section addressing management of LTBI in persons with HIV coinfection and tables with information on drug interactions. * Use of concomitant LTBI treatment and antiretroviral agents should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^c5e49fe3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). High credibility.

Three months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP)—A regimen of 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine is a preferred regimen that is strongly recommended for adults and children aged >2 years, including HIV-positive persons (as drug interactions allow); administered through directly observed therapy, it had equivalent effectiveness and was not more toxic than 9 months of daily isoniazid, and treatment completion rates were higher with the 3-month regimen; in HIV-negative persons it was equivalent to and associated with less hepatotoxicity than 9 months of isoniazid despite more discontinuation because of adverse effects, while in HIV-positive persons no significant difference was found versus either 6 or 9 months of isoniazid; the completion rate for self-administered therapy was inferior to direct observation but noninferior in a prespecified United States subpopulation, and treatment completion is highest with directly observed therapy, although self-administered therapy is an approved option; potential disadvantages include pill burden (10 pills once weekly compared with two or three pills daily), a systemic drug reaction or influenza-like syndrome with severe events requiring hospitalization in 0.1% of persons, the reaction being self-limited and usually mild with no deaths reported, and important considerations of potential drug interactions and acquired drug resistance if TB disease is not adequately excluded.

Three Months of Daily Isoniazid Plus Rifampin

A regimen of 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin is a preferred treatment that is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages and for HIV-positive persons as drug interactions allow. HIV-negative adults and children with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared to have a similar risk for TB disease, hepatotoxicity, and adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy as those who received ≥6 months of isoniazid. Among children aged <15 years specifically, a 3-month course of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared as effective as a 6-month or longer course of isoniazid, because direct comparisons found no difference in TB disease and no differences in adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy or hepatotoxicity. In HIV-positive persons, no difference was found in the incidence of TB disease among those who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin compared with those who received ≥6 months of isoniazid monotherapy, regardless of whether they were TST positive, TST negative, or anergic. Hepatotoxicity was less frequent among those receiving the shorter course of therapy, although discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was more frequent.

Potential drug interactions with rifampin and acquired drug resistance if TB disease is not adequately excluded also are important considerations (see previous section on 4 months of daily rifampin). In addition, hepatotoxicity risk might be greater with the two drugs given together than with either drug given alone.

Drug-susceptible tuberculosis—diagnostic evaluation and initial management: CDC recommends the use of a rapid molecular test on at least one specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and in a compatible clinical syndrome a positive AFB smear provides strong inferential evidence for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, after which the regimen is continued to complete a standard course of therapy when confirmed by isolation of M. tuberculosis, a positive rapid molecular test, or clinical/radiographic response. In smear-positive but rapid molecular test–negative cases, polymerase chain reaction inhibitors are reported in 2%–5% of M. tuberculosis; if empiric therapy is given yet cultures remain negative without clinical response and IGRA or PPD–TST is positive, latent tuberculosis infection options are: stop treatment if RIF and PZA were included in initial 4-drug therapy administered for at least 2 months; continue RIF with or without INH for a total of 4 months; give 12 weekly doses of INH/RPT by DOT; or continue INH for a total of 9 months. In patients with low suspicion for active tuberculosis who were not initially treated, if cultures remain negative, the IGRA or PPD–TST is positive (≥ 5 mm), and the abnormal chest radiograph is unchanged after 2 months, treatment for latent tuberculosis infection is indicated, and if not previously treated these patients have case rates 2.5–19 times higher than those with normal chest radiographs. When suspicion is low, treatment may begin with combination chemotherapy or be deferred until additional data clarify the situation (usually within 2 months), and an advantage of early combination chemotherapy is that the patient will have completed 2 months of combination treatment that can be applied to the total duration of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection; however, treatment for latent tuberculosis infection with a single drug is not initiated until active tuberculosis has been excluded, usually by negative cultures. For complicated diagnostic or management situations, consultation with local and state health departments is advised.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing—two-step strategy considerations are described: Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the panel decided that this is an acceptable trade-off in situations in which the consequences of missing LTBI (ie, not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate therapy (ie, hepatotoxicity). Performing a confirmatory test following an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false-positive results are common among individuals who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the committee's presumption that performing a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify initial false-positive results.

### A systematic review of cost-utility analyses of screening methods in latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk populations [^6e3d9857]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Consolidated Guideline on Tuberculosis and in 2022 the Clinical Standards for TB Infection recommend that testing for and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be undertaken in high-risk groups (household contact > 5 years old and other risks groups including silicosis, dialysis, anti-TNF agent treatment, preparation for transplantation or other risks in national guidelines) for prevention of active TB. This intervention has been included under Pillar 1 of the End TB strategy and is considered a core activity to pursue for TB Elimination. The Guideline and the Standards recommend that testing should be with an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or with a tuberculin skin test (TST) but considered that whilst TST likely required fewer resources than IGRA there was insufficient evidence to suggest that one test was better than the other at predicting progression to active TB. Given the differences in resource use for TST and IGRA, a review of the cost-effectiveness evidence on the use of TST or IGRA in high-risk groups could aid decision makers on the appropriate choice of the most suitable test to utilise to diagnose LTBI infection.

Evidence from studies published before 2010 all consistently point to IGRA being cost-effective, relative to TST in high-risk populations in high income countries. Since 2010, there have been several systematic reviews that have assessed the cost-effectiveness of different testing strategies for LTBI. These reviews have highlighted that studies have generally been of moderate-to-high quality in mostly middle to high income settings and that LTBI screening is most cost-effective if screening is restricted to high-risk groups such as migrants from high-burden countries 

However, reviews have also identified the following weaknesses in studies:
The accuracy of tests in predicting future reactivation to active TB is unknown and not included in models
Model structures fail to account for onward transmission
The lack of consistent methods between studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions

This current review aimed to provide the most up to date evidence on the cost-effectiveness evidence on LTBI testing in high-risk groups—specifically evidence reporting the costs per QALY of different testing strategies to account for some of the inconsistency in methods between studies.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^59a2ff54]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing latent TB infection—All people with HIV should be evaluated for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis, regardless of their epidemiological risk of TB exposure; in programmatic settings in the United States, TB screening has been suboptimal, with only 47% to 69% of people with HIV presenting to care completing initial screening, and 42% of those with LTBI initiating therapy, and the two current diagnostics available in the United States, IGRA and TST, help differentiate those with and without TB infection, but the diagnostic accuracy of TST and IGRA is limited such that a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of LTBI or TB disease and a positive test does not, by itself, mean LTBI therapy is warranted, so decisions about medical and public health management should include epidemiological risk factors, medical history, and other clinical information when interpreting IGRA or TST results.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^dad4ec9e]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in people with HIV—after excluding active TB and other medical contraindications, people with HIV with a positive TB screening test should receive LTBI treatment (AI), and those in close contact with anyone with infectious TB should receive LTBI treatment regardless of screening test results and CD4 count (AII). In the United States, people with HIV who have a negative tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and no recent contact with a person with infectious TB likely will not benefit from LTBI treatment, and preventive therapy is not generally recommended (AIII). LTBI treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART) act independently to decrease TB risk; therefore, the use of both interventions is recommended for people with LTBI and HIV (AI), and deferring ART until after completion of LTBI treatment is not recommended (AI). People with HIV successfully treated for LTBI should not have repeat testing with TST or IGRA. Given important drug–drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral agents, selection of an LTBI regimen will depend on a patient’s current or planned ARV regimen, and use of rifapentine in pregnancy is not currently recommended (BIII).

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^388c58d5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines. Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection; new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease; and the development of novel short-course regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis.

Recent Findings

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Current tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include TST and IGRA, which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in the ongoing trials. Development of short-course regimens are a major advance in treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, 4 months of rifampin, and 1 month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard 9 months of isoniazid.

Summary

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

Four Months of Daily Rifampin

A regimen of 4 months of daily rifampin is a preferred treatment that is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. (No evidence is available for effectiveness in HIV-positive persons.) The effectiveness of this regimen was clinically equivalent to, and less toxic than, the standard regimen of 9 months of daily isoniazid in adults and children. Four months of daily rifampin had noninferior effectiveness in preventing TB disease compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects, a lower rate of hepatotoxicity, and a higher rate of treatment completion.

The potential disadvantages of the rifamycin-based regimens are the many drug interactions, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Rifabutin has fewer or less pronounced drug interactions and may be used in place of rifampin when rifampin is contraindicated due to drug-drug interactions and isoniazid cannot be used. Drug interactions with weekly rifapentine are fewer than with rifampin and appear to be fewer than with rifabutin; therefore, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine could be considered when rifampin is contraindicated, although clinical data are limited. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In HIV-positive persons with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts, the risk for asymptomatic or subclinical TB disease increases, possibly facilitating rifampin resistance if TB disease is inadvertently treated with rifampin monotherapy.

### Joint position statement from the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board and the international psoriasis council on routine testing for latent tuberculosis infection prior to and during treatment of psoriasis patients with IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors [^e0edef1d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection testing in psoriasis patients treated with IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors—evidence appraisal and proposal: The authors state that both the biologic basis for this testing and the evidence for progression of latent TB infection to active disease in clinical settings, in both trials and in real-world practice, are limited and weak for both IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors. They note that international experts have extensively reviewed the roles of IL-17 and IL-23 in TB pathogenesis and the clinical evidence for progression during treatment, and these authorities further suggested several modifications to existing treatment guidelines for these two classes of biologics. In this context, the National Psoriasis Foundation Medical Board and the International Psoriasis Council review clinical evidence supporting the safety of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors regarding the progression of latent TB infection to active disease, and a consensus proposal is presented that urges modifications to existing clinical and regulatory guidelines for the routine testing requirement for latent TB infection prior to and during treatment of psoriasis patients with these newer classes of biologics. The document states that implementing this evidence-based change would avoid unnecessary medical costs, reduce avoidable regulatory burden, alleviate concerns for false positive results, and expedite treatment of patients with psoriasis. Methods state that an evidence-based review was performed examining scientific literature on progression of latent TB to active disease in patients with psoriasis.

### Update of recommendations for use of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine regimen to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^1bae441e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Based on evidence on effectiveness, safety, and treatment completion rates from the systematic review, and after consideration of viewpoints from TB subject matter experts and input from ACET and the public, CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 2–17 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including AIDS, and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or SAT in persons aged ≥2 years.

The health care provider should choose the mode of administration (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to severe forms of TB disease. Use of concomitant LTBI treatment and antiretroviral agents should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions (Box 1).

BOX 1 
Updated recommendations for once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection

CDC continues to recommend use of the short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in adults. With regard to age limits, HIV infection, and administration of the treatment, CDC now also recommends the following:

use of 3HP in persons aged 2–17 years;
use of 3HP in persons with LTBI who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine * ; and
use of 3HP by directly observed therapy (DOT) or self-administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged ≥2 years; the health care provider should choose the mode of administration (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to severe forms of tuberculosis disease.
