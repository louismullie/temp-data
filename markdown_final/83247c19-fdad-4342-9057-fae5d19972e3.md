## Question

What is the definition of arthrogryposis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition of arthrogryposis (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita) and how to frame it in context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and labeling. Then, the core diagnostic definition and qualifying descriptors. Next, I should examine the pathophysiology linking fetal akinesia to fixed contractures. After that, I need to review etiologic heterogeneity across genetic and environmental drivers. I will then quantify epidemiology, distinguish major subtypes, consider prenatal differentiation from fetal akinesia deformation sequence, outline diagnostic evaluation principles, and finally synthesize a concise, reference-backed definition with clinical takeaways [^113qfH2u] [^115ihGCL] [^116FSsrv].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the entity. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, often shortened to "arthrogryposis", is a descriptive umbrella term rather than a single disease, used for conditions unified by multiple congenital contractures; several sources explicitly equate "arthrogryposis" with "arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", which anchors the nomenclature I should use consistently [^114JLYpB] [^116FSsrv].

> Now, I need to define the core clinical criterion and qualifying descriptors. The consistent minimum criterion is the presence of two or more congenital joint contractures involving at least two different body areas, and these contractures are recognizable at birth; they are typically described as non-progressive in terms of the contractures themselves, though associated features and function can evolve with growth and management, and I should be careful not to conflate "non-progressive contractures" with "non-progressive disease course" overall, which would be an overstatement on my part [^116SptQe] [^114uirwJ] [^113qfH2u] [^111d42wA].

> Hold on, let me verify the mechanistic link so I don't jump to conclusions. The unifying pathophysiologic pathway is reduced or absent fetal movement during critical windows of joint development, leading to periarticular connective tissue proliferation and secondary joint fixation; this fetal akinesia mechanism explains why the timing and severity of movement restriction shape the ultimate phenotype from distal arthrogryposis through classic AMC to the severe fetal akinesia deformation sequence spectrum [^113qfH2u] [^111svH14] [^115ihGCL].

> Next, I should review etiologic heterogeneity and not imply a single cause. AMC is etiologically diverse, with more than 400 associated genetic disorders spanning primary skeletal muscle, neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerve including axoglial interactions, spinal cord, and brain pathways, and it also includes extrinsic and maternal factors such as oligohydramnios, uterine anomalies, teratogenic exposures, and congenital infections like Zika; maternal myasthenia gravis is a notable immune-mediated cause via transplacental antibodies, and specific examples such as LGI4-related peripheral hypomyelination underscore the breadth of mechanisms leading to neurogenic AMC [^115ihGCL] [^113qfH2u] [^115kft58] [^111a8sNi].

> I should quantify the epidemiology to contextualize the definition. The most commonly cited overall frequency of AMC is approximately 1 in 3,000 live births, although when the broader fetal akinesia–related spectrum leading to multiple contractures is considered, estimates range from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000; specific phenotypic subsets vary widely by region and ascertainment, for example neurogenic AMC around 4.3 per 100,000 in Europe and extremely low point prevalences for particular distal arthrogryposis subtypes, and I should acknowledge that some sources label this as incidence or frequency interchangeably, which I must interpret cautiously [^113qfH2u] [^116SptQe] [^111svH14] [^1145DjCL] [^111Yjvxm].

> Let me distinguish major subtypes without overgeneralizing. The two largest categories are amyoplasia, typically sporadic and non-genetic with characteristic quadrimelic limb involvement and severe muscle underdevelopment, and distal arthrogryposis, most often autosomal dominant with predominant hands and feet involvement; together these account for roughly 50% to 65% of diagnosed AMC, though I should note this figure derives from cohort experience and classification papers, and emerging genetics such as ACTC1-associated distal arthrogryposis with potential cardiac features remind me that boundaries across skeletal and cardiac muscle biology can blur in select genotypes [^114JLYpB] [^114uirwJ] [^112PfHJe] [^1169rCTr].

> But wait, what about prenatal differentiation when multiple contractures are first detected. I need to check how AMC is separated from FADS and from isolated bilateral clubfeet in utero; advanced ultrasound combined with serial motor assessments before 24 weeks improves discrimination between stable AMC or BPEV and deteriorating FADS, which is crucial for counseling and management decisions, and serial assessments can reclassify cases as motility worsens or remains stable over a short interval [^115Sdyiw] [^114JKDEk] [^111YCYL5].

> Next, I should review diagnostic evaluation principles and avoid overtesting when a syndromic cause is evident. Clinically, the diagnostic threshold is met with two or more regions of congenital contractures; a tiered workup targets the suspected neurogenic, myopathic, or central origin, with early genetic testing now central to yield, while electrodiagnostics and muscle biopsy have complementary but limited standalone value and are most informative when genetics and clinical evaluation are unrevealing; importantly, I need to ensure we screen for neural axis pathology such as tethered cord by MRI given its higher-than-expected prevalence in AMC, and I should not overlook urologic sequelae like neurogenic bladder that warrant directed evaluation in symptomatic children; coordinated multidisciplinary clinics streamline this complex care [^115nd5mr] [^111CwKMm] [^1174h73n] [^115GcgC9].

> I will now examine management implications briefly to keep the definition clinically anchored. Early, intensive, family-engaged rehabilitation and orthotic management begin in infancy, with staged orthopedic procedures individualized to goals of function and independence; spine deformity is variably prevalent and may require growth-friendly strategies or fusion depending on age and rigidity, and I should confirm that care pathways remain multidisciplinary across development because function and needs evolve even though the primary contractures are considered non-progressive [^113qfH2u] [^111d42wA] [^116SptQe] [^111LJFGC].

> Let me synthesize the final definition, but I will first double-check that I integrate all the qualifiers correctly. Arthrogryposis, formally arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, is a clinical descriptive term for a heterogeneous group of conditions unified by the presence of multiple congenital joint contractures affecting at least two different body areas, recognizable at birth, with contractures that are generally non-progressive, arising secondary to reduced or absent fetal movement during critical periods of joint development; etiologies span more than 400 genetic disorders and numerous maternal, environmental, and extrinsic factors, and collectively these conditions occur in roughly 1 in 3,000 live births, with broader fetal akinesia–related entities ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 [^113qfH2u] [^115ihGCL] [^111svH14] [^116SptQe].

> Finally, I should confirm key clinical takeaways tied to the definition so the concept is actionable. The diagnostic criterion is at least two regions with congenital contractures, the pathogenesis centers on fetal akinesia, the condition is etiologically heterogeneous and often benefits from early genetic testing to guide prognosis and surveillance, and multidisciplinary, early rehabilitation and goal-directed orthopedics are essential to optimize function while monitoring for associated neural axis and urologic comorbidities; I should underscore again that describing the contractures as non-progressive does not imply a static clinical course, and management must anticipate developmental change over time [^115nd5mr] [^115GcgC9] [^113qfH2u].

Arthrogryposis means **multiple congenital joint contractures** [^115ihGCL] present at birth [^114JLYpB], typically involving two or more joints, due to reduced fetal movement [^111svH14] from diverse genetic, neuromuscular, or environmental causes [^113qfH2u]. It is a **non-progressive condition** [^114JLYpB] with a prevalence of about 1 in 3,000–5,000 live births [^115ihGCL], and management focuses on early, multidisciplinary care to maximize function and independence [^115GcgC9].

---

## Definition and clinical features

Arthrogryposis is defined by multiple congenital joint contractures in at least two body areas [^114JLYpB], present at birth [^115ihGCL] [^113qfH2u]. Clinical features include **stiff, immobile joints**, muscle weakness or atrophy, and limited range of motion, commonly affecting the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles [^113sTrHe]. The condition is generally **non-progressive** — the contractures do not worsen over time — though secondary complications may arise without appropriate management [^114JLYpB].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Genetic factors**: Mutations in genes involved in muscle development, neuromuscular junction function, and connective tissue formation have been identified [^1157JFYM]. Examples include mutations in LGI4 [^111a8sNi], ZC4H2 [^1166rcB6], and SCYL2 genes [^114kBwVU].

- **Neuromuscular factors**: Conditions affecting the central or peripheral nervous system [^112qYg8b], such as spinal muscular atrophy or peripheral neuropathies [^115nd5mr], can lead to reduced fetal movement and subsequent joint contractures.

- **Environmental factors**: Maternal infections (e.g. Zika virus [^113HB1J7] [^115kft58]), uterine abnormalities, oligohydramnios, and maternal illnesses (e.g. myasthenia gravis) can restrict fetal movement, resulting in arthrogryposis [^113qfH2u].

The shared pathogenic mechanism is **reduced fetal movement (fetal akinesia)** [^111svH14], leading to abnormal joint development, muscle atrophy, and connective tissue fibrosis.

## Classification

| **Classification** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Amyoplasia | Most common type, characterized by symmetrical limb involvement, muscle hypoplasia, and replacement of muscle tissue with fibrous tissue [^114JLYpB] |
| Distal arthrogryposis | Primarily affects hands and feet, often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern [^111fjuLi] [^112PfHJe] |
| Syndromic arthrogryposis | Associated with other systemic abnormalities, such as neurological or craniofacial anomalies [^114JLYpB] [^115ihGCL] |

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical evaluation**: Physical examination reveals multiple joint contractures, muscle weakness, and limited range of motion [^113sTrHe].

- **Imaging studies**: Prenatal ultrasound can detect reduced fetal movement and joint contractures [^115Sdyiw]. Postnatal imaging (X-rays, MRI) assesses joint and muscle involvement [^113sTrHe].

- **Genetic testing**: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted gene panels identify underlying genetic mutations in approximately 50% of cases [^1157JFYM] [^112Sb4FL].

---

## Treatment and management

- **Physical therapy**: Early and aggressive physical therapy is essential to improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and functional independence [^113sTrHe].

- **Orthopedic interventions**: Surgical procedures, such as soft tissue releases, osteotomies, and joint reconstructions, are performed to correct deformities and improve function [^113sTrHe] [^113R2wPP] [^114u7RQM].

- **Assistive devices**: Orthotic devices, wheelchairs, and adaptive equipment support mobility and daily activities [^116SptQe].

- **Genetic counseling**: Provides information on recurrence risks and family planning options [^1149Xsrb].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the severity of joint involvement, underlying etiology, and access to care. With appropriate management, many individuals achieve **functional independence** [^112Xfc6d] and improved quality of life [^1172Nt1y].

---

Arthrogryposis is a condition characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures, resulting from reduced fetal movement due to genetic, neuromuscular, or environmental factors [^115ihGCL]. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management [^115GcgC9] are essential for improving **functional outcomes** and **quality of life**.

### Genetics and classifications [^114JLYpB]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a descriptive term for a group of conditions characterized by congenital contractures. There are an estimated 400 discrete diagnoses that can lead to a child being born with arthrogryposis. The two biggest categories of conditions are amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis, which combined make up approximately 50% to 65% of all diagnoses within the AMC subset.

Amyoplasia, the most common AMC condition, appears to be a non-genetic syndrome, resulting in very characteristic upper and lower limb contractures. In contrast, distal arthrogryposes have an underlying genetic abnormality that often targets the fast-twitch muscles of the developing fetus. Classifying AMC is a challenging task, given the broad range of conditions it encompasses. Four different classification schemes are presented.

### Arthrogryposis in infancy, multidisciplinary approach: Case report [^113qfH2u]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is an etiopathogenetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by non-progressive multiple intra-articular contractures, which can be recognized at birth. The frequency is estimated at 1 in 3,000 newborns. The etiopathogenesis of arthrogryposis is multifactorial.

Symptoms of some forms of arthrogryposis can be found in selected monogenic diseases with autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked inheritance, chromosomal aberrations, and syndromes of multi-organ congenital malformations.

Arthrogryposis can also result from environmental factors affecting the mother and the fetus, such as infections, medications, traumas, chronic illnesses, oligohydramnios, or abnormal structure of the uterus. These factors, however, lead not only to arthrogryposis but underlie about 7% of all congenital malformations. In the last months of pregnancy, the reduction of fetal movements is a common denominator of these cases. Movement is essential for the normal development of joints and the periarticular tissues. Lack or limitation of movements leads to excessive development of the periarticular connective tissue. Contractures secondary to fetal akinesia are usually more severe in infants diagnosed in early pregnancy.

Few reports can be found in the literature on rehabilitation programs for infants with AMC. Pediatricians are usually the primary care doctors for children with AMC. Later, often at the time the children start to walk, they are referred to orthopedists.

This study presents a multidisciplinary approach to managing AMC.

### Diagnostic value of electromyography and muscle biopsy in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^115nd5mr]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures, is frequently caused by lesions in the peripheral nervous system. Two standard tests for the evaluation of the motor unit are nerve conduction studies/electromyography (NCS/EMG) and muscle biopsy. We reviewed the diagnostic value of these two studies in the evaluation of AMC over a 23-year period, analyzing 38 patients with AMC who had NCS/EMG, muscle biopsy, or both. Final diagnoses were classified as neurogenic (8 patients), myopathic (10 patients), "other" (12 patients), or unknown (8 patients).

Neither test alone had consistently high sensitivities, positive predictive values, or specificities. However, when NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy were concordant for neurogenic or myopathic findings, they were more accurate than either test alone, especially for neurogenic diseases. Test results were most commonly discordant in patients with "other" or unknown diagnoses. These findings suggest that when the clinical evaluation indicates a specific syndromic, developmental, or exogenous cause, NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy are not helpful and may not need to be performed. When the history, examination, and genetic evaluation are unrevealing, NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy together provide valuable diagnostic information.

### Long-term survival in a child with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and spinal muscular atrophy [^1173oqYH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 is a severe form of spinal muscular atrophy that is usually fatal in the first months of life. These children present with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and respiratory compromise. We describe a child with spinal muscular atrophy and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita who has had a much better course and is alive without ventilator support at age 6 years. This case illustrates that the prognosis for spinal muscular atrophy and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita cannot always be predicted with certainty.

### Variants inunderlie distal arthrogryposis accompanied by congenital heart defects [^1169rCTr]. HGG Advances (2023). High credibility.

Pathogenic variants in ACTC1 result in skeletal muscle contractures even though ACTC1 accounts for only ∼5% of total actin in adult skeletal muscle. The most likely explanation is that the skeletal muscle contractures originate during fetal development, when ACTC1 is the predominant source of sarcomeric actin, and replacement of most skeletal muscle actin with wild-type ACTA1 during infancy is insufficient to correct the abnormality. However, it is possible that ACTC1 has a previously unknown function in skeletal muscle biology, or that mutant ACTC1 protein interferes with the function of actin encoded by ACTA1. Testing this hypothesis will require further functional characterization of these variants.

- **MD simulations limitations**: The simulations are limited by several factors. First and foremost, the method used to introduce the pathogenic variants assumes that the mutant constructs can access WT-like conformations, and the timescale along which they transition from a WT-like ensemble to a mutant ensemble is not known. Second, the simulations have probed isolated states of g-actin and F-actin and cannot directly describe effects the variants have on interactions between g-actin and its binding partners nor between F-actin and the rest of the contractile machinery present in sarcomeres. Nevertheless, these simulations provide predictions about the functional consequences of DA-associated variants in ACTC1, generate hypotheses on disease mechanisms, and provide guidance for future studies, such as investigation of whether the variants result in impaired filament assembly or impaired filament mechanics.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^111YCYL5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

- **Advanced ultrasound examination and motor assessment**: The distribution of the phenotypes BPEV, FADS, and AMC are presented per examination, together with the changes over time (see Figure 1). The first step, based on the structural AUE, involves observation of the contractures (44 BPEV, one BPEV together with hip or knee, 15 in upper and lower limbs, four in wrist and elbows/shoulders, two in wrists), flattening of the facial profile (n = 9), polyhydramnios (n = 2), fetal hydrops (n = 3), and increased CT ratio (n = 2). FADS was suspected in 13 of 66 cases, AMC in 12 of 66, BPEV in 40 of 66, and Holt-Oram Syndrome in one of 66. The latter was confirmed genetically and is not included in Figure 1.

	- Figure 1 illustrates the suspected diagnosis based on the advanced ultrasound examination and changes in diagnosis based on the motor assessments, with decisions on termination or continuation of the pregnancy. AMC, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita; FADS, fetal akinesia deformation sequence; BPEV, bilateral pes equinovarus; TOP, termination of pregnancy; IUFD, intrauterine fetal death.

	- The second structural AUE demonstrated progression in contractures twice: one from contractures in wrist, elbow/shoulder, and one from BPEV and knee/hip to contractures in upper and lower limbs. The AUE of the fetus is provided in Table A1.

- **Motor assessment**: At the first motor assessment, nine of 66 showed reduced differentiation, 18 of 66 reduced quality, and nine of 66 reduced quantity. The second motor assessment showed reduced differentiation in seven of 43, reduced quality in eight of 43, and reduced differentiation.

### Rehabilitation needs of youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: Perspectives from key stakeholders [^116SptQe]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a term used to describe congenital contractures in at least two body parts with an overall prevalence of 1 in 3000 live births. It is often caused by lack of fetal movement in utero and presents as contractures of varying severity, which may affect the upper and lower extremities, the spine, and jaw. Currently, no practice recommendations exist to inform best clinical practice for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.

- **Purpose**: To identify the needs surrounding rehabilitation as experienced by youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, caregivers, and clinicians and to propose solutions to develop family- and client-centered rehabilitation recommendations.

- **Materials and methods**: A modified experience-based co-design methodology was used where qualitative interviews were conducted with key stakeholders.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven participants completed the interviews, and demographic information was collected. Early-active rehabilitation began at birth in most cases and became less frequent through adolescence. Three overarching themes were determined for each stakeholder group. All participants reported that early-active rehabilitation is beneficial as it helps determine future treatments. Transition times and participation need to be at the center of interventions to ensure that the needs of youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are being met. The development of a condition-specific outcome measure and rehabilitation practice recommendations will assist clinicians in addressing the needs of youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.

### Treatment of knee flexion contractures in patients with arthrogryposis [^113R2wPP]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Knee flexion contractures in children with arthrogryposis are difficult to treat. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of posterior knee releases and gradual contracture distraction with an Ilizarov external fixator in correcting and maintaining correction of knee flexion contractures of 40 degrees or greater.

- **Methods**: The medical records and radiographs of 7 consecutive pediatric patients (10 knees) with arthrogryposis and knee flexion contractures of 40 degrees or greater were reviewed. The mean age at surgery was 7.3 years, and the mean length of follow-up was 52.7 months. All patients' knee flexion contractures were treated with posterior soft tissue releases and an Ilizarov external fixator for gradual contracture distraction. Posterior soft tissue releases included hamstrings lengthenings, proximal gastrocnemius release, and release of the posterior capsule.

- **Results**: The mean total fixator time was 102 days, with a mean correction rate of 1 degree per day. The mean knee flexion contracture was 72.5 degrees preoperatively, and all knees were corrected to full extension, ± 5 degrees. At the latest follow-up, the mean contracture was 20.5 degrees, and all knees were ligamentously stable. The mean total arc of motion was 56 degrees preoperatively and 54 degrees at follow-up. Five patients who were previously nonambulatory became ambulatory. Complications included 3 fractures, 2 posterior tibial subluxations requiring frame adjustment, and 3 contracture recurrences (1 in a patient with a popliteal pterygium).

- **Conclusions**: Posterior knee release remains an important surgical strategy in managing knee flexion contractures in this patient population.

### Background to the 2nd international symposium on arthrogryposis [^1147tcxS]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital is a relatively uncommon condition, with little consensus on treatment. In 2007, the 1st International Symposium on Arthrogryposis was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, to bring together patients, their families, and a multinational group of health care experts in the field of arthrogryposis to discuss various aspects of the care of patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenital. From that meeting, there was a coalescence of thought on diagnosis and classification, a sharing of practices on treatments and their outcomes, and an agreement on future directions. At the beginning of the 2nd International Symposium on Arthrogryposis held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in September 2014, these "lessons learnt" were synopsized to set the tone for the new meeting.

### Arthrogryposis in infancy, multidisciplinary approach: Case report [^111d42wA]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is an etiopathogenetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by non-progressive multiple intra-articular contractures, which can be recognized at birth. The frequency is estimated at 1 in 3,000 newborns. The etiopathogenesis of arthrogryposis is multifactorial.

- **Case presentation**: We report the first 26 weeks of life of a boy with severe arthrogryposis. Owing to the integrated rehabilitation approach and orthopedic treatment, a visible improvement in the range of motion as well as the functionality of the child was achieved. This article proposes a cooperation of various specialists: pediatrician, orthopedist, specialist of medical rehabilitation, and physiotherapist.

- **Conclusions**: Rehabilitation of a child with arthrogryposis should be early, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary. Corrective treatment of knee and hip joints in infants with arthrogryposis should be preceded by ultrasound control. There are no reports in the literature on the ultrasound imaging techniques that can be used prior to the planned orthopedic and rehabilitative treatment in infants with arthrogryposis. The experience of our team indicates that such an approach allows for the minimization of diagnostic errors and maintains effective treatment without the risk of joint destabilization.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^114YR53x]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study population**: A total of 260 ultrasound recordings matched the search, containing 140 fetuses from 128 women. Of the 140 cases, 74 were excluded because they did not meet the criteria. The prenatal diagnosis of these 74 fetuses, together with their outcome, are presented in Table 2. In 16 of the 74 cases, no motor assessment had been performed, no other anomalies were suspected, and one developed fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), resulting in a stillborn boy delivered at 30 weeks. During the same period, another fetus suspected of FADS was noted at 35 weeks. However, this fetus did not fulfill the inclusion criteria of the present study, as no contractures were observed at the 20-week structural anomaly scan. The case was referred to our hospital at 35 weeks for polyhydramnios, limited stomach filling, and reduced motility. The mother had experienced reduced fetal movements from 24 weeks onwards. Motor assessment at 35 weeks was suspect for FADS. At 35 weeks and 3 days, a stillborn boy was born. FADS was confirmed at post‐mortem examination.

The final study population consisted of 66 fetuses from 65 women (median age 32.2 years; range 21.1–43.8 years). Consanguinity was present in four couples (three affected by BPEV and one by FADS), absent in 50, and unknown in 11. The mean gestational age at the first assessment was 20 weeks, while the mean gestational age at the second assessment was 22 weeks and 1 day.

### Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants cause severe fetal akinesia with arthrogryposis multiplex [^111svH14]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Fetal akinesia (FA) comprises a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by absent or reduced fetal movements, resulting in a variety of secondary deformations. The associated clinical presentations range in severity, from distal arthrogryposis, multiple pterygium syndrome, and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) to severe FA deformation sequence (FADS) or lethal congenital contracture syndrome. Observed clinical features might overlap between these entities and depend on the degree and time point of the movement impairment during pregnancy. Consistent findings include joint contractures, reduced skeletal muscle mass, subcutaneous edema, fetal hydrops, pulmonary hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. Additional organ systems might be involved as part of a broad syndromic spectrum associated with the primary cause of FA. While many of these conditions are recognized in utero, others are not detected until birth.

The causes of FA are diverse and include maternal or environmental causes, as well as a rapidly growing number of genetic factors, with at least 166 distinct loci being firmly associated with FA at the time of writing. Although individually rare, they collectively account for an incidence of multiple joint contractures in 1/2000–1/5000 live births.

Significant progress has been made over the last years to define the set of genes involved and substantially improve the diagnostic yield. However, despite the wide availability of exome sequencing even in a prenatal routine diagnostic setting, a relevant portion of affected individuals remain undiagnosed.

### Common data elements for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: An international framework [^111enD43]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

To facilitate multisite studies and international clinical research, this study aimed to identify consensus-based, standardized common data elements (CDEs) for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC).

A mixed-methods study comprising several focus group discussions and three rounds of modified Delphi surveys to achieve consensus using two tiered-rating scales was conducted.

Overall, 45 clinical experts and adults with lived experience, including 12 members of an AMC consortium, participated in this study from 11 countries in North America, Europe, and Australia. The CDEs include 321 data elements and 19 standardized measures across various domains from fetal development to adulthood. Data elements pertaining to AMC phenotypic traits were mapped according to the Human Phenotype Ontology. A universal governance structure, local operating protocols, and sustainability plans were identified as the main facilitators, whereas limited capacity for data sharing and the need for a federated informatics infrastructure were the main barriers.

Collection of systematic data on AMC using CDEs will allow investigations on etiological pathways, describe the epidemiological profile, and establish genotype-phenotype correlations in a standardized manner. The proposed CDEs will facilitate international multidisciplinary collaborations by improving large-scale studies and opportunities for data sharing, knowledge translation, and dissemination.

### Growth charts for children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^1122qG7P]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) often demonstrate growth differences compared with typically developing (TD) children. However, growth charts have not been developed for this population. The purpose of this study was to create AMC-specific growth charts and compare these values to those of TD children. A retrospective review of height/length and weight for 206 children with AMC was performed. Growth charts were developed and stratified over seven percentiles; these were then compared with growth charts of TD children.

Children with AMC tend to be smaller in stature and weight compared with TD children, particularly in the first 36 months of life. Thereafter, weight values trend toward the 50th percentile of TD children, but height/length values persist around the 5th percentile of TD children. The development of AMC-specific growth charts provides health care providers an objective tool to evaluate growth patterns of patients with AMC.

### Variants inunderlie distal arthrogryposis accompanied by congenital heart defects [^112PfHJe]. HGG Advances (2023). High credibility.

Contraction of the human sarcomere is the result of interactions between myosin cross-bridges and actin filaments. Pathogenic variants in genes such as MYH7, TPM1, and TNNI3, which encode parts of the cardiac sarcomere, cause muscle diseases that affect the heart, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

In contrast, pathogenic variants in homologous genes such as MYH2, TPM2, and TNNI2, which encode parts of the skeletal muscle sarcomere, cause muscle diseases affecting skeletal muscle, such as distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes and skeletal myopathies. At the time of writing, there have been few reports of genes (e.g. MYH7) encoding sarcomeric proteins in which the same pathogenic variant affects both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Moreover, none of the known genes underlying DA have been found to contain pathogenic variants that also cause cardiac abnormalities.

We report five families with DA due to heterozygous missense variants in the gene actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1). ACTC1 encodes a highly conserved actin that binds to myosin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Pathogenic variants in ACTC1 have previously been found to underlie atrial septal defect, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular noncompaction. Our discovery delineates a new DA condition due to variants in ACTC1 and suggests that some functions of ACTC1 are shared in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

### Association between arthrogryposis and mortality in infants with congenital Zika syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113HB1J7]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Intrauterine Zika virus infection is associated with neurological disorders and other problems, such as impaired visual and hearing function, and orthopedic abnormalities, including arthrogryposis. We systematically investigated the prevalence of arthrogryposis in infants with congenital Zika syndrome and the respective risk of mortality.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports published in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and World Health Organization Global Index Medicus databases, using the keywords Zika virus and arthrogryposis and related terms.

- **Results**: After screening titles and abstracts, a total of four studies were included. Arthrogryposis was not associated with an increased risk for fetal demise (risk ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 15.26). However, arthrogryposis was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of mortality in neonates with congenital Zika syndrome (risk ratio, 13.11; 95% confidence interval, 3.74 to 45.92) than neonates with congenital Zika syndrome but without arthrogryposis.

- **Conclusions**: Neonates with both congenital Zika syndrome and arthrogryposis had higher morbidity and mortality risks, necessitating the implementation of protocols for the early identification of neuromuscular changes and appropriate management of patients.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^1157P1WN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

This retrospective study explores the additional value of motor assessment to AUE in distinguishing between stable AMC or BPEV and the deterioration of AMC into FADS. The results suggest that the expectation that motor assessment has additional value in distinguishing between FADS and AMC/BPEV is plausible. A multidisciplinary approach during and after pregnancy is recommended to enhance counseling, follow-up treatment, and the identification of underlying diseases.

### Multidisciplinary clinics [^115GcgC9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

More than 400 acquired and genetic diseases are labeled as arthrogryposis. Because of their rarity and complexity, coordinated patient management is often lacking. Multidisciplinary clinics are the ideal setting to provide coordinated and comprehensive care to patients with special needs. Two similar experiences of multidisciplinary clinics for the care of patients with arthrogryposis were reported at the Symposium on Arthrogryposis held in Saint Petersburg in September 2014. These clinics are organized to bring together professionals from several disciplines with the aim to provide patient-centered, comprehensive clinical care and reduce the burden of multiple medical appointments for the families.

### Congenital Zika syndrome with arthrogryposis: Retrospective case series study [^115kft58]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test for Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid samples of two children, following the CDC protocol.

Microcephaly is an important sign; however, it is not present in all cases of congenital Zika virus infection. The Fetal International and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century (Intergrowth-21st) defines microcephaly as a head circumference two standard deviations below the mean for gestational age and sex, and severe microcephaly as three standard deviations below this mean. We also used the Intergrowth-21st curve to evaluate birth weight, classifying it as appropriate, small, or large for gestational age and sex.

All the children underwent neurological and orthopedic examinations along with several other investigations: radiography; brain computed tomography (CT) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast; high definition ultrasonography of the joints, with specific attention to cartilage, synovia, pericapsular structures, and muscular tissue around joints; nerve conduction studies; and needle electromyography. If calcifications were present on brain imaging (CT or MRI), we considered the possibility of congenital infections.

Four children underwent MRI of the spine. MRI was not possible in two children as they were receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit.

According to Pernambuco state's protocol for microcephaly, all seven children underwent fundoscopic assessment, and six also underwent hearing screening by otoacoustic emissions or brainstem evoked potentials.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^114JKDEk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). High credibility.

In two cases, three motor assessments could be performed before 24 weeks gestational age; the results of the third examination were in line with the second motor assessment and did not change the diagnoses.

Late referral gave no time before 24 weeks for repeated motor assessment after 2 weeks in 10 cases. Because of a reassuring first assessment and no other signs of FADS, the pregnancies were continued. None in this group developed FADS, and BPEV was confirmed in all after birth.

One TOP was performed in a fetus with BPEV after the first structural and motor assessment; motor assessment demonstrated normal motility. The diagnosis of BPEV was confirmed by autopsy after TOP.

The pregnancy outcome was available for all fetuses, and the prenatal diagnosis of FADS, AMC, and BPEV or other contractures at the latest examination were confirmed by postnatal examination in all fetuses. In four cases, an underlying diagnosis was found in addition to BPEV: spinal muscular atrophy, Down's syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, and lissencephaly.

- **Detailed description**: The phenotype suspected prenatally, decision concerning the pregnancy, diagnosis postnatally, the investigation, and consultations after birth are depicted for all the cases in Table 3.

- **Genetic examination**: In six of 18 FADS cases, genetic examination showed an underlying cause, including MUSK mutation, SCN4A mutation (n = 2), RyR1 mutation (n = 2), and diastrophic dysplasia. In three of seven fetuses with AMC, an underlying genetic cause was found, which included nemaline myopathy, a TGFBR1 gene mutation, and a PIEZO2 gene mutation.

Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) occurred.

- **Modes of inheritance**: Based on disease gene identification, the percentage indicates the ratio of patients carrying pathogenic variants with a given mode of inheritance to 166, the total number of index patients with an identified disease gene.

We then compared the number of AMC families in whom the gene was either identified or not, depending on whether the AMC was familial or sporadic, and in sporadic patients born to consanguineous parents or not (figures 2 and 6). There was a highly statistically significant difference in gene identification in familial AMC (66 out of 89, 74%) when compared with sporadic AMC (100 out of 226, 44%). In sporadic AMC, there was also a statistically significant difference in gene identification in patients born to consanguineous parents (29 out of 45, 64%) when compared with those born to non-consanguineous parents (60 out of 151, 40%).

### Ambulatory activity in youth with arthrogryposis: a cohort study [^116846pK]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis is characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures that affect ambulation. This study compared the ambulatory activity of subjects with the two most common forms of arthrogryposis and a control group of typically developing youth.

- **Methods**: This is a cross-sectional, cohort study. Thirteen ambulatory subjects with amyoplasia or distal arthrogryposis and 13 age- and sex-matched controls wore the StepWatch3 Activity Monitor on their ankles for 7 days. The daily frequency, duration, and intensity of ambulatory activity were measured. The parents of the subjects also completed Activities Scale for Kids, Performance-38 questionnaires to compare parent-reported activity levels with StepWatch3 Activity Monitor measurements.

- **Results**: The mean ages of the subject and control groups were 10.83 and 10.95 years, respectively, with 8 males and 5 females in each group. Subjects, as compared with controls, took significantly fewer steps, 5668 ± 1134 versus 7685 ± 1164, respectively (P = 0.02), and spent significantly less of their active time at high step rates, 8% versus 13% (P = 0.05). The average Activities Scale for Kids, Performance summary scores for subjects (76.8 ± 18.9) were significantly lower than controls (90.6 ± 7.2) (P = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: We have been able to quantify the activity levels of children with amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis relative to that of age- and sex-matched typically developing youth. Youth with arthrogryposis took significantly fewer steps, spent less time at high activity levels, and had significantly lower parental report o

### Functional independence of children with arthrogryposis [^112Xfc6d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis (AMC) is a descriptive term used to characterize a child born with multiple joint contractures. Treatment aims to improve functional independence, yet the literature objectively describing functional independence in this population is scarce. This study aimed to describe the functional independence of children with AMC through the lens of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) and observational activities of daily living (ADL) tasks.

- **Methods**: Patients with AMC between the ages of 3 and 12 years participated in this prospective study. Parents completed the PEDI-CAT while a trained occupational therapist observed children as they completed a checklist of functional ADL tasks. Patients were grouped according to developmental age groups: "preschoolers" (3 to 5 years), "early school-age" (6 to 9 years), and "late school-age" (10 to 12 years). Patient's PEDI-CAT normative scores were described, comparing the study population to typically developing children, and differences in each domain were examined between developmental age groups. The observed ADL tasks completed were also described, and differences in scores were examined between developmental age groups.

- **Results**: Forty-four patients (mean age of 7 ± 2.86 years) were enrolled. The distribution between age groups was nearly even. Mean daily activities T-score for patients with AMC was 25.80 ± 11.98, and the mean mobility T-score was 17.39 ± 9.77. Late school-age children scored significantly lower than preschool-age children in both of these domains (P < 0.01).

### Genetics of arthrogryposis: Linkage analysis approach [^114wBq8k]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a heterogeneous group of congenital contracture syndromes, some of which are hereditary. At the time of writing, four genetic loci associated with autosomal recessive arthrogryposis syndromes have been identified using the powerful tools of genome-wide linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping. In the consanguineous inbred Bedouin population in southern Israel, there is an unusually high incidence of hereditary arthrogryposis. We hypothesized the high incidence of this phenotype in this specific cohort might be due to a founder effect: a mutation that occurred several generations ago, spread throughout various tribes in that population in recent generations, and causes the phenotype in its homozygous form. Using linkage analysis studies, we showed the hereditary arthrogryposis in those tribes does not stem from a single genetic defect. Thus, there is genetic heterogeneity of congenital arthrogryposis in this population: the same phenotype is caused by mutations in different genes, yet to be unraveled.

### Congenital Zika syndrome with arthrogryposis: retrospective case series study [^1149NWUY]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to describe the clinical, radiological, and electromyographic features in a series of children with joint contractures (arthrogryposis) associated with congenital infection presumably caused by the Zika virus.

- **Design**: Retrospective case series study.

- **Setting**: Association for Assistance of Disabled Children, Pernambuco state, Brazil.

- **Participants**: Seven children with arthrogryposis and a diagnosis of congenital infection presumably caused by the Zika virus during the Brazilian microcephaly epidemic.

- **Main outcome measures**: Main clinical, radiological, and electromyographic findings, and likely correlation between clinical and primary neurological abnormalities.

- **Results**: The brain images of all seven children were characteristic of congenital infection and arthrogryposis. Two children tested positive for IgM to Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid. Arthrogryposis was present in the arms and legs of six children (86%) and the legs of one child (14%). Hip radiographs showed bilateral dislocation in seven children, subluxation of the knee associated with genu valgus in three children (43%), which was bilateral in two (29%). All the children underwent high-definition ultrasonography of the joints, and there was no evidence of abnormalities. Moderate signs of remodeling of the motor units and a reduced recruitment pattern were found on needle electromyography (monopolar). Five of the children underwent brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the remaining two CT only. All presented malformations of cortical development and calcifications.

The benefits of an accurate genetic diagnosis include a better understanding of prognosis, more tailored management of AMC, and possibly other organ involvement, as well as improved surveillance. A precise genetic diagnosis of AMC enables accurate genetic advice to the affected individuals and their families. This may provide them with increased reproductive choices, for example, by enabling preimplantation diagnosis, non-invasive prenatal testing, or prenatal diagnosis.

### Arthrogryposis in infancy, multidisciplinary approach: Case report [^1132ASJj]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Early rehabilitation of a child with arthrogryposis requires the involvement of parents or guardians. Unfortunately, in the face of serious illness, a relationship crisis may occur between the parents, often leading to the disintegration of the relationship. Parents of a child burdened with a severe congenital disease often experience disappointment, frustration, and a loss of control. The care for a sick child usually necessitates changes in everyday life and long-term plans, which may result in depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder.

### Distal humerus external rotation osteotomy for hand position in arthrogryposis [^113D8g59]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In the amyoplasia type of arthrogryposis, a reverse pronated grasp pattern is often seen. We hypothesized that repositioning the hands through distal humerus external rotation osteotomies (DHO) would allow for palm-to-palm grasp without arm cross-over and would improve function and parent/patient satisfaction.

- **Methods**: The medical records of all patients treated surgically for arthrogryposis were reviewed at the Shriners Hospital for Children, St. Louis, MO. From 2012 to 2014, nine patients (14 extremities) had undergone a DHO. All patients had preoperative and postoperative video recordings of functional activities, and we assessed functional changes after osteotomies. Preoperative upper extremity position was graded as 1, palms facing midline; 2, palm facing posterior; and 3, palms facing away from midline. Postoperative Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) questionnaires were obtained, and parent satisfaction was evaluated.

- **Results**: The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 6.5 years. Five patients underwent bilateral DHOs. All patients had three or fewer additional procedures on an upper extremity during the study period. All patients had an improved resting posture of the upper extremity after DHO surgery, with a mean change of 51° (range, 15°-90°). Grasp pattern was altered in 13 extremities; there was a change in hand position of at least one grade. Additionally, five patients experienced a complete change from grade 3 to grade 1, with palms facing away from midline to facing toward midline. There was a wide range in postoperative PODCI scores for function, but Happiness scores were high, with a mean score of 8.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^113gLvTc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Women who underwent an AUE for multiple contractures in the tertiary hospital VU University Medical Centre during the period from 2007 to 2016 were extracted from the digitalized ultrasound database, ASTRAIA Software GmbH. The database was searched for the following terms: contracture(s), FADS, Pena‐Shokeir (prior nomenclature of FADS), limb deformity, AMC, and hypokinesia. The inclusion criteria were more than one contracture at the 20‐week standard anomaly scan and/or AUE and availability of a motor assessment. Data were stored in an anonymized digital database containing the results of the AUE, the postural and motor assessment together with the outcome measures, and if known, the underlying disease. Approval of the local research ethics committee was obtained from the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. Ethical approval has been waived by the ethics committee of the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc since it is a retrospective study without patient identifiers.

- **Definitions of FADS, AMC, and bilateral clubfeet**: At the first and second structural assessment, bilateral pes equinovares (BPEV) was defined as bilateral clubfeet without contractures in other regions or structural abnormalities related to FADS, e.g. polyhydramnios, IUGR, flattened face profile, and/or increased cardiothoracic ratio. AMC was defined as multiple contractures in more than one region, e.g. arms and legs, without other structural abnormalities related to FADS. FADS was defined as contractures in combination with other structural abnormalities.

### Arthrogryposis and amyoplasia [^113sTrHe]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis, which involves multiple congenital joint contractures, is an uncommon condition. Given the variety of potential causes, correct diagnosis is crucial for predicting the natural history and determining appropriate treatment. Inconsistent terminology has led to confusion regarding both diagnosis and treatment. Amyoplasia, the most prevalent form of arthrogryposis, is characterized by quadrimelic involvement and the replacement of skeletal muscle with dense fibrous tissue and fat. Early intervention with physical therapy and splinting may improve contractures; however, surgical intervention is often necessary. Aggressive soft-tissue releases, coupled with casting, may enhance joint position. In cases of more severe contractures, osseous surgery may also be required. Deformity recurrence is common, especially in skeletally immature patients.

### Fetal akinesia deformation sequence, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and bilateral clubfeet: Is motor assessment of additional value for in utero diagnosis? A 10-year cohort study [^115Sdyiw]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a challenge. Motor assessment is of additional value to advanced ultrasound examinations (AUE) for in utero FADS diagnosis before 24 weeks of gestation.

- **Methods**: All consecutive fetuses with greater than or equal to two contractures on the 20-week structural anomaly scan (2007–2016) were included. Findings at AUE, including motor assessment, were analyzed and related to outcome.

- **Results**: Sixty-six fetuses fulfilled the inclusion criteria. On the basis of the first AUE, FADS was suspected in 13 of 66 fetuses, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) in 12 of 66, bilateral pes equinovares (BPEV) in 40 of 66, and Holt-Oram syndrome in one of 66. On the basis of the first motor assessment, the suspected diagnosis changed in 19 of 66 cases: in 13 of 66 worsening to FADS, six of 66 amelioration from FADS, and FADS was confirmed in seven of 13. The result was 20 FADS, seven AMC, and 38 BPEV. Second AUE in 44 fetuses showed additional contractures in two of eight FADS, and one intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). The second motor assessment changed the diagnosis in three of 43 cases: one worsening from BPEV into FADS, two ameliorations from FADS, and confirmed FADS in seven by deterioration of motility. The result was nine FADS, six AMC, and 29 BPEV.

- **Conclusion**: The results suggest that motor assessment has additional value to distinguish between FADS, AMC, and BPEV.

### X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy: Clinical definition and molecular mapping [^112qYg8b]. Genetics in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

X-linked infantile spinal-muscular atrophy (XL-SMA) is a rare disorder characterized by hypotonia, areflexia, and multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis). It is associated with the loss of anterior horn cells and typically results in death in infancy. Previously, we reported a single family with XL-SMA that mapped to Xp11.3-q11.2. In this study, we further describe the clinical characteristics of XL-SMA, including data from seven additional unrelated families from North America and Europe. These families demonstrate linkage data consistent with the same region.

- **Methods**: We investigated linkage to the candidate disease gene region using microsatellite repeat markers. To refine the critical region, we saturated the candidate gene area with polymorphic microsatellite repeat markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two-point and multipoint linkage analyses were conducted using the Allegro software package.

- **Results**: Linkage analysis of all the XL-SMA families exhibited linkage consistent with the original XL-SMA region.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of new families and markers has refined the disease gene interval for the XL-SMA locus between SNP FLJ22843 near marker DXS8080 and SNP ARHGEF9 near DXS7132 (Xp11.3-Xq11.1).

### Congenital Zika syndrome with arthrogryposis: Retrospective case series study [^113gyZJr]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 1 presents various contractures: (A) contracture in flexion of the knee; (B) hyperextension of the knee (knee dislocation); (C) clubfeet; (D) deformities in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers; (E) joint contractures in legs and arms, without trunk involvement. None of the children exhibited deformities or limitations of motion in the cervical spine.

Other findings included ligamentous laxity in one child (14%) and skin haemangiomas in four children (57%), with one frontal, three occipital, and one on the left parathoracic region.

Hip radiographs indicated bilateral dislocation in seven children and subluxation of the knee associated with genu valgus in three children (43%), bilateral in two (29%). In all children, no dysplastic changes were identified on simple radiographs of the appendicular skeleton and spine, in either the sagittal or coronal plane. Dysplastic changes were identified in the dislocated hips, related to dysplastic acetabular development (acetabular index > 30 degrees). The main orthopaedic abnormalities are illustrated in Table 2.

Figure 2 details radiological features: (A) magnetic resonance imaging displaying bilateral hip dislocation, epiphyseal core (small arrow), and dysplastic acetabulum (large arrow); (B) 3D computed tomogram revealing bilateral hip dislocation; (C) anteroposterior radiographs showing features compatible with hip dislocation, including the interruption of Shenton's arc, hypoplastic proximal femoral epiphysis, acetabular index of 35 degrees, and position of the right and left proximal femoral epiphysis in the lateral side and bottom quadrant.

### Does open reduction of arthrogrypotic hips cause stiffness [^117Mf1mi]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Low credibility.

Concerns of potential hip stiffness following open reduction for congenitally dislocated hips in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (arthrogryposis) persist, despite published accounts of positive outcomes. We retrospectively compared preoperative and postoperative hip motion and evaluated the ambulatory abilities of patients who underwent the procedure.

- **Methods**: Over a 10-year period, 52 patients with arthrogryposis underwent 75 open reductions for congenitally dislocated hips with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The mean age at surgery was 23 months. Hip range of motion data was recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the last follow-up, as was ambulatory ability. Radiographs were assessed for hip station and avascular necrosis.

- **Results**: The average follow-up was 68 months; 59% had femoral shortenings. Preoperatively, 34 hips had a mean flexion contracture of 33 degrees, improving by 22 degrees at follow-up; 59 hips had less than 45 degrees frog-leg abduction and 39 hips had less than 30 degrees abduction preoperatively, improving by 11 and 10 degrees, respectively (all P ≤ 0.001). The flexion-extension total arc of motion decreased by only 1 degree from preoperative to follow-up (P = 0.733). Patients with unilateral dislocation (n = 29) had no significant difference in the total arc of motion between the dislocated and non-dislocated hips at the final follow-up. Hips with less than 90 degrees of flexion preoperatively showed no improvement following reduction. At a mean follow-up of 68 months (24 to 152 months), 31 patients were independently ambulatory, and 15 were walker-dependent.

### A novel sporadic 614-kb duplication of the 22q11.2 chromosome in a child with amyoplasia [^1145WKwx]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple fixed joint contractures. Decreased fetal movement, regardless of etiology, causes an immobilization of the affected joints and subsequent contractures. Amyoplasia refers to the most common variant of arthrogryposis in which patients develop symmetrical limb contractures because of muscle underdevelopment. It is a sporadic condition with no known genetic abnormality linked to this syndrome. The authors report a 4-month-old boy with amyoplasia carrying a novel de novo 614-kb duplication of the 22q11.2 region. Amyoplasia has not been reported in patients with 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome.

This particular 614-kb duplicated segment contains seven genes located within the typical 22q11.2 duplication region and two genes, TUBA8 and USP18, mapping outside of the typical region. This patient broadens the phenotypic spectrum of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome and raises the possibility that TUBA8 and USP18 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of amyoplasia.

### Elbow release and tricepsplasty in arthrogrypotic patients: A long-term follow-up study [^114u7RQM]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Obtaining elbow flexion to improve hand-to-mouth reach capability is an essential component of achieving functional independence in pediatric patients with arthrogryposis. This study analyzed the long-term outcomes of elbow release and tricepsplasty in a series of children with arthrogryposis at a tertiary institution.

- **Methods**: Medical records of patients with arthrogryposis who underwent elbow release and tricepsplasty from 1993 to 2015, with at least 2 years of follow-up, were reviewed. Collected measures included preoperative elbow passive range of motion (ROM), postoperative elbow passive and active ROM, shoulder passive and active ROM, and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) scores. Our analysis compared pre- and postoperative follow-up of elbow passive ROM and reviewed PODCI scores with age-adjusted normative values.

- **Results**: Seventeen patients (4 female and 13 male) with 24 affected upper extremities (10 left elbow and 14 right elbow) were included in final analysis. Age at final follow-up averaged 11 years (range, 4–20 years), mean age at surgery was 2.7 years (range, 9.6 months-9.3 years) with mean follow-up by extremity at 8.3 years (range, 2–18 years). Differences in pre- and post-operative passive elbow ROM were significant for extension, flexion, and total arc of motion. Most parent and self-reported PODCI scores were less than the age-adjusted normal population, except in the domains of Comfort and Pain and Happiness.

- **Conclusion**: Long-term follow-up of elbow release and tricepsplasty in patients with arthrogryposis indicates both significant improvement in mobility and reduction in discomfort.

### Treatment of the upper extremity contracture/deformities [^111qbsBN]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita have a characteristic upper extremity resting posture, consisting of internal rotation of the shoulders, elbow extension, flexed wrists, thumb-in palm deformities, and variable degrees of finger contractures. Treatment for these patients aims to improve independence and performance in activities of daily living. Although each area requires independent assessment to determine the most appropriate surgical procedure, multiple areas can often be addressed in the same operative setting. This strategy limits the number of anesthetic exposures and cast immobilization time. Presented here is a synopsis of treatment strategies discussed at the second international symposium on arthrogryposis, which took place in St. Petersburg in September 2014.

### Treatment of the lower extremity contracture/deformities [^112Mw4hQ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Lower extremity deformities in patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita present a wide spectrum of severity and deformity combinations. Treatment goals range from ensuring comfortable seating and shoe wear to achieving fully independent and active ambulation. The overarching intention is to help realize the patient's greatest potential for independence and function. Treatment of hip and knee contractures and dislocations has become more interventional, whereas treatment of foot deformities has paradoxically become much less surgical. This article synopsizes the treatment strategies presented in September 2014 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, at the second International Symposium on Arthrogryposis.

### Phenotypic spectrum and genomics of undiagnosed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^1157JFYM]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is characterized by congenital joint contractures in two or more body areas. AMC exhibits wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Our goals were to improve the genetic diagnosis rates of AMC, evaluate the added value of whole exome sequencing (WES) compared with targeted exome sequencing (TES), and identify new genes in 315 unrelated undiagnosed AMC families.

- **Methods**: Several genomic approaches were used, including genetic mapping of disease loci in multiplex or consanguineous families, TES, then WES. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify or validate variants.

- **Results**: We achieved disease gene identification in 52.7% of AMC index patients, including nine recently identified genes (CNTNAP1, MAGEL2, ADGRG6, ADCY6, GLDN, LGI4, LMOD3, UNC50, and SCN1A). Moreover, we identified pathogenic variants in ASXL3 and STAC3, expanding the phenotypes associated with these genes. The most frequent cause of AMC was a primary involvement of skeletal muscle (40%), followed by the brain (22%). The most frequent mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (66.3% of patients). In sporadic patients born to non-consanguineous parents (n = 60), de novo dominant autosomal or X-linked variants were observed in 30 of them (50%).

- **Conclusion**: New genes recently identified in AMC represent 21% of causing genes in our cohort. A high proportion of de novo variants were observed, indicating that this mechanism plays a prominent part in this developmental disease. Our data showed the added value of WES compared with TES due to the larger clinical scope it offers.

### Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: A 28-year retrospective study [^114uirwJ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

To identify all patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita presenting to a specialized pediatric orthopedic institution over a 28-year period, the study aimed to classify them into three groups: general arthrogryposis not otherwise specified (NOS), amyoplasia, or distal arthrogryposis. It also aimed to report the frequency of various musculoskeletal features and determine the rate of operative treatment.

Patients with arthrogryposis under the age of 18 years who presented between 1990 and 2017 were included. These patients were placed into one of three groups based on clinical features and family history when available. The study recorded the age of presentation, joint involvement, and utilization of surgical treatment.

The results showed a total of 417 patients (184 females, 233 males). Among these, 235 patients (56.4%) had general arthrogryposis NOS, 107 (25.7%) had amyoplasia, and 75 (18.0%) had distal arthrogryposis. Patients with amyoplasia presented at a younger age (median 4 months) than those with general arthrogryposis NOS (median 1 year 3 months, p = 0.005) and had a lower rate of spine involvement than patients with general arthrogryposis NOS (p = 0.004) and distal arthrogryposis (p = 0.023). The average number of surgeries across all patients was 1.9 (SD 2.2).

Pediatric patients with amyoplasia tend to present to orthopedic care earlier and are less likely to have spine involvement than those with other forms of arthrogryposis. Multiple surgeries are common among all patients with arthrogryposis.

### Phenotypic spectrum and genomics of undiagnosed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^115JCPh8]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Genes in which pathogenic variants were identified in our cohort of AMC index patients are crucial for understanding the complex landscape of this condition. The percentage indicates the ratio of patients with unrelated AMC carrying pathogenic variant(s) in a given gene to 166, the total number of index patients with an identified disease gene. The blue color indicates new genes identified in AMC within the last 6 years. AMC stands for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.

Targeted exome sequencing (TES) of genes known to be frequently involved in AMC, or new candidate genes, was performed in 210 index patients. Initially, the first panel included 67 genes, which then expanded to 84. The genetic cause was identified in only 68 affected individuals (32%), suggesting that other genes responsible for syndromic or non-syndromic AMC were not included in the panels or novel genes not yet recognized as responsible for AMC.

In patients with undiagnosed AMC, the phenotype was re-evaluated based on clinical data or muscle biopsy. This led to further investigations, including CMA, SMN1, MTM1 (MIM: 300415), or NIPBL (MIM: 608667) analysis, allowing the identification of the disease-causing gene defect in four patients. In 27 cases with negative TES results, other investigations, including whole exome sequencing (WES), were not performed due to limited DNA quantity from the index patient. When no predicted pathogenic variants were identified through TES, WES sequencing was performed in 111 index patients. WES allowed the identification of the disease-causing gene in 24 index patients (21.6%). Among the genes identified, some of them were not commonly recognized in association with the condition.

### Anesthetic outcomes of children with arthrogryposis syndromes: No evidence of hyperthermia [^1157qa4F]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures, often requiring multiple surgeries during childhood to address skeletal and visceral abnormalities. Previous reports suggest that these children face increased perioperative risks, including hypermetabolic events distinct from malignant hyperthermia, along with difficult airway management, isolated hyperthermia, and challenging IV line placement. We aimed to compare children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) against those with the less severe distal arthrogryposis syndromes (DAS) to evaluate potential intraoperative hyperthermia in AMC patients. We hypothesized that children with AMC experienced a higher incidence of intraoperative hyperthermia and encountered more challenges with airway management and IV access.

- **Methods**: Children aged 0 to 25 years with arthrogryposis syndromes, who underwent anesthesia from 1972 to 2013, were identified. The medical records were reviewed for demographics, arthrogryposis type, and anesthetic complications. AMC subjects were compared with DAS subjects. To assess the probability of hyperthermia and hypermetabolic responses in AMC patients, we conducted a post hoc case-control analysis. Patients with AMC were matched in a 1:2 ratio to patients without arthrogryposis to evaluate the primary outcome of maximum intraoperative temperature.

- **Results**: Forty-five patients with AMC and 16 patients with DAS underwent 264 and 105 unique anesthetics, respectively. There was no significant difference in intraoperative hyperthermia or hypermetabolic events. [Note: The results section appears to be truncated.]

### Do not forget the spine MRI in children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: High prevalence of tethered spinal cord and preliminary clinical findings following detethering [^111CwKMm]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). High credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) encompasses congenital conditions with joint contractures in two or more joints. Patients with AMC may have scoliosis and neural axis malformations. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of tethered spinal cord (TSC), characterized by a low-lying conus medullaris, and secondarily, present preliminary findings following surgical untethering in children with AMC.

- **Methods**: Patients 18 years of age and younger with a diagnosis of AMC and a spine MRI were identified. The presence of a TSC was defined as a low-lying conus with termination at or below the lower third of the L2 vertebral body. A pediatric neurosurgeon and a pediatric orthopedic surgeon independently reviewed MRIs. The medical records of patients with AMC who underwent untethering were examined to evaluate preoperative and postoperative clinical findings. The prevalence of TSC in our AMC patients was compared with published normative data using χ² analysis.

- **Results**: Forty-two of 105 AMC patients (40%) had TSCs. There was a greater percentage of patients with AMC and a TSC compared with the unaffected population (P < 0.0001). Sixteen patients underwent detethering through filum terminale sectioning. Nine patients had preoperative neurological deficits in addition to their AMC. There were no postoperative complications. All patients had improvement in their bowel and bladder symptoms within three months after their detethering procedure.

- **Conclusions**: TSC is more prevalent in the pediatric population with AMC compared to those without AMC. MRI is recommended for early detection and management.

### Fetal arthrogryposis: What do we tell the prospective parents [^116FSsrv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis, also termed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, is a descriptive term for conditions with multiple congenital contractures (MCC). The etiology is extremely heterogeneous. More than 400 specific disorders have been identified so far, which may lead to or are associated with MCC and/or fetal hypo- and akinesia as a clinical sign.

With improved sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound and expanding prenatal diagnostic options, clinicians are tasked with providing early detection in order to counsel the prospective parents regarding further prenatal diagnostic as well as management options. We summarize the most important knowledge to raise awareness for early detection in pregnancy.

We review essential points for counseling when MCC is detected in order to provide answers to common questions, which, however, cannot replace interdisciplinary expert opinion in the individual case.

### Recessive mutations in SCYL2 cause a novel syndromic form of arthrogryposis in humans [^114kBwVU]. Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is an important birth defect with a significant genetic contribution. Many syndromic forms of AMC have been described, but they remain unsolved at the molecular level. In this report, we describe a novel syndromic form of AMC in two multiplex consanguineous families from Saudi Arabia and Oman. The phenotype is highly consistent and comprises neurogenic arthrogryposis, microcephaly, brain malformation (absent corpus callosum), optic atrophy, limb fractures, profound global developmental delay, and early lethality. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a different homozygous truncating variant in SCYL2 in each of the two families. SCYL2 is a component of clathrin-coated vesicles, and deficiency of its mouse ortholog results in a severe neurological phenotype that largely recapitulates the phenotype observed in our patients. Our results suggest that severe neurogenic arthrogryposis with brain malformation is the human phenotypic consequence of SCYL2 loss of function mutations.

### Growth-friendly spine surgery in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^111LJFGC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2021). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) describes neonates born with two or more distinct congenital contractures. Despite a spinal deformity prevalence of 3% to 69% among patients, inadequate data exist on growth-friendly instrumentation (GFI) in AMC. Our study aimed to describe GFI trends in children with AMC and early-onset scoliosis (EOS) and to compare long-term outcomes with a matched idiopathic EOS (IEOS) cohort to determine whether spinal rigidity or extremity contractures influenced outcomes.

- **Methods**: Children with AMC and spinal deformity of ≥ 30° treated with GFI for ≥ 24 months were identified from a multicenter EOS database (1993 to 2017). Propensity scoring matched 35 patients with AMC to 112 patients with IEOS with regard to age, sex, construct, and curve. Multivariable linear mixed modeling compared changes in spinal deformity and the 24-item Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) across cohorts. Cohort complications and reoperations were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression.

- **Results**: Preoperatively, groups did not differ with regard to age (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.96), construct (p = 0.62), rate of nonoperative treatment (p = 0.54), and major coronal curve magnitude (p = 0.96). After the index GFI, patients with AMC had a reduced percentage of coronal correction (35% compared with 44%; p = 0.01), larger residual coronal curves (49° compared with 42°; p = 0.03), and a comparable percentage of kyphosis correction (17% compared with 21%; p = 0.52). In GFI graduates (n = 81), the final coronal curve magnitude was 55°…

### Patient-reported outcome measurement information system (PROMIS) scores in pediatric patients with arthrogryposis [^1172Nt1y]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a clinical term used to describe congenital contractures leading to childhood deformities. The treatment aims to maximize function while minimizing pain and disability. Few studies have explored patient-reported outcomes in the pediatric arthrogrypotic population, particularly concerning mobility. This study aimed to report scores for the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire for pediatric patients with arthrogryposis regarding mobility, upper extremity (UE) function, pain interference, and peer relationships.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of 76 patients with AMC aged 5 to 17, who completed the PROMIS questionnaire between January 1, 2017, and March 24, 2020, was performed. Results were collected for four domains: mobility, UE function, pain interference, and peer relationships. Outcomes were stratified by type of arthrogryposis: Amyoplasia (Am), Distal Arthrogryposis (DA), and Other Diagnoses (OD). Results of subjects with isolated upper or lower extremity involvement were compared with those with involvement of both upper and/or lower extremities. Outcomes were correlated with the history of surgical intervention.

- **Results**: Children with Am and OD demonstrated moderate impairment of mobility (average scores: 35.2 and 35.9, respectively), while those with DA reported only mild impairment (average: 44.9). UE function was severely impaired for children with Am (average: 23.0), moderately impaired for OD (average: 33.0), and mildly impaired for DA (average: 43.4).

### Loss-of-function mutations in LGI4, a secreted ligand involved in Schwann cell myelination, are responsible for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^111a8sNi]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a developmental condition characterized by multiple joint contractures resulting from reduced or absent fetal movements. Through genetic mapping of disease loci and whole-exome sequencing in four unrelated multiplex families presenting with severe AMC, we identified biallelic loss-of-function mutations in LGI4 (leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 4). LGI4 is a ligand secreted by Schwann cells that regulates peripheral nerve myelination via its cognate receptor ADAM22 expressed by neurons. Immunolabeling experiments and transmission electron microscopy of the sciatic nerve from one of the affected individuals revealed a lack of myelin. Functional tests using affected individual-derived iPSCs showed that these germline mutations caused aberrant splicing of the endogenous LGI4 transcript and in a cell-based assay impaired the secretion of truncated LGI4 protein. This is consistent with previous studies reporting arthrogryposis in Lgi4-deficient mice due to peripheral hypomyelination. This study adds to the recent reports implicating defective axoglial function as a key cause of AMC.

### Increasing the knee ARC of motion in patients with arthrogryposis: Minimum 2-year follow-up [^1164yU5w]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Low credibility.

Surgery for knee flexion contractures in patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) has achieved extension to redirect the arc of motion and improve ambulation but has not demonstrated maintained increases in total range of motion (ROM). This study aimed to review the clinical outcomes of combined posterior knee release, proximal femoral shortening, and nerve decompression in patients with arthrogryposis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart and radiographic review were performed on patients with AMC who underwent treatment for knee flexion deformities ≥ 30 degrees. ROM, ambulation status, and orthotic use were reviewed and analyzed. Complications were recorded.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine patients with 51 knees and a mean age of 5.7 years were included. The mean follow-up was 36.9 months. The mean ROM increased from 49 to 80 degrees between pre-op and the latest follow-up (P < 0.0001). The mean final follow-up flexion deformity was 10 degrees (P < 0.0001). Preoperative ROM was moderately correlated with final ROM (rₛ = 0.51). The percentage of ambulatory patients improved from 39% to 93%. Five limbs experienced a fracture either intraoperatively or postoperatively, and 5 limbs required a return trip to the operating room.

- **Conclusions**: Improved ambulation and knee ROM can be maintained in patients with AMC at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Prospective investigation and longer follow-up are required to validate these findings.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV-therapeutic.

### Phenotypic spectrum and genomics of undiagnosed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^115ihGCL]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a developmental condition characterized by joint contractures in two or more body areas, resulting from reduced or absent fetal movements. AMC has an overall incidence of 1 in 3,000 to 5,000. The condition directly results from reduced fetal movements, which may lead to additional conditions such as pterygia, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic defects, or cleft palate.

- **Causes of AMC**: There are multiple causes of AMC, including:
	- Genetic defects
	- **Congenital infections**: cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, rubella virus, Zika virus
	- **Extrinsic causes affecting fetal movements**: multiple pregnancy, oligohydramnios, amniotic bands, anatomical abnormalities of the uterus
	- **Maternal immune diseases**: myasthenia gravis

- **Genetic causes**: The genetic causes of AMC identified encompass a large spectrum of diseases. These result from variants in genes encoding components required for:
	- Neuromuscular junctions
	- Skeletal muscle
	- Motor neurons
	- Myelin of the peripheral nerve
	- Connective tissue of tendons and joints
	- Central nervous system, including the brain, with or without spinal cord anomalies

	A total of 402 genes have been reported in connection with AMC.

There are multiple benefits in obtaining a diagnosis and genetic evaluation for patients with AMC and their families. A specific diagnosis can clarify recurrence risks for relatives and is very helpful for the health surveillance and management required, including physical therapy and orthopedic treatment.

### Phenotypic spectrum and genomics of undiagnosed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^115JRo9U]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

This study allowed an evaluation of the pathogenic mechanism through the function of the identified gene. The most frequent cause was a primary involvement of:

- **Skeletal muscle**: 40.6% of index patients (n = 67)
- **Brain with or without spinal cord involvement**: 22.4% (n = 37)
- **Neuromuscular junction**: 17% (n = 28)
- **Axoglial interaction**: 10.3% (n = 17)
- **Spinal cord**: 9.1% (n = 15)

The disease genes known to be associated with brain involvement, including or not including spinal cord, and found in our cohort were:

- **Associated genes**: ALDH18A1 (MIM: 138250), ASXL3, BICD2, BRAT1 (MIM: 614506), CNTNAP1, COG6 (MIM: 606977), ERCC5 (MIM: 133530)

- **Additional associated genes**: MAGEL2, NALCN, PIEZO2 (MIM: 613629), SCN1A, SLC6A9, TOR1A (MIM: 605204), USP9X, ZC4H2

The disease-causing gene was identified in 40 out of 102 patients with syndromic AMC (39.2%), while in non-syndromic AMC (n = 213), the disease gene was identified in 126 patients (59.1%, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed p = 0.0011).

### Successful pregnancy in a woman with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^113KwPmG]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita refers to a clinical condition or syndrome characterized by multiple congenital contractures that affect two or more different areas of the body. Of the cases reported so far, an important percentage had to be terminated before pregnancy term, predominantly by caesarean section. We describe a 36-year-old woman who wanted to conceive. A multidisciplinary approach was set from the preconceptional period with special attention given to respiratory function, potential anesthetic difficulties, and thromboembolic risks. She delivered by caesarean section at 38 weeks. This case emphasizes the possibility of achieving a term delivery in these patients and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team, especially obstetricians and anesthesiologists.

### Investigation into neurogenic bladder in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita [^1174h73n]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

During the follow-up of children diagnosed with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), it was noted that some were experiencing dysfunctional voiding. Further investigation into these cases led to a diagnosis of neurogenic bladder. Few studies have investigated the relationship between AMC and neurogenic bladder, with this being the first to describe the clinical characteristics of neurogenic bladder among these patients.

- **Methods**: A series of 26 cases were obtained from the electronic medical records of patients with AMC who were admitted to Hospital Sarah in Salvador between 1994 and 2007. The patients had all been diagnosed with neurogenic bladder through clinical symptoms, lower urinary tract exams, and urodynamic findings.

- **Results**: There was urinary incontinence in 21 patients (81%), and 50% had a history of urinary tract infections. Renal function was altered in 4 patients (15%) and normal in 22 (85%). In the urodynamic study, 14 patients (64%) had detrusor overactivity and 6 (27%) had underactivity.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with AMC may show changes in the urinary tract, including neurogenic bladder. It is mandatory to study these symptomatic children with urinary disorders.

### Spinal fusion in patients with classic amyoplasia and general arthrogryposis [^112xawVp]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a group of conditions characterized by joint contractures affecting two or more joints. This study describes the results of spinal fusion in patients with classic amyoplasia and general arthrogryposis.

- **Methods**: IRB-approved retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of classic amyoplasia and general arthrogryposis who had a primary definitive posterior spinal fusion between 1990 and 2017 at a single pediatric institution. Patients with distal and syndromic arthrogryposis were excluded, as well as those treated with growth-sparing spinal instrumentation. The Modified Clavien-Dindo-Sink (MCDS) classification system was used to describe postoperative complications.

- **Results**: Over the 28-year period, 342 patients were diagnosed with amyoplasia and general arthrogryposis. Among the 342 patients, 60 (18%) had scoliosis, and 22 (6% of the cohort and 37% of those with scoliosis) were treated surgically. Six patients had growth-sparing techniques, initial fusion elsewhere, or less than one year of follow-up, leaving 15 patients. Of the 15, 9 (60%) had a posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and 6 (40%) had a combined anterior spinal fusion (ASF)/PSF. The ASF/PSF group was significantly younger at surgery, had a greater American Society of Anesthesiologists status, longer surgery duration, and lower implant density. The average preoperative major coronal deformity in ASF/PSF patients (108 degrees) was greater than in patients treated with PSF alone (88 degrees). There were 11 complications in 7 patients, with the most common being deep infection requiring…

### The hand in distal arthrogryposis [^111fjuLi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Distal arthrogryposis is the second most common type of arthrogryposis after amyoplasia and is defined as arthrogryposis that affects the hands and feet; it is mostly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. This review discusses up-to-date background information, clinical features, and treatment of distal arthrogryposis in hands, concentrating on camptodactyly, thumb-in-palm deformity, and windblown hand deformity, which are the most common and functionally limiting deformities. Treating these deformities should be individualized and follow a multidisciplinary approach. Most deformities can be initially treated nonoperatively, and if not responsive, operative treatment may be pursued to improve function. Surgery primarily aims to release soft-tissue contractures, rebalance muscle forces, and may need bony correction based on the deficits of each case. Literature suggests that early treatment leads to better outcomes. However, reported cases are scarce, and no consensus or gold standard for treatment exists. Therefore, long-term (multicenter) studies are needed to assess outcomes and standardize the treatment of such deformities whenever possible.

### Zc4h2 mutations are associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and intellectual disability through impairment of central and peripheral synaptic plasticity [^1166rcB6]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is caused by heterogeneous pathologies leading to multiple antenatal joint contractures through fetal akinesia. Understanding the pathophysiology of this disorder is important for the clinical care of the affected individuals and genetic counseling of the families. We thus aimed to establish the genetic basis of an AMC subtype that is associated with multiple dysmorphic features and intellectual disability (ID).

We used haplotype analysis, next-generation sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, and chromosome breakpoint mapping to identify the pathogenic mutations in families and simplex cases. Suspected disease variants were verified by cosegregation analysis. We identified disease-causing mutations in the zinc-finger gene ZC4H2 in four families affected by X-linked AMC plus ID and one family affected by cerebral palsy. Several heterozygous females were also affected, but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we found two ZC4H2 deletions and one rearrangement in two female and one male unrelated simplex cases, respectively.

In mouse primary hippocampal neurons, transiently produced ZC4H2 localized to the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses, and the altered protein influenced dendritic spine density. In zebrafish, antisense-morpholino-mediated zc4h2 knockdown caused abnormal swimming and impaired α-motoneuron development. All missense mutations identified herein failed to rescue the swimming defect of zebrafish morphants. We conclude that ZC4H2 point mutations, rearrangements, and small deletions cause a clinically valid presentation.
