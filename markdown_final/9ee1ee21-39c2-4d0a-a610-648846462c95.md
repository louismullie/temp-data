## Question

A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of swelling of her legs for 2 months. She has noticed that her legs gradually swell up throughout the day. Two years ago, she underwent a coronary angioplasty. She has hypertension and coronary artery disease. She works as a waitress at a local diner. Her father died of liver cancer at the age of 61 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 31 years. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily and occasionally more on weekends. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. There are several dilated, tortuous veins over both calves. Multiple excoriation marks are noted over both ankles. Peripheral pulses are palpated bilaterally. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
B. Sclerotherapy
C. Compression stockings
D. Adjust antihypertensive medication

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of a 52-year-old woman with bilateral leg swelling and prominent varicose veins, specifically focusing on diagnosis, differential, immediate management, and selecting the best next step among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and the most likely diagnosis. Then, I should verify key differentials to exclude urgent causes. Next, I will align the working diagnosis with current venous classification systems and severity scoring. After that, I need to review first-line management principles and how each proposed option maps to evidence and guidelines. Finally, I will choose the most appropriate next step and justify it with references and practical considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The vignette describes bilateral, progressive pitting edema with visible varicose veins and early skin changes, in a patient with prolonged standing at work, which fits chronic venous disease (CVD) with likely CEAP C2 varicosities and C3 edema, given the pitting nature and progression over the day with excoriations consistent with stasis dermatitis. Wait, let me verify the classification before I commit: CEAP C2 denotes varicose veins, and C3 denotes edema; excoriations and stasis dermatitis are features of skin changes in more advanced CVD, so a CEAP classification of C2s–C3s is reasonable here, with the skin findings indicating progression toward chronic venous insufficiency features despite no active ulcer at this time [^112qrBbN] [^112DRWeJ] [^116DmLqg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without excluding more urgent or alternative etiologies. I should confirm there is no acute DVT: bilateral, chronic pitting edema without focal calf pain or erythema makes acute DVT unlikely, and in any case duplex ultrasound would be the appropriate diagnostic test if DVT were suspected rather than any of the listed options, so DVT does not guide the immediate choice among the answer choices provided [^111KHcGa] [^114aHV9k]. I need to check for systemic causes like heart failure, liver disease, and nephrotic syndrome; the exam shows no JVP elevation, pulmonary crackles, organomegaly, or stigmata of cirrhosis, making systemic causes less likely, though basic labs can be deferred today if stable and chronic. Lymphedema is typically non-pitting and associated with a brawny, fibrotic change, which we do not see here, so that is less likely. Primary lymphedema often starts distally at the toes, and while I almost said the foot-sparing pattern argues against lymphedema, wait, I should correct myself: the early stage of lymphedema can still be pitting and may not show classic toe involvement initially, so I should be cautious; still, the distribution and presence of varicosities steer me toward CVD as the primary process here [^112DswHr] [^11591ZXF] [^113EweB2].

> Next, I should review severity and why we classify it. I need to ensure I use CEAP consistently: C1 telangiectasias/reticular veins, C2 varicose veins, C3 edema, C4 skin changes, C5 healed ulcer, C6 active ulcer. The patient has C2 varicosities with C3 edema and early skin changes, so CEAP C3s is appropriate, and I should document symptoms using the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) to track outcomes over time. Let me double-check that CEAP and VCSS are endorsed for clinical use; yes, contemporary guidelines recommend CEAP for classification and VCSS for severity grading and follow-up, which supports using these tools to standardize assessment and monitor response to therapy [^112qrBbN] [^112DRWeJ].

> Now, I will examine first-line management principles for symptomatic CVD with edema. I should confirm that compression therapy is foundational: guidelines and reviews consistently recommend graduated compression stockings to reduce edema, improve symptoms, and prevent progression, with stronger grades generally more effective but balanced against tolerance and comorbidities. Wait, I should verify whether a compression trial is required before intervention; current guidance suggests compression as primary therapy or a trial when a conservative approach is preferred, but it does not mandate a mandatory pre-intervention compression trial for patients proceeding to endovenous therapy, so I should frame compression as first-line here while acknowledging patient preference and tolerance. I also need to ensure I include lifestyle measures: leg elevation, exercise, weight management, and skin care to prevent stasis dermatitis and excoriations, which are all recommended adjuncts in CVD management [^117BRpjP] [^116eFkFa] [^112ZM2f2] [^111veTjh] [^117Amawn].

> Let me consider each option against the evidence. Option A, CT abdomen/pelvis, is not indicated now; I should confirm that imaging for obstruction is reserved for specific triggers such as suprapubic/abdominal wall varicosities, venous claudication, or CEAP 3–6 with suspected proximal obstruction, none of which are present here. If proximal obstruction were suspected, duplex or venography would be first-line, not CT, so this would be premature and low yield in this presentation [^112VCAWU]. Option B, sclerotherapy, treats cosmetic or symptomatic superficial veins but does not address edema physiology; moreover, guidelines advise treating axial reflux first when present and using sclerotherapy for tributaries or smaller veins, so jumping straight to sclerotherapy before compression and reflux evaluation would be misaligned with best practice. Wait, I should verify the sequence: yes, treat significant reflux sources before tributary sclerotherapy, and reserve sclerotherapy for appropriate vein sizes and symptoms after reflux is addressed [^117DfUJU] [^116Fmqih]. Option D, adjusting antihypertensives, is unlikely to help edema in CVD; calcium channel blockers can worsen edema, and beta-blockers like metoprolol are not edema-sparing, so changing BP meds won't target venous hypertension and could theoretically worsen edema depending on the agent chosen. I should confirm that guideline-based edema management in CVD emphasizes compression and venous interventions rather than antihypertensive adjustment for this indication, which it does [^115bmCRU] [^111veTjh]. Option C, compression stockings, directly addresses venous hypertension, reduces edema, improves symptoms, and is guideline-endorsed first-line therapy for symptomatic CVD with edema, making it the most appropriate next step here [^117BRpjP] [^112ZM2f2].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating the need for imaging or intervention? I should double-check that we are not missing reflux that would change management. The next appropriate step after initiating compression and conservative measures is to obtain a comprehensive lower-extremity venous duplex ultrasound to map reflux and guide any procedural planning; however, among the provided choices, compression stockings remain the best immediate action, with duplex planned shortly thereafter in routine care. This sequencing aligns with ESVS guidance to use duplex as the primary imaging modality in suspected chronic venous disease and with SVS/AVF guidance on when to image for obstruction, which is not triggered by this presentation [^112VCAWU] [^115tXhSs].

> I should also confirm safety and practicality. Compression is safe in the absence of significant peripheral arterial disease; pulses are palpable here, arguing against severe PAD, though ABI can be checked if there are concerns. Let me reconsider adherence barriers: obesity, arthritis, and frailty can impede donning, so patient education and, when needed, donning devices are important; still, guidelines endorse offering compression and tailoring the grade to tolerance and comorbidity, which fits this patient's profile [^112ZM2f2] [^117BRpjP].

> Final decision: The most appropriate next step is compression stockings (Option C), because this directly treats venous hypertension and edema, is first-line and guideline-endorsed for symptomatic CVD with edema, and is the safest, most effective immediate intervention among the choices provided. I should document baseline edema severity, counsel on elevation, exercise, weight management, and skin care, and arrange venous duplex to evaluate reflux patterns once conservative therapy is initiated, with procedural options considered only if symptoms persist or progress despite optimized compression and lifestyle therapy [^117BRpjP] [^112ZM2f2] [^112VCAWU].

---

The most appropriate next step is **compression stockings** [^117BRpjP] because the patient's bilateral pitting edema with dilated, tortuous veins and excoriations is most consistent with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) [^111veTjh], and compression is first-line therapy to reduce edema, improve symptoms, and prevent progression [^112ZM2f2]. Sclerotherapy is for cosmetic or refractory cases after compression, **CT is not indicated without red flags**, and adjusting antihypertensives will not address venous hypertension [^115tXhSs].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Bilateral pitting edema**: Suggests systemic or venous causes; the presence of dilated, tortuous veins and excoriations points to CVI [^113EweB2].
- **Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)**: Caused by venous reflux or obstruction, leading to venous hypertension, edema, varicosities, and skin changes [^115qqHQK].
- **Excoriations**: Indicate stasis dermatitis from chronic venous stasis, supporting CVI [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Features** | **Present in patient** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic venous insufficiency | - Bilateral pitting edema <br/> - Varicose veins <br/> - Stasis dermatitis | Yes |
| Heart failure | - Bilateral edema <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Elevated JVP | No |
| Nephrotic syndrome | - Proteinuria <br/> - Hypoalbuminemia | No |
| Liver cirrhosis | - Ascites <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Hepatomegaly | No |
| Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) | - Unilateral swelling <br/> - Pain <br/> - Erythema | No |
| Lymphedema | - Non-pitting edema <br/> - No varicosities | No |

---

Given the clinical findings, **CVI is the most likely diagnosis** [^notfound].

---

## Recommended next step: compression stockings

Compression stockings are the **first-line therapy** for CVI [^notfound]; they reduce edema, improve symptoms, and prevent progression [^112ZM2f2]. They are indicated for symptomatic varicose veins and edema from venous insufficiency [^112ZM2f2]. Benefits include reduced limb volume, improved quality of life, and fewer ulcers [^notfound].

---

## Why not the other options?

- **CT scan of abdomen and pelvis**: Not indicated without red flags for malignancy or obstruction; no abdominal symptoms or signs are present [^notfound].
- **Sclerotherapy**: For cosmetic reasons or refractory cases after conservative therapy; not first-line for edema management [^notfound].
- **Adjust antihypertensive medication**: Will not address venous hypertension or edema; no evidence of medication-induced edema [^notfound].

---

## Additional management considerations

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, exercise, leg elevation, and skin care [^117Amawn].
- **Follow-up**: Monitor for progression, skin changes, or ulceration [^112DRWeJ].
- **Further evaluation**: If symptoms persist or worsen, consider venous duplex ultrasound to assess reflux or obstruction [^114aHV9k].

---

Compression stockings are the **most appropriate next step** for this patient with CVI, providing symptom relief and preventing progression [^112ZM2f2].

In the past decade, technologies to treat venous pathologies have increased dramatically, to the benefit of an often underserved and overlooked population of patients with venous disease. However, given the rapid release of various technologies, including venous-dedicated stents and thrombectomy devices across varied venous pathologies, evidence-based guidelines have been slow to develop. When discussing appropriateness of care, one needs to consider optimal patient selection, technical approach, medical management, and surveillance protocols, to name a few. All of which, in the venous space, are currently widely varied in practice. The future of deep venous work is limitless, but multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to optimally treat patients with venous disease.

### Rapid post exercise venous refilling time is an independent contributor to chronic venous insufficiency [^116dKnNn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the specific anatomy responsible for rapid P-EVRT remains unclear, at least four potential mechanisms could be contributing. The first hypothesis relates to perforator vein valvular incompetence. Isolated incompetence in these veins would not be measured well by the passive drainage and refill that grades the severity of venous incompetence. During calf muscle contractions, venous blood in the deep veins could be pushed through perforators to the superficial veins, but instead of continuing to flow outward, these veins immediately reflux back with muscle relaxation accounting for rapid refilling. A second hypothesis relates to inefficient and inappropriate CPF. This could be explained by distal displacement of venous blood towards and into the foot, rather than proximal, possibly secondary to isolated deep vein incompetence that may not be well-captured by the more global passive drainage and refill (due to competent proximal valves). A third hypothesis could be related to abnormally increased arterial inflow after calf contractions. This would be most analogous to the pathophysiology of calcium channel blocker-associated edema. Although exercise is known to cause arterial dilation for optimal muscle perfusion, the calf contractions performed in plethysmography testing realistically represent minimal muscle exertion. However, some patients may have inappropriately pronounced arteriole dilation that overwhelms venous outflow response, contributing to venous hypertension and CVI. A fourth hypothesis relates to vein wall compliance. A less compliant vein, due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors, might fill faster due to decreased capacitance. One underrecognized contributor to venous pathology is lymphedema, either primary or secondary, which can lead to venous insufficiency through chronic lymphatic obstruction and impaired interstitial fluid clearance. In such cases, compromised lymphatic drainage may elevate interstitial pressure, promote inflammatory changes, and decrease venous wall compliance. These factors may collectively predispose to rapid P-EVRT. A Japanese case series on primary lymphedema reported early venous return patterns in approximately 60% of patients. These findings support the notion that primary lymphedema may promote P-EVRT even in the absence of typical chronic venous disease risk factors.

### The controversy of managing calf vein thrombosis [^116Pz2hF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists as to whether all calf vein thrombi should be treated with anticoagulation or observed with duplex surveillance. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess whether data could support either approach, followed by examination of its natural history by stratifying results according to early clot propagation, pulmonary emboli (PE), recurrence, and postthrombotic syndrome (PTS).

Methods

A total of 1513 articles were reviewed that were published from January 1975 to August 2010 using computerized database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and extensive cross-references. English-language studies specifically examining calf deep vein thrombosis (C-DVT) defined as axial and/or muscular veins of the calf, not involving the popliteal vein, were included. Papers were independently reviewed by two investigators (E.M. F.L.) and quality graded based on nine methodologic standards reporting on four outcome parameters.

Results

Of the 1513 citations reviewed, 31 relevant papers meeting predefined criteria were found: six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 25 observational cohort studies or case series. There was a single RCT directly comparing anticoagulation with no anticoagulation with compression and duplex surveillance, and they found no difference in propagation, PE, or bleeding in a low-risk population. Based on two studies of moderately strong methodology, C-DVT propagation was reduced with anticoagulation. When treatment was unassigned, moderately strong evidence suggested that about 15% propagate to the popliteal vein or higher. However, based on nonrandomized data but with moderate to high quality (level A and B studies), propagation to popliteal or higher was 8% in those with no anticoagulation treated with surveillance only. Propagation involving adjacent calf veins but remaining in the calf occured in up to one-half of all those who propagate. Major bleeding was an intended endpoint in three RCTs and was reported as 0% to 6%, with a trend toward lower bleeding risk in more recent studies. PE during surveillance in studies with unassigned treatment was strikingly lower than the historical reports of PE recorded at presentation, emphasizing the distinction that must be made between the two entities. Recurrence in C-DVT is lower than thigh DVT, and data suggest that in low-risk groups with transient risk factors, 6 weeks of anticoagulation may be sufficient, as opposed to 12 weeks. Studies of PTS reported that patients with C-DVT had fewer symptoms than their thigh DVT counterparts. Approximately one out of 10 showed symptoms of CEAP Class 4 to 6; however, C5 or C6 with healed or active ulceration were not commonly encountered.

Conclusions

No study of strong methodology could be found to resolve the controversy of optimal treatment of C-DVT. Given the risks of propagation, PE, and recurrence, the option of doing nothing should be considered unacceptable. In the absence of strong evidence to support anticoagulation over imaging surveillance with selective anticoagulation, either method of managing calf DVT must remain as current acceptable standards.

### Distal DVT: worth diagnosing? Yes [^111cpem8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Much of the argument for or against diagnosis of distal deep vain thrombosis (DVT) depends on the extra effort that has to be spent on it. This review presents the data on ultrasound of paired calf veins and calf muscle veins (distal ultrasound) in terms of protocols, feasibility, reliability and expected findings. In summary, provided there is adequate and anatomically sound training of sonographers, distal ultrasound is a valid, 4-minute procedure, which can easily be added to the examination of proximal veins. The second part of the review refers to the pathophysiology of ascending DVT, which is the most common type. Adequate patient care in terms of benefit, harm and cost includes a single non-invasive examination followed by risk adopted treatment allocation. This concept ideally should be valid for any type of DVT. The data extending this concept to distal DVT can only be derived from studies that look closely at this entity (i.e. in fact diagnose distal DVT). Even before these data are available, diagnosing distal DVT at least doubles the number of symptomatic patients in which signs and symptoms can be ascribed to a definitive diagnosis, which in itself is a benefit for patient care.

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^113Lxd19]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

### Approach to leg edema of unclear etiology [^113fbkTh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A common challenge for primary care physicians is to determine the cause and find an effective treatment for leg edema of unclear etiology. We were unable to find existing practice guidelines that address this problem in a comprehensive manner. This article provides clinically oriented recommendations for the management of leg edema in adults. We searched on-line resources, textbooks, and MEDLINE (using the MeSH term, "edema") to find clinically relevant articles on leg edema. We then expanded the search by reviewing articles cited in the initial sources. Our goal was to write a brief, focused review that would answer questions about the management of leg edema. We organized the information to make it rapidly accessible to busy clinicians. The most common cause of leg edema in older adults is venous insufficiency. The most common cause in women between menarche and menopause is idiopathic edema, formerly known as "cyclic" edema. A common but under-recognized cause of edema is pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with sleep apnea. Venous insufficiency is treated with leg elevation, compressive stockings, and sometimes diuretics. The initial treatment of idiopathic edema is spironolactone. Patients who have findings consistent with sleep apnea, such as daytime somnolence, loud snoring, or neck circumference > 17 inches, should be evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with an echocardiogram. If time is limited, the physician must decide whether the evaluation can be delayed until a later appointment (eg, an asymptomatic patient with chronic bilateral edema) or must be completed at the current visit (eg, a patient with dyspnea or a patient with acute edema [< 72 hours]). If the evaluation should be conducted at the current visit, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 could be used as a guide. If the full evaluation could wait for a subsequent visit, the patient should be examined briefly to rule out an obvious systemic cause and basic laboratory tests should be ordered for later review (complete blood count, urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone, and albumin).

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^115RyK6S]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

### May-Thurner syndrome in a case of severe lipodermatosclerosis [^114pMyLc]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes was evaluated by the inpatient dermatology service for a 3-week history of severe left lower extremity swelling, tenderness, and evolving erythema and hyperpigmentation. The patient had a 10-year history of venous insufficiency, left lower extremity swelling, and discomfort. She had undergone endovenous ablation of the left great saphenous vein several years before with some symptom improvement at the time; however, her symptoms had recently worsened. On admission, physical examination of the left leg found significant hyperpigmentation, erythema, tenderness, and edema (Fig 1) along with intact strength and sensation and strong distal pulses. Venous duplex studies found no deep venous thromboses, minimal deep venous reflux, and some superficial varicose veins. The patient was treated for acute LDS with a prednisone taper and completed a course of antibiotics for possible cellulitis, with improvement during her hospital stay.

At outpatient follow-up, the patient reported continued severe left lower extremity pain and swelling and poor ambulatory function. She did not tolerate compression therapy because of pain. She completed her prednisone course and was started on pentoxifylline. She was referred to a vascular surgeon who recommended a venogram study be performed by the interventional radiology department to assess the venous drainage of her left lower extremity.

She subsequently required another hospitalization for severe left lower extremity pain, swelling, and erythema greatly affecting her ability to ambulate. She improved with leg elevation, antibiotics, and prednisone. Hydroxychloroquine was added to her regimen of pentoxifylline, 400 mg 3 times a day. Notably, during both of her admissions, she had no fevers, normal white blood cell counts, and negative blood cultures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left lower extremity found diffuse mild subcutaneous edema and fluid and skin thickening predominantly in the mid to lower calf, both concerning for possible cellulitis.

### Aesthetic treatment of leg veins [^112VBCKF]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The author's preferred treatment for spider veins is sclerotherapy, a technique that uses irritants to obliterate the vessel lumen. She reserves laser treatment for vessels too small to sclerose, matting, and patients who refuse sclerotherapy. Treatment is initiated only after ruling out reflux in the larger superficial venous systems or through the perforators. For long lasting and satisfying results, the author recommends multiple treatments, using the lowest concentration of the most effective sclerosant to achieve vessel obliteration with minimal thrombus formation. She presents a guide to pretreatment evaluation, sclerosing solutions, injection technique, and posttreatment care.

### Peripheral edema [^115bmCRU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### The clinical impact of iliac venous stents in the management of chronic venous insufficiency [^115YpL8C]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was the presentation of the results of iliac venous stent placement in the management of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

Methods

Balloon dilation and stent placement for the relief of iliac vein stenoses was performed in 304 limbs with symptomatic CVI. Sixty-one limbs had concomitant saphenous vein ablation. The median age was 52 years (range, 14 to 83 years). The ratio of postthrombotic to nonthrombotic CVI was 1 to 0.9. The CEAP classification clinical scores were: C(2), 24; C(3), 158; C(4), 60; C(5), 13; and C(6), 49. Associated reflux was present in 57% of the limbs. The procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Intravascular ultrasound scanning was routinely performed because transfemoral venography had poor sensitivity for the detection of iliac vein stenosis.

Results

The actuarial primary and secondary stent patency rates at 24 months were 71% and 90%, respectively. The median degree of swelling (graded 0 to 3, for none, pitting, ankle edema, to gross leg edema) declined from grade 2 to grade 1 after surgery (P < .001). The limbs without any swelling increased from 12% before stenting to 47% after stenting (P < .01). The pain level recorded on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 declined from a median level of 4 to 0 after stent placement (P < .001). The limbs that were completely free of pain increased from 17% before stenting to 71% after stent placement (P < .001). Stasis dermatitis/ulceration was present in 69 limbs. The improvement in swelling and pain was similar in ulcerated and nonulcerated limbs. The cumulative recurrence-free ulcer healing rate was 62% at 24 months. The rate of ulcer healing was similar whether or not concomitant saphenous ablation was performed. Quality of life has significantly improved.

Conclusion

The correction of iliac vein outflow obstruction with the placement of stents results in the significant relief of major symptoms of CVI. The procedure is minimally invasive, can be performed on an outpatient basis, has minimal complications with a high patency rate, and does not preclude subsequent open surgery for the correction of restenosis or the associated reflux. If these preliminary results are sustained for a long-term period, stent placement for the correction of iliac vein stenoses may represent a useful advance in the management of CVI.

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

### Management of varicose veins [^116hvTwL]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Varicose veins are twisted, dilated veins most commonly located on the lower extremities. Risk factors include chronic cough, constipation, family history of venous disease, female sex, obesity, older age, pregnancy, and prolonged standing. The exact pathophysiology is debated, but it involves a genetic predisposition, incompetent valves, weakened vascular walls, and increased intravenous pressure. A heavy, achy feeling; itching or burning; and worsening with prolonged standing are all symptoms of varicose veins. Potential complications include infection, leg ulcers, stasis changes, and thrombosis. Some conservative treatment options are avoidance of prolonged standing and straining, elevation of the affected leg, exercise, external compression, loosening of restrictive clothing, medical therapy, modification of cardiovascular risk factors, reduction of peripheral edema, and weight loss. More aggressive treatments include external laser treatment, injection sclerotherapy, endovenous interventions, and surgery. Comparative treatment outcome data are limited. There is little evidence to preferentially support any single treatment modality. Choice of therapy is affected by symptoms, patient preference, cost, potential for iatrogenic complications, available medical resources, insurance reimbursement, and physician training.

Red vine leaf extract — clinical outcomes reported in chronic venous disease and varicose veins are summarized as follows. A systematic review ("5 trials") reported outcomes including "Leg volume, calf circumference, tired and heavy legs, sensation of tension, tingling and pain" with "In some trials significant improvement of… cutaneous microcirculation and O2 pressure". In adults with CEAP C1s to C4, reports noted "Leg edema reduction assessed by volumetry, and venous symptoms (heaviness, tingling and pain)" with "Significant and relevant clinical efficacy over placebo". In a crossover randomized controlled trial versus placebo among "Adults with CVI grade I or II of Widmer classification n = 71", there was "Improvement of microvascular blood flow, oxygen pressure and leg circumference (P < .0001)". In a trial of "Adults with varicose veins and CEAP C3-C4a n = 248", measures including "Leg volume by water plethysmography" and "Symptoms (10-cm VAS)" showed "Significantly reduced limb volume (P = 0.0268) and improved pain (P = 0.047)". Possible explanations of heterogeneity include "Age, sex, different stages of CVD in patients with varicose veins".

### Varicose veins of the lower extremity secondary to tricuspid regurgitation [^114ZettD]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulsating varicose veins are a rare clinical finding and are mainly derived from tricuspid regurgitation or right heart failure. The precise causes and optimal treatment of this phenomenon have been poorly recorded in the literature. Here, we describe a 56-year-old woman who presented to our medical center with bilateral varicose veins, heaviness, and edema in her lower limbs. The duplex revealed an arterial-like pulsating flow in the superficial and deep veins of the lower extremities, in addition to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Symptoms improved after the patient was given compression therapy using elastic stockings. In this article, we also review six other cases from the literature and discuss the therapies that would be reasonable in some conditions.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^112ZM2f2]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease guideline — compression therapy for symptomatic varicose veins — states: For patients with symptomatic varicose veins, the SCAI guideline panel suggests compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that some patients who value more rapid resolution of symptoms and are less concerned with potential complications may prefer interventional alternatives such as sclerotherapy, phlebectomy, or ablation if appropriate, and that stronger grades of compression therapy may be more effective. The guideline panel identified 7 randomized controlled trials that compared compression with no therapy; three RCTs measured discomfort and 2 studies reported adverse events, while quality of life was reported in 2 of the studies and edema in 1. Most studies assessed improvement in discomfort using a numerical rating scale from 0 or 1 (least pain) to 10 (most pain). Compression therapy may have little to no effect on wound complications, there was no clinically meaningful increase in adverse events, and for patients with advanced peripheral artery disease the panel agreed the risk of limb ischemia is negligible. Implementation considerations include nonadherence due to discomfort and difficulty to apply and remove garments, exacerbated by obesity, pregnancy, joint disease, frailty, and lack of flexibility; within the US, compression hosiery and donning devices are typically not reimbursed and payers are encouraged to cover donning devices. Compression therapy is suggested for symptom and edema relief in CVD of the lower extremities.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^111fLXhy]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema evaluation — swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one "has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up", and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is "important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling". Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus "advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of > 3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema", although "low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema". For diagnostic confidence in early disease, "some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema", and "Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested" in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^11534jRC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

PIL diagnosis is usually made by endoscopic, and histopathologic findings of the small intestines, showing the typical dilated lymphatic vessels in the lamina propria and submucosa. Limb lymphatic vessels can be examined by various radiographic techniques, which can aid in the diagnosis, and to rule out secondary causes of limb lymphedema or chylous effusions. Examples include lymphoscintigraphy, lymphangiography, and magnetic resonance lymphangiography.

Treatment focuses mainly on dietary modification. dietary fat induces dilation of lymphatics even in the normal intestines. Therefore, avoidance of fat decreases excessive dilation and risk of rupture in lymphangiectasia. High MCT containing formulas, and fat restriction along with high protein diet are the cornerstones of treatment for infants, and older children respectively. MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal venous circulation and do not require lymphatic flow for absorption. Octreotide use for the treatment of chylous effusions has been described in the literature. Its effect on the intestines is unclear, but it is hypothesized that it decreases triglycerides absorption, and induces splanchnic vasoconstriction. Albumin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions are frequently indicated as replacement therapies, depending on the levels and clinical scenarios. Other treatment measures include managing any nutritional deficiencies, specifically fat-soluble vitamins.

The most serious but rare long-term complication reported in PIL is intestinal B cell lymphoma. Other complications include nutritional deficiencies, lower extremity cellulitis, and the effects of chronic foot swelling on quality of life.

In conclusion, PIL is a rare disorder that typically presents with protein-losing enteropathy, diarrhea, and bilateral lower limb edema. Nonetheless, unilateral lower limb edema (non-pitting more so than pitting) should not preclude the diagnosis of a systemic disorder, and a high index of suspicion is required in atypical presentations. A good knowledge about PIL, and physical examination skills to differentiate edema or lymphedema from tissue overgrowth can significantly aid in the diagnosis. PIL responds well to dietary modification, but needs long-term monitoring into adulthood, for potentially serious complications.

### Is iPad-based three-dimensional scanning the future for evaluating lower extremity volume or edema in clinic? [^116Jy7gW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned by the authors, objectively measuring lower extremity volumes may be beneficial, particularly for patients with venous disease, because edema is one of the most cumbersome symptoms that our patients suffer from. It is difficult to evaluate the success of treatment, particularly when the main symptom is limb swelling. Traditionally, lower extremity edema or volume has been quantified by measuring the extremity diameter at different points including the ankle, calf, and thigh and comparing those values with previous measurements. However, based on varying techniques, this approach can cause large variations, rendering the measurements inaccurate and unreliable as a way to quantify limb volumes. Specifically for venous disease the Clinical Etiological Anatomical Pathophysiological score is used, but does not really make a differentiation on the severity of edema. The revised Venous Clinical Severity score takes into consideration the severity of the edema: edema is scored as mild if it is limited to the foot and ankle, moderate if it extends above the ankle but below the knee, and severe if it extends to the knee and above. Much clinical decision-making is also based on patient perception of their symptoms. Usually, patients can tell if their edema is stable, improving, or worsening. However, no objective data can be collected based on patient report. Therefore, the authors' attempt to measure lower extremity edema objectively can be very useful in the clinic setting to correlate volume with symptoms and even gauge treatment result.

Lymphedema diagnostic approach — For initial assessment, "clinical recognition of lymphedema is preferred over additional testing", and "Certainly, venous duplex will be done in nearly all patients". "Lymphoscintigraphy or ICG imaging while only available in specialized centers may be helpful to identify stage 0 or I disease or to provide confirmation to patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear". When intervention is contemplated, "Imaging and physiologic testing is required for diagnosis when invasive treatment for lymphedema is planned or when the patient is part of a research trial".

### Leg edema with deep venous thrombosis-like symptoms as an unusual complication of occult bladder distension and right May-Thurner syndrome in a stroke patient: a case report [^116tS7UN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Overt bladder distension can compress the iliac vessels and result in lower extremity swelling mimicking deep venous thrombosis (DVT). This phenomenon has been reported in patients with bladder outlet obstruction due to prostatism but no report has been made in relation to poststroke urinary retention (UR). The authors experienced a rare case of abrupt leg edema with DVT-like symptoms due to iliac vein compression by an overdistended bladder that had developed after cerebrovascular stroke. A 74-year-old woman with left striatocapsular infarction and situs inversus presented with severe right leg swelling. Imaging studies revealed external compression of the right iliac veins by an overdistended bladder and underlying May-Thurner syndrome (MTS). The presence of situs inversus totalis resulted in the rare clinical finding of a right-sided MTS. The patient's symptoms were largely attributable to external compression of right iliac veins by bladder distension and they resolved completely after prompt bladder drainage. Follow-up imaging findings showed complete regression of right external iliac vein stenosis. This case provides the first description of lower extremity swelling manifest as an unusual complication from UR in a stroke patient. Proper and strict bladder screening with appropriate management should be implemented as important therapeutic components during the rehabilitative management of stroke patients.

Case presentation

A man in his early 40s presented to his general practitioner with a 2-week history of bilateral leg pain and swelling, along with lower back pain. The initial symptoms were described as an intense 'sciatica-like' shooting pain down the left leg which occurred at rest. This event lasted approximately 30 min with a '10/10' severity, followed by a spontaneous gradual improvement in discomfort. The pain became a dull ache which was reported to reside at the lower back radiating to both legs. Over the following days, the patient noticed a gradual swelling in both lower limbs, describing both calves and eventually thighs as feeling tight, reducing mobility significantly. The patient denied any recent significant trauma or prolonged period of immobility, although he did report a reduction in his outdoor exercise frequency due to the pandemic social isolation restrictions. The patient was otherwise fit and well, having never suffered any serious medical illness in the past and was not taking any regular medication. The only history of note was the presence of varicose veins in both lower limbs which had been present from his teenage years, for which he had taken to wearing compression stockings in the past. He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough or haemoptysis.

On presenting to his general practitioner, it was found on examination that this male had gross bilateral pitting oedema to his thighs with superficial vessels noted and tenderness along the posterior aspect of both thighs. The legs did not visually appear erythematous on examination and no visible signs of bruising or trauma were apparent. The remainder of his physical examination was normal, with no features suggestive of infection or vasculitis present. A pretest clinical probability Well's score for this male's presentation was 3, placing him at high risk of a DVT.

Discussion

CVI pathophysiology is represented by events that occur within larger superficial and deep veins and events that subsequently occur in the microcirculation and surrounding skin tissue. PTS is a set of CVI symptoms and signs caused by impaired venous outflow due to deep venous obstruction and/or reflux following a DVT. Typical signs are pain with calf compression, varicose veins, edema, and skin color change, like Venous Leg Ulcers (VLUs). This syndrome occurs in 20–50% of DVT patients, maybe more, of whom 5–10% develop severe PTS, such as VLU. Our patient had CVI symptoms before DVT. Therefore, we considered that CVI disease before DVT was one of the DVT causes on the patient's right side. Three years after right lower extremity DVT, the patient had obvious lower limb edema, heaviness, pain, varicose veins, and pigmentation before surgery, which was completely consistent with a PTS diagnosis. The Villalta scale was 15 points before surgery which indicated severe PTS.

In patients with PTS, conservative treatment is the first option and consists of supervised exercise training, compression treatment (usually with elastic compression stockings), and pharmacotherapy, including venoactive drugs (e.g. horse chestnut extract). The patient had tried all conservative treatment in the previous 2 years, with no positive outcomes, thus life and work were seriously affected. Therefore, urgent effective treatments were required.

Surgically treating deep vein incompetence (DVI) is required if patients without outflow obstruction or previously corrected outflow obstruction, and conservative DVI lower limb management has failed, and also severe chronic venous disease (CVD) symptoms and signs persist. Only selected patients with axial reflux at thigh level, across the popliteal vein, and into calf veins are considered for intervention with endovenous or surgical techniques. An ultrasound examination of our patient showed that the thrombus had disappeared completely. An angiography also showed that the right femoral vein flowed back to the distal part of the calf veins, consistent with surgical intervention indications.

### Should we be looking for and treating isolated calf vein thrombosis? [^112VPqMj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Management of isolated calf deep vein thrombosis is an area of significant international debate and variable clinical practice. Both therapeutic anticoagulation and conservative management carry risk. As clinical care of suspected and confirmed venous thromboembolic disease increasingly becomes the remit of emergency medicine, complex decisions are left to practising clinicians at the front door. We aim to provide a contemporary overview of recent evidence on this topic and associated challenges facing clinicians. Given the lack of high-level evidence, we present this work as a narrative review, based on structured literature review and expert opinion. A decision to manage calf thrombosis is principally dependent on the risk of complications without treatment balanced against the risks of therapeutic anticoagulation. Estimates of the former risks taken from systematic review, meta-analysis, observational cohort and recent pilot trial evidence include proximal propagation 7%-10%, pulmonary embolism 2%-3% and death < 1%. Fatal bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation stands at < 0.5%, and major bleeding at approximately 2%. Estimates of haemorrhagic risk are based on robust data from large prospective management studies of venous thromboembolic disease; the risks of untreated calf deep vein thrombosis are based on small cohorts and therefore less exact. Pending further trial evidence, these risks should be discussed with patients openly, in the context of personal preference and shared decision-making. Anticoagulation may maximally benefit those patients with extensive and/or symptomatic disease or those with higher risk for complication (unprovoked, cancer-associated or pregnancy).

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^116ezjgs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Histopathology

Several risk factors were established with the development of venous insufficiency leading to SD, including older age, female sex, pregnancy, obesity, prolonged sitting or standing, heart failure, and family history of venous disease (Table 1). The association with pregnancy and obesity is due to extra stress placed on the patient's lower extremities. Patients who are unable to move may experience leg edema caused by venous stasis that is due to immobility itself and not to anatomical venous complications. Risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle and obesity can be addressed, potentially resulting in disease improvement.

Table 1
Established risk factors for developing stasis dermatitis

SD is typically diagnosed by clinical evaluation of the affected skin and medical history. If the initial diagnosis is inconclusive, duplex ultrasounds can be used to detect the direction of blood flow, assess venous reflux, and identify potential venous obstructions. Widespread use of duplex ultrasound is supported by its accuracy, non-invasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can also be used to detect obstructions in proximal veins and surrounding structures. A diagnosis of SD can be confirmed through biopsy and demonstration of classic histological features of SD, including hemosiderin-laden macrophages, dermal fibrosis, extravasated erythrocytes, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and the proliferation of dilated blood vessels in the papillary dermis. Biopsies are generally avoided because the impaired blood flow in the affected areas of skin can result in poor healing and development of ulcers.

### Interpretation of peripheral venous duplex testing [^114aHV9k]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Venous duplex ultrasound and plethysmography are used to evaluate patients for suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or venous insufficiency symptoms. Testing can provide clinicians with detailed information on location, extent, and severity of venous conditions before and after treatment. Duplex ultrasound can image the venous system from the vena cava to the peripheral veins, including veins of the calf musculature, and is the recommended technique to diagnose DVT. Accurate interpretation of venous testing requires an understanding of venous hemodynamics, including normal flow phasicity with cardiac and respiratory motion and the changes produced by acute DVT. Duplex scanning provides a roadmap of vein anatomy similar to contrast venography and essential hemodynamic information about the presence of proximal obstruction, vein valve function, and perforator vein reflux. Indications for testing include the diagnosis of acute/chronic DVT and evaluation of patients with venous insufficiency manifested as edema, varicose veins, or ambulatory venous hypertension. Venous plethysmography, an indirect physiologic test, can be used to estimate severity of obstructive or reflux venous pathophysiology and document improvement in venous hemodynamics after intervention. Using criteria based on ultrasound imaging and physiologic testing, venous conditions producing a swollen or painful limb can be accurately determined and aid in appropriate treatment selection.

### Review of the literature supporting international clinical practice guidelines on iliac venous stenting and their applicability to Australia and New Zealand practice [^115qqHQK]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Venous disease is common in the general population and carries a significant socioeconomic, physical, and psychological burden, comparable with other chronic conditions (eg, diabetes, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, arthritis), consuming 2% to 3% of health care funding. Because of the high morbidity associated with venous disease and the effects on the patient's quality of life (QOL), an effective treatment is a necessity. Chronic venous disease manifests as a spectrum of conditions ranging from varicose veins, leg edema, recurrent cellulitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and, eventually, venous ulceration, all characterized by retrograde pressurization of the venous system. The pathophysiology of venous hypertension is attributable to calf pump failure, valvular incompetence, VOO, or a combination of these factors. The critical role of venous disorders of the abdomen and pelvis has become increasingly recognized during the past two decades. The Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Physiologic (CEAP) classification was last revised in 2020 and has become the international standard. However, it fails to capture clinical presentations caused by pelvic VOO, including chronic pelvic pain and venous claudication, as well as symptomatic lower extremity varicosities in either atypical (vulva or testicles, medial and posterior thigh, sciatic nerve) or typical saphenous distributions, with the latter frequently recurring after the initial treatment. The new Symptom Varices Pathophysiology classification has been recently published with the aim of aiding clinicians with communication and definition of homogeneous patient populations. When used in combination with the CEAP classification, it can better define these patient groups and assist in decision-making and critical evaluation of outcomes.

VOO

Anatomic obstruction in the abdominopelvic veins can be caused by intraluminal post-thrombotic changes after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or because of external venous compression (most commonly by the iliac arteries), eventually resulting in fibrotic stenosis. The role that venous obstruction plays in the development and progression of venous disease has been recognized for three decades; however, treatment options were limited to open surgery. Consequently, many patients with symptomatic chronic venous disease went untreated, resulting in significant morbidity and a decrease in QOL within that population. With the beginning of the endovascular era in the early 1990s, the treatment paradigm shifted, and venous stenting became the standard of care for patients with clinically significant deep venous obstructive disease advocated by numerous societal guidelines.,

Venous disorder is common in the general population. Uncomplicated varicose veins represent a significant proportion of the disease burden, and can impact considerably on quality of life, producing a wide spectrum of symptoms. Little is known about the natural course of the disease at this stage and the treatment strategy employed is often not based on robust scientific evidence. The aim of this article is to elucidate the options to manage uncomplicated varicose veins. There are likely to be significant geographic differences in the treatment strategy employed, and it is hoped that we will arouse discussion among physicians regarding the management of this very common medical condition. The reader will be asked for their preferred treatment choice for a given clinical case vignette.

Evaluation of patients with varicose veins — classification and grading: We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research. Rationale notes the CEAP system was designed in 1994, updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020, and is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders.

Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1, and varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter with patients belonging to CEAP Class C2. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a), and symptoms of varicose veins may include the HASTI set: heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching.

### Adult woman presenting progressive enlargement of mass on the left leg [^11591ZXF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Lower extremity lymphedema is caused by the excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. The initially affected area of lower extremity lymphedema was the distal part of the leg such as the ankle, foot, and toes. The foot of the patient is completely spared.
B. Chronic venous disease (CVD) – Incorrect. CVD is associated with telangiectasias, varicose veins, swelling, and skin changes. Leg swelling of CVD often occurs in ankles and calves, while the feet are usually spared, and it can be effectively improved by leg elevation.
C. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) – Correct. PNs are benign nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The family history of NF1 is significant in her father and aunt. The MRI result showed a well-demarcated, encapsulated, ≥ 3 cm lesion matching the imaging features of PNs. Histologically, they exhibit a typical composition of spindled with wavy, tapered, and comma-shaped nuclei.
D. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) – Incorrect. KTS is a congenital disorder characterized by capillary, lymphatic, and venous system malformation, as well as bone and/or soft tissue hypertrophy. MRI can identify the asymmetric soft tissue hypertrophy and osteohypertrophy of the leg. Leg function impairment secondary to hypertrophy can be observed in KTS, but many patients demonstrated a reduced body area rather than increased growth. By comparison, most PNs are characterized by continuous growth and PN shrinkage mainly occurs in adults. Vascular masses, dilated superficial veins, and flat hemangiomas can also be assessed by color duplex ultrasound and venography. These vascular anomalies are significant clinical features of KTS but are rarely present in PNs.
E. Lipedema – Incorrect. Lipedema is associated with abnormal deposition of subcutaneous adipose, leading to the disproportional increase of lower extremities in the volume. Digital pressure on the affected limbs can induce leg pain. Leg swelling worsens with standing and cannot be effectively alleviated by limb elevation therapy.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is estimated to occur in 1 in 1000 persons annually in adult populations, with prevalence predicted to double by the year 2050. While acute DVT and pulmonary embolism are a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the long-term prognosis for patients with venous thromboembolism is in part determined by the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which occurs in up to 50% of patients. PTS refers to a chronic syndrome complex, invariably characterized by intractable edema, pain, stasis dermatitis, and venous stasis ulceration when severe.

### Recurrent preeclampsia in a pregnant woman with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: two cesarean deliveries and multiple extremity involvement-a case report and literature review [^113cJJ2K]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Skin-related complications are present in 45% of KTS patients, most commonly associated with lymphatic malformations, venous malformations in the genital area or feet. Additionally, hemihypertrophy of the brain and cerebellar hemispheres has been detected in 18% of KTS patients, which is important for understanding the effects of KTS on the central nervous system. A wide range of intracranial neurovascular anomalies, particularly in the venous system, have been shown to be common in these patients.

During pregnancy, KTS can lead to serious complications. The literature reports that complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, severe PPH, and preeclampsia are common in pregnant women with KTS. These complications require a multidisciplinary approach and can be successfully managed with careful obstetric management. Our study discusses the clinical course and treatment of a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with KTS who developed preeclampsia. The patient had hypertrophy on the right side, port-wine stains on the jaw and neck, swelling and edema in both legs, deformity in the right big toe, and difficulty walking. The patient, who showed symptoms of high blood pressure and headache during her pregnancies, delivered two healthy baby girls by cesarean section. Despite having uterine and liver involvement, the absence of PPH in our patient differs from the results reported in the literature. In this case, the effects of KTS on pregnancy, the management of additional complications such as IUGR and preeclampsia required a multidisciplinary approach and prevented maternal bleeding.

### Varicose veins: diagnosis and treatment [^116Rm3Ar]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Varicose veins are twisted, dilated veins most commonly located on the lower extremities. The exact pathophysiology is debated, but it involves a genetic predisposition, incompetent valves, weakened vascular walls, and increased intravenous pressure. Risk factors include family history of venous disease; female sex; older age; chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, or a tumor; and prolonged standing. Symptoms of varicose veins include a heavy, achy feeling and an itching or burning sensation; these symptoms worsen with prolonged standing. Potential complications include infection, leg ulcers, stasis changes, and thrombosis. Conservative treatment options include external compression; lifestyle modifications, such as avoidance of prolonged standing and straining, exercise, wearing nonrestrictive clothing, modification of cardiovascular risk factors, and interventions to reduce peripheral edema; elevation of the affected leg; weight loss; and medical therapy. There is not enough evidence to determine if compression stockings are effective in the treatment of varicose veins in the absence of active or healed venous ulcers. Interventional treatments include external laser thermal ablation, endovenous thermal ablation, endovenous sclerotherapy, and surgery. Although surgery was once the standard of care, it largely has been replaced by endovenous thermal ablation, which can be performed under local anesthesia and may have better outcomes and fewer complications than other treatments. Existing evidence and clinical guidelines suggest that a trial of compression therapy is not warranted before referral for endovenous thermal ablation, although it may be necessary for insurance coverage.

### Predicting deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy: external validation of the LEFT clinical prediction rule [^11615gQc]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The assessment of clinical probability represents an important step in the diagnostic strategy of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. The recently derived LEFt clinical prediction rule for pregnant women combines three variables: symptoms in the left leg (L), calf circumference difference of 2 centimeters or over (E for edema) and first trimester presentation (Ft) but is lacking an external validation. The LEFt rule was computed among pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis who were included in a multicenter prospective diagnostic management outcome study. We calculated the proportion of women and the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in each probability group, along with the diagnostic performances of the LEFt rule. All variables needed to compute the rule could be retrieved in 157 of the 167 pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of confirmed deep vein thrombosis was 13 of 157 (8.3%). The LEFt rule was negative in 46 (29%) women. A deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 13 of 111 (11.7%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 8.3–20.9%) of women with at least one of the LEFt criteria, as compared with none of 46 (0.0%, 95%CI: 0.0–7.9%) of women with none of the LEFt criteria. These results suggest that a negative LEFt rule accurately identifies pregnant women in whom the proportion of confirmed deep vein thrombosis appears to be very low. The rule should not be used as stand-alone test for excluding DVT during pregnancy, but might rather be implemented in a diagnostic strategy in association with D-dimer measurement and compression ultrasonography.

Recommendations and statements

1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins

1.1. Classification and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders

1.1.1. We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research.

Good Practice Statement

Rationale and evidence

The CEAP classification was designed at a consensus meeting of international experts in 1994, it was updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020. The classification is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP Class C2. CVD is defined as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a). Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning, cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg or itching. The most important of these have been identified as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. CEAP is a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring system, or an outcome measure that reflects changes over time. For a table of the updated CEAP classification please see Part I of the Guidelines.

1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

### Management of venous thromboembolism – controversies and the future [^111PLKNm]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines there are difficult and controversial areas in the management of venous thromboembolism. Institutions and even countries disagree on the importance of calf vein thrombosis, with some rigorously detecting and treating it and others deliberately not looking for it. The need to treat proximal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is accepted but which patients with an unprovoked first event should have long-term anticoagulation has become a difficult clinical decision. We are uncertain how to reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome seen in a substantial number of patients. How hard to look for an undiagnosed underlying cancer has become a contentious issue particularly in the United Kingdom following the recent publication of a guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Whilst we are wrestling with these dilemmas we are entering an era of new anticoagulants and have to solve the logistical problems of introducing them into clinical practice despite cost pressures. These issues will be explored in this review.

History

A 45-year-old Nigerian man presented with a 6-month history of hyperpigmentation and progressive edema to the lower legs. His medical history was significant for HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 20 and an HIV viral load of 58863 copies per milliliter. He denied any infectious symptoms, such as cough, fever, dyspnea, or rigors. On his lower legs, he had woody, indurated, nonpitting edema, with large hyperpigmented patches and minimally elevated plaques (Fig 1). At follow-up 5 months later, the edema of his legs now extended to his proximal thighs and he had a new, hyperpigmented, indurated plaque on his lateral left thigh (Fig 2).

Measurements

The clinical metrics evaluated included the venous clinical severity score (VCSS; range, 0–27 [range, 3–30 for compression stockings]), grade of swelling (GOS; score range, 0–4), and the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (score range, 0–10). The GOS was categorized as 0, no swelling; 1, pitting, nonobvious swelling; 2, visible ankle swelling; 3, gross swelling involving the leg up to the knee; and 4, gross swelling involving the entire leg, including the thigh. All scores were appraised at every clinic follow-up visit. QoL was assessed using the CIVIQ-20. For the CIVIQ-20, the maximum score of 100 indicates the worst possible QoL, and a score of 0 indicates the best possible QoL. The last follow-up response available was used in the postoperative outcome analysis. For the lymphedema outcomes, the best, worst, and present pain for each patient was recorded at the first and last visit of MLD therapy. The lymphedema life impact score (LLIS) and the percentage of impairment data were also recorded before and after treatment completion. LLIS was developed as a comprehensive, lymphedema-specific instrument to assess the effects of lymphedema on any extremity. Finally, circumferential measurements of the knee, upper calf, mid-calf, malleolus, and mid-foot (in cm) were taken at each visit to record any decrease in swelling with MLD. The measurements before and after the last MLD visit were used for analysis. For those patients who underwent CDT and those who underwent stenting followed by CDT, the follow-up times were 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of MLD.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism, version 8 (GraphPad). Comparisons were performed at baseline and after CDT or stenting using unpaired and paired t tests. The limb count used for analysis is noted in the results when appropriate. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess stent patency after intervention, with the log-rank test used to discriminate between the curves. P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant.

FCS is a recognized clinical entity that has few consistent clinical signs except tense swelling. A high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to provide appropriate treatment. Invasive direct pressure monitoring is needed to diagnose FCS. High-energy injuries are known to cause FCS, but individual risk factors, such as prolonged venous occlusion and blood dyscrasias, are causative factors.

C3 edema — panel ratings and clinical considerations: The panelists rated interventions for treatment of leg edema due to venous disease (CEAP class 3) as may be appropriate for several scenarios in considering saphenous vein ablations and perforator, iliac, and IVC treatments. Panelists indicated that swelling may be multifactorial and can be associated with numerous coexisting nonvenous causes that would not be expected to benefit from venous interventions. In contrast, when a patient presents with varicose veins, reflux, and edema, the group thought intervention more likely to be of benefit with improved reduction of swelling, in which case the indication for treating venous reflux would be stronger. Unilateral limb swelling was also noted by panelists to be a potential predictor of a favorable response. The response of edema C3 to either ablation for isolated below-knee GSV reflux or segmental vein reflux is not supported by data and led to a rating of may be appropriate, and more research is needed to determine its usefulness for these indications. In general, for several C3 indications, a wide dispersion of ratings was observed, which may at least in part have been due to differences in how C3 was perceived.
