## Question

A 55-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a routine physical examination. She says she has had some fatigue during the past six months but is otherwise feeling well.
Medical history includes anxiety treated with sertraline 50 mg daily and insomnia treated with trazodone 100 mg nightly.
Pulse rate is 68/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmg.
Physical examination shows splenomegaly. Complete blood cell count shows a white blood cell count of 58.500/mm?
(3500–10,000/mm?) with an increase in basophils and eosinophils. A peripheral blood smear shows < 2% blasts;
Döhle bodies are not noted. Hemoglobin level is 13.5 g/dL
(11.5–15.5 g/dL), and platelet count is 200,000/mm?
(130,000–400,000/mm'). Further testing shows a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 with a positive
BCR-ABL1 gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to determine the most likely diagnosis for a 55-year-old woman with leukocytosis, basophilia, eosinophilia, splenomegaly, and a confirmed BCR-ABL1 fusion, and to articulate why competing diagnoses are excluded. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core hematologic features and whether they fit a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Then, I should verify the molecular hallmark and how it anchors the diagnosis. Next, I will stage the disease by blast percentage and clinical features. After that, I need to consider and exclude key mimics such as BCR-ABL1-positive AML, Ph-like ALL, other MPNs, and reactive leukocytosis. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline immediate next steps in management and monitoring, ensuring each assertion aligns with guidelines and contemporary reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical and laboratory phenotype. The patient has marked leukocytosis with increased basophils and eosinophils, splenomegaly, and a peripheral smear showing less than 2% blasts, with hemoglobin and platelets within normal limits; this constellation is classic for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary reviews and guidelines as the typical presentation in developed countries, particularly with basophilia and splenomegaly accompanying the leukocytosis [^116di76R] [^114ieGNV] [^115tW3UQ].

> Wait, let me verify the molecular anchor before concluding anything. The presence of a t(9;22)(q34; q11) translocation with a BCR-ABL1 fusion is the defining molecular hallmark of CML; I should confirm that this is indeed present and that the testing modality is appropriate. The case states BCR-ABL1 is positive, and in most adults the major breakpoint (p210, e13a2/e14a2) predominates, which fits the expected biology and supports CML as the unifying diagnosis rather than an alternative myeloid neoplasm [^112n5WKT] [^1118Nxm2] [^116di76R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about phase; I need to check the blast threshold. With less than 2% blasts in peripheral blood, this meets criteria for chronic phase CML rather than accelerated or blast phase, which require higher blast counts or additional adverse features; this aligns with NCCN and ELN phase definitions and reinforces that the most likely diagnosis is chronic-phase CML [^114DqEMe] [^117JowR3].

> Next, I should review the differential and actively exclude mimics. BCR-ABL1-positive AML would typically show 20% or more blasts and lacks the chronic myeloid maturation pattern seen here, so the low blast count argues strongly against AML; similarly, Ph-like ALL presents with lymphoblasts and a BCR-ABL1-like gene expression signature without the actual BCR-ABL1 fusion, which is not the case here, and the smear shows myeloid maturation rather than lymphoblasts, making ALL unlikely [^114NocaR] [^112mfh3u].

> I will now examine other MPNs that could be confused with this presentation. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical CML are BCR-ABL1-negative and require the absence of BCR-ABL1, so the presence of BCR-ABL1 effectively excludes them; essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera are Philadelphia-negative MPNs defined by JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations and do not feature the BCR-ABL1 fusion, so they are incompatible with this molecular result; myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusions (e.g. FIP1L1-PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2) are also BCR-ABL1-negative and would not fit here [^116HBCPH] [^1152B3Mx] [^116EqHXe] [^115MyRej].

> But wait, what if this is a leukemoid reaction or another reactive process? Reactive neutrophilia can occasionally reach high WBC counts, yet the presence of basophilia and eosinophilia, left-shifted myeloid maturation, and splenomegaly are not expected in reactive states; moreover, the definitive detection of BCR-ABL1 resolves that question definitively in favor of clonal disease rather than a secondary response, so I should not over-attribute symptoms to anxiety or medication effects here [^113GGVeD].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The combination of leukocytosis with basophilia and eosinophilia, splenomegaly, a myeloid left shift with very low blasts, and a confirmed BCR-ABL1 fusion establishes the diagnosis of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia; fatigue is a common symptom at diagnosis and does not alter the phase classification in this context, and the normal hemoglobin and platelets are compatible with early chronic-phase disease [^116di76R] [^1118Nxm2] [^115tW3UQ].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps in management and monitoring. I need to ensure baseline risk stratification with Sokal, Euro/Hasford, or ELTS prior to therapy, obtain a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for morphology and full cytogenetics with at least 20 metaphases, and establish a quantitative BCR-ABL1 transcript baseline on the International Scale; if bone marrow is not feasible, FISH on peripheral blood can substitute for cytogenetics, and I should also screen for hepatitis B before initiating a TKI and plan q3-month molecular monitoring thereafter [^114fY6qh] [^111HmBeR] [^117JowR3] [^11292YfF].

> I should double-check treatment initiation timing. Guidelines recommend starting a tyrosine kinase inhibitor promptly after confirmation of BCR-ABL1 positivity; first-line options include imatinib or a second-generation agent such as dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib, chosen based on risk, comorbidities, and drug–drug interactions, with the primary goal being prevention of progression to accelerated or blast phase [^113ZFnmw] [^1118Nxm2].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the final statement is precise. The most likely diagnosis is chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia, defined by BCR-ABL1 positivity, leukocytosis with basophilia and eosinophilia, splenomegaly, and fewer than 10% blasts in blood and marrow, with the low blast count here placing the patient squarely in chronic phase and all competing diagnoses excluded by the molecular hallmark and clinical phenotype [^1118Nxm2] [^115tW3UQ].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase** [^1118Nxm2], defined by the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) and BCR-ABL1 fusion [^116di76R], with leukocytosis, basophilia, eosinophilia, and splenomegaly [^115tW3UQ]. The **< 2% blasts** and preserved hemoglobin/platelets confirm chronic phase [^notfound], not accelerated or blast phase [^114DqEMe]. Immediate **TKI therapy** (e.g. imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) is indicated to prevent progression and achieve durable remissions [^113ZFnmw] [^1118Nxm2].

---

## Clinical features supporting CML diagnosis

- **Leukocytosis**: Marked neutrophilia with myeloid left shift is typical of CML [^116tCU6H].
- **Basophilia and eosinophilia**: Common in CML due to clonal myeloid proliferation [^115tW3UQ].
- **Splenomegaly**: Frequent from extramedullary hematopoiesis [^116di76R].
- **Fatigue**: Common constitutional symptom in CML [^116di76R].

## Laboratory findings consistent with CML

| **Laboratory test** | **Findings in this patient** | **Typical findings in CML** |
|-|-|-|
| White blood cell count | 58,500/mm³ | Elevated (typically > 100,000/mm³) |
| Hemoglobin | 13.5 g/dL | Normal or mildly decreased |
| Platelet count | 200,000/mm³ | Normal or mildly increased |
| Peripheral smear | - < 2% blasts <br/> - No Döhle bodies | - < 5% blasts <br/> - Myeloid left shift |
| Cytogenetics | t(9;22) translocation | Philadelphia chromosome |
| Molecular testing | BCR-ABL1 positive | BCR-ABL1 fusion gene |

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions

- **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)**: Excluded by < 2% blasts and absence of AML features [^notfound].
- **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)**: Excluded by myeloid lineage and low blast count [^notfound].
- **Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)**: Excluded by BCR-ABL1 positivity [^111qNdEQ].
- **Reactive leukocytosis**: Excluded by clonal BCR-ABL1 fusion [^113GGVeD].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

- **Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy**: Confirm chronic phase and assess fibrosis [^117JowR3].
- **Quantitative RT-PCR**: Establish BCR-ABL1 transcript baseline [^111HmBeR].
- **Risk stratification**: Use Sokal, Euro, or ELTS scores [^114fY6qh].

---

## Management and prognosis

- **First-line therapy**: TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) are standard [^113ZFnmw].
- **Monitoring**: Regular BCR-ABL1 qPCR to guide therapy [^11292YfF].
- **Prognosis**: Excellent with TKI therapy; normal life expectancy is common [^111Svwr5].

---

The patient's presentation and labs are classic for **CML in chronic phase** [^116di76R]; prompt TKI therapy and molecular monitoring are essential for optimal outcomes [^113ZFnmw] [^11292YfF].

### Prognostic significance of early molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^113KgwHE]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man presented with splenomegaly (10 cm below left costal margin) and leucocytosis (145 × 10(9)/L). Differential showed neutrophilia with increased basophils (2%), eosinophils (1.5%), and left shift including myeloblasts (3%). A diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was established after marrow cytogenetics demonstrated the Philadelphia chromosome. Molecular studies showed a BCR-ABL1 qPCR result of 65% on the International Scale. Imatinib therapy at 400 mg daily was initiated due to patient preference, with achievement of complete hematological response after 4 weeks of therapy. BCR-ABL1 at 1 and 3 months after starting therapy was 37% and 13%, respectively (all reported on International Scale). Is this considered an adequate molecular response?

### Concomitant JAK2 V617F-positive polycythemia vera and BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with ruxolitinib and dasatinib [^113YXt6j]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are myeloid malignancies characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation. There are seven designated conditions under the category of MPNs including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and polycythemia vera (PV).CML is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 that results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. PV is a Ph-negative MPN characterized by erythrocytosis and the presence of an activating JAK2 mutation in > 95% of cases. PV and CML are considered to be mutually exclusive; however, rare cases of concurrent Ph-positive CML and a JAK2 V617F-positive PV have been described in the literature. Previous reports have suggested that the two disorders may arise independently, or from within the same clone, but definitive clonal analysis has never been documented. We report a case of a patient with JAK2 V617F-positive PV who subsequently developed chronic phase Ph-positive CML. The patient was successfully treated with the combination of dasatinib and ruxolitinib. Cytogenetic and molecular responses suggested that the two disorders arose independently, which was corroborated by genotyping analyses of single-cell-derived colonies.

A 55-year-old woman was first diagnosed with PV in 2001 when she presented with a hemoglobin (Hgb) of 20.0 g/dl. Over the ensuing 10 years, the patient was treated with aspirin and intermittent hydroxyurea and anagrelide, with poor compliance. In May 2011 (10 years after initial PV diagnosis), she presented with worsening fatigue, weight loss and splenomegaly. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 45 × 10 9 /l and a Hgb of 9.5 g/dl. Examination of the peripheral smear demonstrated leukoerythroblastic changes with few circulating blasts. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellularity with granulocytic and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, no excess blasts, and moderate fibrosis on reticulin staining. A diagnosis of post-PV myelofibrosis was initially suspected; however, cytogenetics showed t(9;22) in 20 out of 20 metaphase cells and fluorescence in situ hybridization for BCR-ABL was positive (92.5%). Quantitative PCR for JAK2 V617F revealed an allele burden of 6%. Therefore, it appeared that the patient had developed CML with relative clonal dominance over PV.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia: a review [^116di76R]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic myeloid leukemia:

- **Definition**: CML is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: CML is caused by a chromosomal abnormality termed as Philadelphia chromosome, which results from the presence of BCR-ABL oncogene.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, abdominal fullness, bleeding, purpura, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Disease progression may lead to bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, infections, lymphadenopathy, CNS disease, and increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CML is associated with a mortality crude rate of 0.78.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1118Nxm2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t9;22] that gives rise to a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. CML occurs in 3 different phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast phase) and is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase in developed countries. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is a highly effective treatment option for patients with chronic phase-CML. The primary goal of TKI therapy in patients with chronic phase-CML is to prevent disease progression to accelerated phase-CML or blast phase-CML. Discontinuation of TKI therapy with careful monitoring is feasible in selected patients. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic phase-CML.

### Front-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia [^112LSkeL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 40-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension and occasional premature ventricular contractions was found on routine blood work in June 2011 to have mild thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 405,000. In November 2011, repeat analysis revealed a platelet count of 433,000, and by February 2012 her platelet count was 509,000. She had no evidence of leukocytosis or anemia and no symptoms of early satiety, night sweats, pruritus, or erythromelalgia. She was referred to a hematologist for evaluation of persistent isolated thrombocytosis in March 2012. Her spleen was not palpable, and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for JAK2/V617F was negative. A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed a mildly hypercellular marrow (70% to 80% cellularity), with an elevated myeloid:erythroid ratio of 5:1, increased megakaryocytes including micromegakaryocytes in the absence of increased blasts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in 17 out of 20 metaphases. The remaining three metaphases were normal karyotype. Quantitative PCR for BCR-ABL1 yielded a value of 29.6% on the International Scale.

### BCR:: ABL1-positive acute myeloid leukemia [^114NocaR]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The patient was treated with cytarabine, idarubicin, and imatinib as induction treatment (preceded by cytoreduction with hydroxycarbamide), followed by cytarabine and imatinib for consolidation. Additionally, cytarabine, methotrexate, and methylprednisolone were administered intrathecally to treat demonstrated central nervous system infiltration. Complete remission was achieved with the marrow being morphologically normal without neutrophilic, eosinophilic or basophilic hyperplasia. Cytogenetic analysis was normal at 2 months from diagnosis and a deep molecular remission was demonstrated at 4 months.

Diagnosis of BCR::ABL1 ‐positive AML requires the features of AML and demonstration of BCR::ABL1. However an essential diagnostic criterion is that there should be "a lack of features of CML before or at diagnosis and after therapy". The diagnosis is thus provisional until post‐treatment follow‐up excludes an alternative diagnosis of blastic presentation of CML. De novo AML cases have less frequent splenomegaly, a higher blast percentage and lower basophil numbers. The precise BCR::ABL1 transcript that is detected is not helpful because p210 is most often observed in both CML and BCR::ABL1 ‐positive AML.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions — clinical presentation includes extramedullary manifestations and systemic symptoms. EMD may present as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-ALL or B-ALL, or mixed phenotype blast phase disease and may occur alone or with chronic or blast phase disease involving bone marrow or peripheral blood, with lineage potentially differing between sites. These neoplasms are associated with a variety of symptoms, with the most common being weakness and fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgias or angioedema, rash or fever, and rhinitis, alongside blood count abnormalities such as neutrophilia, basophilia, thrombocytosis, monocytosis, myeloid immaturity, and mature or immature eosinophils with dysplasia plus anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

### Chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 + [^1144EjWL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Session 1 of the 2007 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology focused on chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1+ (CML). CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm arising at the level of a pluripotent stem cell and consistently associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. CML most commonly manifests in a chronic phase of the disease with neutrophilic leukocytosis, and the demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome is the ultimate confirmation of the diagnosis. However, in select cases, the initial diagnosis remains challenging, and a number of issues pertaining to the manifestations and disease evolution remain unresolved. These issues have been illustrated by the cases submitted to our workshop and include unusual manifestations of CML, including manifestation in the accelerated and/or blast phase, and patterns of disease progression and therapy resistance in the era of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

### A novel colony stimulating factor 3 receptor activating mutation identified in a patient with chronic neutrophilic leukemia [^111Yszot]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

CSF3R N579Y was identified in a patient presenting with a myeloproliferative neoplasm with neutrophilia and splenomegaly. The patient was a 55-year-old man with a 3-month history of progressive fatigue and a 40-pound weight loss. At the time of his initial presentation, his white blood count was 96.48x10 9 /L with a differential of 3% bands, 74% neutrophils, 4% lymphs, 3% monocytes, 6% metameyelocytes, 8% myelocytes, and 2% promyelocytes. Hemoglobin was 10.9 g/dL and platelets were 740x10 9 /L. One year prior, his WBC had been normal with a mild monocytosis. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy revealed a markedly hypercellular (90% cellular) BM exhibiting myeloid-predominant maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with left-shifted myeloid maturation, mild megakaryocytic atypia (small, hypolobated forms), mild reticulin fibrosis most consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Given the myeloid-predominant BM without significant dysgranulopoiesis in the context of peripheral leukocytosis with peripheral neutrophilia, a diagnosis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) was favored. However, the left-shifted myeloid maturation and reticulin fibrosis is atypical. CML was excluded given the absence of a BCR-ABL1 positive fusion transcript, and aCML was excluded due to lack of significant dysgranulopoiesis. The patient had had a history of a seizure substance use disorder and had subsequently been found unresponsive with a large intracranial hemorrhage. He was started on hydroxyurea and transitioned to a palliative approach before succumbing to his disease. It had not been possible to perform germline testing.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^115KKkpL]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

BCR::ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) presents with a typical phenotype in over 95 percent of cases. These are associated with a p210kDa oncoprotein (M-bcr genotype). In these cases, the consideration of CML is high on the differential diagnosis list and appropriate genetic studies to confirm the BCR::ABL1 oncogene are de rigueur. The elevated white cell count, dominant granulocytes, myeloid immaturity and the absent to low blast concentration in the blood, the mild anemia, the normal platelet count or mild thrombocytosis and the frequency of basophilia usually point to the tentative diagnosis of CML or CML is included in the differential diagnosis without ambiguity. In a very small fraction of cases, the diagnosis of BCR::ABL1-positive CML is less evident. These syndromes include (i) BCR::ABL1-positive thrombocythemia, (ii) so-called neutrophilic BCR::ABL1-positive CML and (iii) the m-bcr (p190BCR-ABL1) variant of CML, often with an absolute and relative monocytosis. In these uncommon forms, there are often misleading blood cell counts. An interesting biological feature is the striking predominance of females in these three atypical presentations. In the fourth variant, (iv) eosinophilic predominant CML, the five reported cases have all been in males. We also consider the very rare phenomenon of (v) smoldering CML (syn. pre-CML or aleukemic CML), which also has a female predominance. The misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of these atypical syndromes is consequential because of the beneficial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in these patients.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^112ijq6f]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In a review of 23 cases of m- bcr CML reported in the medical literature, the white cell count was frequently lower than expected and basophilia was less frequent (9 of 20 cases had 0 to 1% basophils).

Isolated case reports highlight the dramatic deviations of blood counts from the classical expectation. For example, a case with a hemoglobin concentration of 15.6 g/L, an initial white cell count of 11.8x10 9 /L composed of 50% neutrophils, 19% monocytes and 2% basophils and with an uninformative bone marrow examination was a diagnostic enigma. Sequencing for gene mutations associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was unrevealing. A karyotype eventually led to the diagnosis of p190 BCR-ABL1 CML. Other case reports of striking monocytosis as the principal feature highlight its presence in most cases of p190 BCR-ABL1 CML. In one report reviewing ten cases of p190 BCR-ABL1 with monocytosis, the monocyte count ranged from 2.5 to 38.4x10 9 /L with a median of 20.2x10 9 /L.

Splenomegaly is less prominent than in CML with the classical BCR breakpoint (M- bcr). Thirteen of 20 cases of m- bcr CML did not have splenomegaly at the time of diagnosis. These reports highlight the importance of testing for the BCR::ABL1 oncogene in cryptic cases of apparent myeloid neoplasms with monocytosis, low white cell counts, and the absence of basophilia and splenomegaly. This need is made poignant by the availability of TKI therapies, although m- bcr CML is associated with an inferior response to TKI compared to M- bcr CML. Not infrequently, the initial consideration is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia but gene sequencing does not disclose the somatic mutations most often associated with that diagnosis. A rare case of the coexistence of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with the characteristic genetic changes of each has been reported.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for chronic myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to cytogenetic analysis, ESMO 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis by cytogenetic analysis showing t(9;22)(q34; q11) and by multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR showing BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Consider determining BCR-ABL1 juxtaposition by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization of blood cells, using dual color dual fusion probes to detect BCR-ABL1+ nuclei in rare cases. Obtain cytogenetic assessment to detect additional chromosome abnormalities.

Differential diagnosis

Neutrophilic leukocytosis may underlie a wide variety of diseases, both benign and malignant. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory features of CNL may overlap with these disorders. Given that an accurate diagnosis of CNL requires exclusion of a number of mimickers, it is critical to consider potentially confounding diagnoses such as reactive neutrophilia/leukemoid reaction, CML, CML-N, MPN/MDS (myeloproliferative neoplasms/myelodysplastic syndromes) overlap disorders such as aCML and CMML, as well as other myeloid neoplasms.

Distinguishing CNL from a leukemoid reaction can be challenging given that both may present with significant neutrophilia, bone marrow hypercellularity, normal cytogenetics, and absence of BCR-ABL fusion gene. WBC count may be more modestly elevated in leukemoid reaction, though there have been some reports of WBC counts up to 100 × 10 9 /L in this context. Meticulous history-taking along with a thorough clinical examination to exclude alternate diagnoses, including occult malignancy or infection, and a period of observation is often recommended before formally determining the diagnosis. The demonstration of clonality including identification of a CSF3R mutation or other molecular or cytogenetic abnormality is clearly valuable in aligning the diagnosis in favor of CNL.

CML is invariably associated with a BCR-ABL fusion gene and displays a disproportionally higher percentage of myelocytes. CML also commonly presents with basophilia, thrombocytosis, or eosinophilia. While the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome is implicit to CNL diagnosis, a rare form of CML termed neutrophilic-CML, or CML-N, has been described which shares morphological features of CNL, specifically a prominent neutrophilic proliferation. CML-N, however, is characterized by an uncommon BCR-ABL translocation which results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR-ABL messenger RNA yielding a 230-kD BCR-ABL protein (p230). The clinical correlate is a lower total WBC count, less severe anemia, less prominent splenomegaly, and blastic transformation occurring much later in CML-N patients. The attenuated phenotype and indolent course of CML-N, specifically in patients without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, is now postulated to be due to low p230 mRNA and protein levels. The diagnosis of CNL also requires that molecular testing be negative for defining markers of alternate neoplasms including not only the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene but also rearrangements in PDGFRA/B or FGFR1, characteristic of eosinophilic leukemia.

### Extramedullary sudden blast crisis in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia during first-line treatment with nilotinib [^116sGwbj]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The natural course of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has changed dramatically since the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with > 90% of the patients achieving long-term disease control. Development of resistance with progression to accelerated phase/blastic crisis (AP/BC) is observed in a limited percentage of patientsand is mainly documented in those who do not respond 'optimally' according to cytogenetic and molecular response criteria at given intervals. Rare reports of an abrupt blastic transformation defined as sudden blast crisis (SBC) have been described in chronic-phase (CP) CML patients, who had already achieved optimal response, that is, complete cytogenetic (cCgR) or even deep molecular response (MR 4 or better). Herein, we present an extremely rare case of unpredictable blastic transformation in a patient receiving nilotinib.

A 53-year-old Caucasian female patient was diagnosed with CP CML. At diagnosis, the spleen was palpable 1 cm below left costal margin, hemoglobin was 11.3 g/dl, platelet counts were normal and white blood cell counts were 105 × 10 9 /l with a left shift, 12% basophils and 5% blasts. Nested reverse transcriptase PCR from peripheral blood (PB) revealed the presence of the chimeric bcr-abl1 (β3α2 transcript), whereas bone marrow (BM) cytogenetics confirmed the presence of t(9;22)(q34; q11) translocation in all metaphases. According to Sokal index and Hasford score, the patient was classified as high risk (1.20 and 1759, respectively). However, based on the newer European Treatment and Outcome Study risk score, her disease was stratified as low risk (score < 87).

Neutrophilic BCR::ABL1 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia

A rare variant of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML has been described in which the white cell count is composed principally of mature neutrophils. In a review of 23 cases culled from the literature, there was an increased representation of females. The M:F ratio was 7:16 or 0.4:1.0 compared to a M:F ratio of 1.7:1.0 in the classical form of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML. The white cell count is lower at the time of diagnosis than is the case in most patients with classical CML (Table 3). The median white cell count was 31x10 9 /L in these 23 cases compared to mean white cell counts of 80–100x10 9 in large series of classical CML at diagnosis. However, three of the 23 patients had white cell counts of 136, 203, and 205x10 9 /L. Thus, the white cell count is markedly skewed to the low side, but not invariably. Patients with neutrophilic BCR::ABL1 -positive CML usually do not have basophilia, notable myeloid immaturity in the blood or splenomegaly. They may have thrombocytosis and, thus, their condition can mimic BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia. Indeed, an observer has suggested that this variant should not be given the special standing of neutrophilic CML; however in their rebuttal, the Italian group that has championed its special designation provides a counterargument in support of neutrophilic CML.

Workup of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — initial evaluation should include a history and physical examination, palpation of spleen, evaluation of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, cardiovascular risk factors, as well as transfusion and medication history. Laboratory evaluations should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, microscopic examination of the peripheral smear, comprehensive metabolic panel with serum uric acid, serum LDH, liver function tests, serum EPO level, and serum iron studies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients with MF for whom allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) would be considered. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on peripheral blood to detect BCR::ABL1 transcripts and exclude the diagnosis of CML is especially recommended for patients with left-shifted leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis with basophilia, and FISH may have better specificity than RT-PCR in the detection of unusual breakpoints.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^116GFMhB]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

When an atypical phenotype is present that is different from classical BCR::ABL1 -positive CML, the diagnosis may be overlooked, if there is not awareness of these atypical forms. Proper diagnosis through identification of the BCR::ABL1 oncogene is critically important because of the responsiveness of patients who carry it to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Here we review five aberrant phenotypes of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML, which in two circumstances are associated, usually, with an atypical breakpoint in the BCR gene. Among these five is smoldering BCR::ABL1 -positive CML, a rare situation in which the hemoglobin concentration, white cell count and platelet count may be normal but the patient's cells have the BCR::ABL1 oncogene and the evolution to overt and progressive chronic phase or blast crisis CML occurs months or years later.

Introduction

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders involving excessive proliferation of terminally differentiated myeloid cells of one or more lineage. The classical Philadelphia chromosome (BCR::ABL1) -negative MPNs are polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PM), which are associated with increased risk of thrombosis, systemic symptoms related to increased cytokine production such as aquagenic pruritus, risk of progression to myelofibrosis (in the case of PV and ET), and potential for leukemic transformation. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined by the BCR::ABL1 fusion protein resulting from t(9;22)(q34; q11), which is required for diagnosis according to 5 th edition WHO classifications. Other MPNs include chronic neutrophilia leukemia (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/MPN overlap neoplasms. Here, we focus on the classical BCR::ABL1 -negative MPNs.

Diagnostic work-up

When CML is diagnosed, a bone marrow aspirate is required for morphology, since the proportion of blast cells and of basophils is important to distinguish CP from accelerated phase (AP) and blastic phase (BP), and for cytogenetics. A core biopsy may be done to evaluate the degree of fibrosis which has prognostic importance and may identify nests of blasts not evident in the aspirate. Cytogenetics should be performed by CBA of Giemsa-stained metaphases from bone marrow cells. A qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR on peripheral blood cells is mandatory to identify the type of BCR-ABL1 transcripts that can be appropriately followed when assessing response to TKI therapy. About 2–4% of patients harbor atypical BCR-ABL1 transcripts lacking ABL1 exon2 (e13a3 or e14a3) or resulting from atypical BCR breakpoints (e.g. e1a2, e6a2, e8a2, or e19a2) that may yield a false negative PCR using routine primer/probe sets in qualitative or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. If not tested at diagnosis, a false impression may be given that a patient is in complete molecular response after TKI treatment. A quantitative PCR is not mandatory at diagnosis. If a molecular assay demonstrates BCR-ABL1, but the Ph-chromosome cannot be identified by cytogenetics, a FISH test is required. The diagnostic work-up is completed by a physical examination with particular reference to spleen and liver size, a standard biochemical profile including hepatitis B serology, cholesterol, lipase, and hemoglobin A1c values, and an electrocardiogram (Table 1).

Diagnostic work-up, baseline.

Performing other tests and diagnostic procedures depends on characteristics of the individual patient, medical history, and comorbidities.

The definitions of CP, AP, and BP are based on hematologic and clinical parameters and unchanged from previous published versions. However, resistance to two TKIs, detection of a BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD)-mutation, or emergence of additional chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells (ACA) raise concerns for progression of disease.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) overview — epidemiology and molecular hallmark: CML accounts for 15% of adult leukemias, with a median age of disease onset of 67 years, and in 2025 an estimated 9560 people in the United States will be diagnosed with CML and 1290 will die. CML is defined by the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)] that gives rise to a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene; in most patients the BCR breakpoint is in intron 13 or 14 and splicing almost invariably fuses ABL1 exon 2 with BCR exons 13 or 14, producing e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts encoding p210 with elevated tyrosine kinase activity.

Smoldering BCR::ABL1 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia

In 1972, a case of what was designated "preleukemic CML" was described in a patient with a normal white cell count but a low percentage of blood myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and on further study, the Ph chromosome was found in 22% of metaphase marrow cells. The patient had no significant changes in his blood counts for 5 years at which time he developed a blast crisis of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML. After a hiatus of 35 years, 14 subsequent cases were reported of similar patients, some with normal hemoglobin, white cell counts and platelet counts and in some cases very slight increases in myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the white cell differential count and occasionally a mildly elevated basophil count. These findings prompted cytogenetic and/or genetic studies that found the Ph chromosome and/or the BCR::ABL1 oncogene in a significant percentage of blood cells. The patients' disease evolved into overt BCR::ABL -positive CML months or years later. This situation has been dubbed "preleukemic" or "smoldering" CML. In a few cases, the patient had received cytotoxic therapy for lymphoma or had an alternative myeloproliferative disease (e.g. polycythemia vera) prior to the discovery of the BCR::ABL- positive blood cells. In several cases, the clues were subtle, such as an unexplained low percentage of myelocytes in the blood and a barely elevated basophil count, just exceeding normal.

Minor criteria are presence of a clonal marker or exclusion of reactive thrombocytosis. The diagnosis of ET requires either all the major criteria or the first 3 major criteria plus a minor criterion to be met.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia 2014: update on diagnosis, molecular genetics, and management [^11536kLr]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by sustained, mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and bone marrow granulocytic hyperplasia.

Diagnosis

Key diagnostic criteria include leukocytosis of > 25 × 10(9) /l (of which > 80% are neutrophils) with < 10% and < 1% circulating immature granulocytes and myeloblasts, respectively. There should be no dysplasia, monocytosis, molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGRF1 rearrangements and no identifiable cause for physiologic neutrophilia or, if present, demonstration of myeloid clonality. DEVELOPMENTS IN MOLECULAR GENETICS: Recently, CNL has been shown to be specifically driven by somatic activating mutations of CSF3R, most commonly CSF3R T618I. As such, the diagnosis of CNL will no longer be one of exclusion only, and revision of the current WHO classification is anticipated to include the molecular criterion of mutated CSF3R.

### Cryptic to conventional cytogenetics: Philadelphia-like ALL presenting with hypereosinophilia [^112mfh3u]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

BCR::ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) neoplasms lack the BCR::ABL1 translocation but have a gene expression profile like BCR::ABL1 positive B-ALL. This includes alterations in cytokine receptors and signalling genes, such as CRLF2, ABL1, ABL2, JAK2, PDGFRB and EPOR. Cases with CRLF2 rearrangements account for approximately 50% of cases of Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-like ALL), and the frequency of specific genomic lesions varies with ethnicity such that IGH::CRLF2 translocations are more common in Hispanics and Native Americans.

We report two cases of BCR::ABL1-like ALL, with significant eosinophilia. A Hispanic man in his early 20s and a Hispanic woman in her 50s presented with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. Bone marrow flow cytometry revealed lymphoblasts expressing CD19, CD10, partial CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD38, CD34, TdT and HLA-DR. Examination of the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate exhibited a hypercellular bone marrow with increased blasts and elevated eosinophils. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) demonstrated a cryptic chromosomal rearrangement between the X chromosome and chromosome 14 at breakpoints involving IGH at 14q32 and CRLF2 at Xp22.33, t(X;14)(p22.33; q32).

These findings confirmed the diagnosis of BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL with IGH::CRLF2 rearrangement. One patient (man) attained complete remission with induction therapy using the paediatric CALGB 10403 protocol, while the other patient (woman) had a poor outcome after receiving a hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone regimen. These two cases demonstrate an unusual presentation of BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL and emphasise the importance of appropriate cytogenetic studies for correct diagnosis. When treated with conventional chemotherapy, these cases carry a poor prognosis and might require allogeneic transplantation.

### Treatment of blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia: a rare and challenging entity [^111Svwr5]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a relatively rare form of myeloproliferative neoplasm, with an incidence of 0.7–1.0/100 000.CML has the hallmark genetic lesion the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, with the resultant shortened chromosome 22 being the afore‐mentioned Ph chromosome, producing the oncogenic fusion protein BCR‐ABL1, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase.

CML is a triphasic disorder. The majority of patients present in chronic phase (CP), associated with a raised white cell count, splenomegaly and, occasionally, symptoms of hyperviscosity. However, according to the EUTOS population‐based registry, 4%–5% of patients present in accelerated phase (AP); a transitional stage of disease associated with further genetic mutations, an increase in blasts and primitive cells, cytopenias and, often, treatment resistance. A further 1%–2% present in blast phase (BP; sometimes referred to as 'blast crisis') CML, a poor‐prognosis acute leukaemia, which may be myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype. In addition to presenting with de novo BP‐CML, patients may progress on therapy. With the introduction of BCR‐ABL1‐specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the rate of progression to AP or BP has fallen from 5%–20% to 1%–5% annually, with the greatest risk of progression during the first year following diagnosis. While TKIs provide excellent outcomes for patients with CP‐CML, with the majority of CP patients expected to have a normal life expectancy, responses to TKIs in BP are infrequent and of short duration, with most patients dying from refractory disease within a year of developing BP‐CML. Therefore BP‐CML continues to be a critical area of clinical need where new approaches to improve patient outcomes are urgently required.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms with peripheral blood eosinophilia (eosinophil count > 1.5 × 10⁹/L) that lack all of the aforementioned tyrosine kinase (TK) gene fusions as well as BCR::ABL1, and that show abnormal bone marrow morphology with evidence of clonality, are classified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) in the absence of another WHO-defined myeloid neoplasm, and the presence of increased blasts (5% to < 20%) can further support the diagnosis of CEL.

### Optimizing patient care in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia: a multidisciplinary approach [^117PB9Rx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome arising from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)]. This translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The product of this fusion gene, p210, a protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has significantly reduced the annual mortality rate among patients with CML. Although most of these patients respond to first-line TKI therapy, the use of TKIs is complicated by the development of resistance or intolerance in some patients, resulting in a loss of response or discontinuation of treatment. Inadequate response to TKI therapy is associated with poor long-term outcome, and the cases of patients with resistance or intolerance should be carefully evaluated for alternative treatment options. This report discusses the challenges associated with the management of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML in a patient with intolerance to multiple TKI therapies.

### An unusual case of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia with trisomy 19 presenting with megakaryoblastosis and myelofibrosis [^116GHCdE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Initial identification of chronic myelogenous leukemia is very important since targeted therapy leads to life-saving remission. Rarely, chronic myelogenous leukemia presents with an unusual picture, making the diagnosis challenging. We describe such a case of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis in a previously healthy 61-year-old woman. The patient presented with fever, myalgias, and night sweats and was first worked up for an infectious etiology. Because of persistent anemia, a bone marrow biopsy was performed that revealed fibrosis with increased megakaryoblasts. Even though initial cytogenetic studies could not be performed because of "dry tap" aspirate, persistent efforts for cytogenetic studies were made, including a "squeeze preparation" from the core biopsy, which revealed t(9;22)(q34; q11.2) and trisomy 19. The patient was treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy, and subsequently an allogeneic stem cell transplant. She is in persistent remission. This case illustrates a complex presentation of chronic myelogenous leukemia and provides an overview of morphologic cues and the importance of performing cytogenetic studies that led to the diagnosis.

### Rare case of accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosed during treatment for JAK2 V617F-positive primary myelofibrosis [^115GRPgH]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by the expansion of myeloid lineage cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are frequently associated with driver mutations in genes such as JAK2, CALR, and MPL and are mutually exclusive of BCR-ABL1. Herein, we report the first case study of a patient diagnosed with accelerated-phase CML while undergoing treatment for initial JAK2 V617F-positive, BCR-ABL1-negative PMF. This finding emphasizes the importance of BCR-ABL1 testing in patients with an atypical BCR-ABL1-negative MPN disease course.

### Does presence of complex translocations involving BCR:: ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia affect the response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors? A systematic review of the literature [^117BHEyo]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (9;22)(q34; q11) comprises 90–95% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while 5–10% of CML have translocations involving three or more chromosomes. The outcome of treating patients harbouring complex Ph-positive cytogenetics with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is unclear. In the present systematic review, we aim to summarise the response of patients with complex Ph-positive cytogenetics to treatment with TKI therapy. We collated all available literature from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science database, Cochrane library, Scopus and Embase (up until January 31st, 2024), which describe cases of patients with CML, harbouring complex Ph-positive variations (three and four-way translocations), and summarised their response to TKI therapy. The studies were screened for the following criteria: documented TKI intervention and outcome (whether CR was achieved). Studies that did not report the same, were excluded. Additionally, we report a case from our center of a 55-year-old patient with CML, positive for the Ph-chromosome, harbouring a three-way translocation involving chromosome 15 i.e. 46XX, t(9;15;22) (q34; p11; q11). Identification of BCR::ABL and involvement of chromosome 15 was carried out using conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Based on the inclusion criteria, a total of 15 studies were included from which a total of 87 cases were covered. Overall, we identified 38 unique complex three- and four-way translocations across 87 Ph-positive cases and found that 85 patients with complex Ph-positive cytogenetics achieved complete remission upon treatment and did not appear to have a lesser response to TKI therapy.

### BCR:: ABL1-positive acute myeloid leukemia [^116xARxM]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1

Morphology Update has recently discussed a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) presenting in blast crisis. For comparison, we present here a patient with BCR::ABL1 ‐positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient was a 48‐year‐old man with no known history of CML, presenting with hepatomegaly and neurological abnormalities (headaches, agitation, and behavioral disturbance). His blood count showed hemoglobin concentration 64 g/L, white cell count 457.6 × 10 9 /L, and platelet count 31 × 10 9 /L. His blood film (images × 100 objective) showed 95% blast cells; these were large, with an intermediate nuclear‐cytoplasmic ratio, irregular nuclei, sometimes nucleoli, and cytoplasm containing atypical pink to lilac granules and occasional inclusions. Promyelocytes were present but myelocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were infrequent. Neutrophils were dysplastic with hypogranular cytoplasm and abnormal nuclear forms (right image). A bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular with 84% blast cells, without prominence of eosinophils or basophils. Cytogenetic analysis showed 46, XY, t(9;22)(q34; q11)[21]. A BCR::ABL1 transcript, identified as BCR_E13::ABL1_E2, b2a2, p210, was detected on molecular analysis, together with mutations of SMC3 and WT1. In view of the molecular findings and the lack of prominent basophilia, a diagnosis of BCR::ABL1 ‐positive AML appeared most likely but post‐treatment follow‐up was needed for confirmation.

### Presentation of chronic myeloid leukemia in basophilic blast crisis [^115CuzQB]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 65‐year‐old man presented with fatigue. His spleen was just palpable below the left costal margin. His blood count showed hyperleukocytosis (WBC 242 × 10 9 /L) with blast cells predominating, hemoglobin concentration (Hb) 64 g/L, and platelet count 22 × 10 9 /L. Strikingly, the majority of blast cells had cytoplasm packed with large basophilic granules; others had more scanty granules so that the typical chromatin pattern of a blast cell was clearly evident (image, Jenner−Giemsa stain ×100 objective). The manual differential count showed 74% blast cells, 6% myelocytes, 4% neutrophils, 2% lymphocytes, and 14% mature basophils. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping on the peripheral blood sample showed around 90% weakly CD45+ blast cells, which were positive for CD13, CD33, CD117 (weak), CD34, CD38, and CD7 and were negative for CD19, CD20, CD10, cytoplasmic(c) CD79a, CD14, CD64, cCD3, HLA‐DR, and cMPO. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) on the peripheral blood sample showed a b3a2 BCR::ABL1 (p210) transcript. The bone marrow karyotype was 46, XY, t(9;22)(q34; q11.2)[16]//47, XY, idem,+i(17)(q10) [4]. The differential diagnosis at this stage was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). With financial restraints, treatment was initiated with imatinib and hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). One week later the acute phase of the disease had remitted with the features now being typical of chronic phase CML. The blood count now showed WBC 45.18 × 10 9 /L, Hb 83 g/L, neutrophils 74%, lymphocytes 3%, monocytes 4%, myelocytes 10%, and basophils (all mature) 9%. No blast cells were detected. RT‐PCR again showed a b3a2 BCR::ABL1 (p210) transcript. Cytogenetic analysis showed persistence of t(9;22), but the isochromosome 17 was no longer present. The reversion to chronic phase disease with persistence of t(9;22) and BCR::ABL1 confirmed a diagnosis of CML presenting in blast crisis rather than AML.

### Acute myeloid leukemia and other types of disease progression in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1179GWPc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This session of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology workshop focused on disease progression in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

Methods

The session included typical and unusual presentations of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1 positive; Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-neg) MPNs; and mastocytosis.

Results

Cases of CML illustrated various manifestations of progression, with emphasis on criteria defining stages of the disease. Issues were discussed related to the patterns of recurrence in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, including leukemic transformation occurring in a Ph-neg clone. Ph-neg MPN cases highlighted diagnostic approaches used to establish accelerated and blast phases, including cases with significant myelofibrosis and when an adequate bone marrow aspirate smear is not available. The session also included rare cases of aggressive mastocytosis.

Conclusions

There was agreement that a definitive diagnosis can be challenging in the absence of documented review of prior diagnostic material and clinical history.

### Somatic mutations and outcomes in chronic myeloid leukemia adolescent and young adults compared to children, adults, and BCR:: ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114eWPNf]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a translocation t(9;22)(q34; q11.2), which results in BCR::ABL1 rearrangement. Targeting the BCR::ABL1 protein with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dramatically changed outcome of CML patients. The landscape of TKI therapy has evolved with the introduction of second and third-generation TKIs that have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and a broader spectrum of BCR::ABL1 inhibition compared to their predecessors. Currently, most patients with chronic phase CML (CML-CP) achieve a normal life expectancy. Factors affecting the efficiency of TKI treatment include the availability of drugs, their tolerability, the emergence of resistance to TKIs, as well as patient compliance, comorbidities, and age-related considerations.

The incidence of CML rises with age, with the median age at diagnosis exceeding 60 years and the highest occurrence observed in individuals aged 75 and over. Prior to the integration of TKIs into clinical practice, advanced age was regarded as an adverse prognostic factor and was involved in calculation of SOKAL and Euro scores. Despite adolescents and young adults (AYAs), defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (Version 2.2024) as patients aged 15–39, accounting for 7–10% of newly diagnosed CML cases, they remain understudied.

Several clinical trials have indicated that AYA CML patients present with elevated white blood cell counts, larger spleen sizes, and lower hemoglobin levels at diagnosis compared to their older counterparts. Additionally, a higher proportion of AYA patients exhibit BCR::ABL1 transcript levels exceeding 10% on the international scale (IS) at 3 months post-TKI initiation. These indicators are reflective of the potentially aggressive nature of CML in this specific age group and underscore the unique challenges faced by AYA patients in disease management. However, studies have not consistently demonstrated lower probabilities of achieving major molecular response (MMR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) in AYA patients. Importantly, none of these studies have confirmed the impact of age on overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS). The lack of consistent evidence emphasizes the need for further research and comprehensive investigations of AYA CML patients.

### Successful kidney transplantation in a patient with pre-existing chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib [^111EcDQn]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2015, a mild but persistent left‐shifted leukocytosis occurred with a white blood cell count between 10 and 20 g/L, with 75%‐85% of neutrophils, 5%‐15% of lymphocytes, 5%‐10% of myelocytes, and 1%‐3% of metamyelocytes, and further hematological work‐up was initiated. Bone marrow examination revealed hypercellular bone marrow with a slightly increased ratio of myeloid/erythroid precursors but no elevation of blasts, consistent with a myeloproliferative disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of bone marrow revealed a novel variant translocation involving chromosome 11 in addition to chromosome 9 and 22 (46, XY, t(9;22;11)(q34; q11; q23)) with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in 8 of 20 metaphases. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of the classical BCR‐ABL transcript; thus, diagnosis of CML in chronic phase was established. No hepatosplenomegaly was present, allocating the patient to the low‐risk category according to the Sokal Score (including age, spleen size, peripheral platelet and blast count), the European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) score (including spleen size and peripheral basophil count), and the EUTOS Long‐Term Survival score (including age, spleen size, peripheral blast, and platelet count). In April 2016, treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib at 400 mg/d was initiated. Three months after treatment initiation, the patient achieved a complete hematological response (evaluated by complete blood cell and differential cell counts, and spleen size) associated with a reduction of the BCR‐ABL transcripts by 2‐log units and a complete cytogenetic remission as confirmed by the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome in bone marrow metaphases. After 6 months of therapy, a major molecular remission (ie, a 3‐log reduction of BCR‐ABL transcripts in peripheral blood), and another 3 months later a deep molecular remission (ie, an at least 4‐log reduction of BCR‐ABL transcripts in peripheral blood) were obtained and have been maintained since then (Table 1).

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia — disease assessment algorithm outlines three steps spanning extent, stage, and lineage. Step 1 addresses extent in the bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and extramedullary disease (EMD) with "Does disease involvement include BM, PB, or EMD, or all?" and includes "If clinically suspected, imaging to identify EMD". Step 2 addresses stage with "Is chronic phase or blast phase disease present in the BM or PB? If present, EMD represents a blast phase component". and includes "Staging of BM or PB to determine if chronic vs. blast phasen". Step 3 addresses lineage with "What are the disease lineage(s) of the BM or PB and EMD components?" and includes "Immunophenotyping to determine lineage in BM or PB and/or EMD".

### Variant translocation with a deletion of derivative (9q) in a case of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph +) essential thrombocythemia (ET), a variant of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with a poor prognosis [^116bV6fJ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with thrombocytosis require thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation to determine whether they suffer from essential thrombocythemia or another myeloproliferative disorder. This distinction becomes increasingly relevant as targeted agents become available to treat specific myeloproliferative diseases. Cytogenetic testing plays a major role in this analysis. This study presents a patient with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph +) thrombocytosis and a cryptic der(9q)t(5;9)t(9;22) not found by conventional cytogenetics, whose disease progressed within 2 years to typical myeloblastic crisis of CML. It discusses the entity of Ph + ET, the utility of molecular cytogenetic testing in the diagnosis of this unusual disease entity and the importance of cytogenetic testing in the prognosis of ET.

### Coexistence of inversion 16 and the Philadelphia chromosome in acute and chronic myeloid leukemias: report of six cases and review of literature [^111AgfYd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

We report 5 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 1 case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the dual presence of t(9;22) and inv(16). The 6 patients were 5 men and 1 woman with a median age of 42.5 years. All cases were BCR-ABL+ with p210 products detected in all CML cases and a p190 product detected in the AML case. An increase in bone marrow eosinophils was detected in 3 of 5 cases, and abnormal eosinophils were identified in these 3 cases. The CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion gene was confirmed in all 3 CML cases and the 1 AML case tested, and this correlated with the presence of abnormal eosinophils with coarse basophilic granules. Of 5 patients with CML, 4 had a rapid transformation to myeloid accelerated phase of blast crisis. The coexistence of t(9;22) and inv(16) in CML seems to correlate with more rapid transformation.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of new biochemical and immunohistochemical parameters in chronic myeloid leukemia [^117MUqrv]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem-cell disease characterized by multilineage expansion of clonal BCR/ABL+ cells. Transformation from chronic into accelerated and blast phase of CML is usually associated with drug resistance and is accompanied by typical clinical and/or laboratory features, such as splenomegaly, increase in precursor cells, disturbed megakaryopoiesis, basophilia or marrow fibrosis. Because of new treatment options, early recognition of disease-acceleration is of importance. In this article, we review most recent developments in diagnostic procedures employing basophil-related biochemical and histopathological markers. These tests are useful to quantitate basophil-lineage cells in the peripheral blood in CML, to determine and quantify basophilia in the bone marrow, and to detect focal accumulations of blast cells and megakaryocytes as well as increased angiogenesis and fibrosis in bone marrow sections. Application of these markers may assist in determining the phase of disease and may help to better predict the prognosis in individual patients.

### European LeukemiaNet laboratory recommendations for the diagnosis and management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^116wb6t1]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic work up and pre-treatment tests

Since 2008, CML has been defined as BCR::ABL1 positive disease only. Diagnosis of CML therefore requires the detection of the t(9;22)(q34; q11) and/or BCR::ABL1 in the appropriate clinical and laboratory setting. Cases previously considered as BCR::ABL1 -negative CML should be classified as another myeloid neoplasm depending on their hematological and molecular features.

Historically, cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow-derived cells played an essential role in the initial diagnosis of CML by direct detection of the t(9;22)(q34; q11), but many centres nowadays routinely use fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to detect juxtaposition of the BCR and ABL1 genes in interphase cells, and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect BCR::ABL1 mRNA as first line diagnostic tools in patients with a clinical suspicion of CML, with cytogenetic follow up for confirmation and detection of ACAs. Used in isolation, all three tests have limitations that need to be considered.

Cytogenetics

At presentation, up to 85–90% of CML cases have a t(9;22)(q34; q11) on cytogenetic analysis and thus have a standard Ph chromosome, sometimes described as 22q- or der22. A minimum of 20 metaphases should be analysed (ideally 25) to ensure detection of ACAs. In most patients ≥ 95% of cells are found to be Ph-positive, which reflects the marked expansion of clonal myeloid progenitor cells induced by BCR::ABL1. A bone marrow aspirate is preferred for cytogenetic analysis and can be performed on the same sample taken for morphological analysis to diagnose disease phase, but a karyotype may be successfully obtained from peripheral blood in many cases at diagnosis (but not at follow up when bone marrow is required). In 5–10% of cases the karyotype shows a variant translocation that typically involves either or both 9q34 and 22q11 plus one or more additional chromosomes. The remaining 1–5% of cases have a cryptic BCR::ABL1 fusion without any cytogenetically-visible involvement of chromosomes 9 or 22. These cases typically arise by small double recombination events that insert ABL1 into BCR and thus they cannot be diagnosed as CML by conventional cytogenetics.

### Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia found in a patient with eosinophilia for six years: a case report [^113CgBU9]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chronic and persistent eosinophilia can affect all organ systems and may even lead to life−threatening end−organ damage. Therefore, identifying the underlying cause of eosinophilia is of immense clinical significance, and appropriate therapy should be initiated promptly to minimize further end−organ damage. Clonal eosinophilia is often associated with chronic myeloid neoplasms, such as MPN or MDS/MPN. In the present case, the patient's six−year history of eosinophilia complicated the clinician's assessment, making it difficult to differentiate between symptoms of eosinophilic infiltration and immune system disorders affecting multiple organs. After ruling out the hypothesis of non−hematologic origin, testing for gene rearrangements associated with clonal eosinophilia, such as BCR::ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, PCM1::JAK2, and JAK2::V617F, did not yield any definitive clues. Conventional treatments for eosinophilia, including corticosteroids and hydroxyurea, did not significantly benefit the patient. It was not until a genomic study was performed that the patient was found to harbor concurrent ASXL1, SETBP1, and NRAS mutations, which, combined with other morphological and laboratory features, supported a definitive diagnosis of aCML.

The diagnosis of aCML should exclude other myeloid malignancies with definite genetic lesions. Its differential diagnosis includes BCR::ABL1 negative CML and other MPNs such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and chronic eosinophilic leukemia. The overlapping proliferative and developmental abnormalities observed in aCML pose challenges in distinguishing it from other MDS/MPNs such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified (MDS/MPN−NOS), a potential challenge. Among these, differentiating aCML from MDS/MPN−NOS presents the most formidable challenge, particularly in the absence of molecular features within the diagnostic criteria.

In the past, the diagnosis of aCML was mainly based on clinical morphology. However, in recent years, new insights into the molecular genetics of MDS/MPNs have significantly augmented our comprehension of aCML and shifted the focus toward the role of molecular genetics in its diagnosis. Virtually all aCML patients harbor genetic mutations affecting growth factor signaling, transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, and DNA methylation/histone modification pathways. However, owing to the inherent heterogeneity of aCML and the absence of distinct biomarkers, there is no single genetic alteration that is specific to the disease.

### Can molecular patterns help to classify overlapping entities in myeloid neoplasms? [^115kPrw2]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Myeloid neoplasms include myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms and acute myeloid leukaemia. Historically, these diseases have been diagnosed based on clinicopathological features with sometimes arbitrary thresholds that have persisted even as molecular features were gradually incorporated into their classification. As such, although current diagnostic approaches can classify the majority of myeloid neoplasms accurately using a combination of molecular and clinicopathological features, some areas of overlap persist and occasionally pose diagnostic challenges. These include overlap across BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms; between clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance and myelodysplastic neoplasms; myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms; and, detection of KIT mutations in myeloid neoplasms other than mastocytosis, raising the prospect of systemic mastocytosis. Molecular testing has become state of the art in the diagnostic work-up of myeloid neoplasms, and molecular patterns can inherently help to classify overlapping entities if considered within a framework of haematological presentations. For future development, molecular testing will likely include whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, and primarily molecular classifications of myeloid neoplasms have already been suggested. As such, genetically defined groups should still constitute the basis for our understanding of disease development from early onset to progression, while clinicopathological features could then be used to describe the stage of the disease rather than the specific type of myeloid neoplasm.

### AMN107 (nilotinib): a novel and selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL [^112TcD26]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) constitutes 15% of adult leukaemias, with approximately 4600 newly diagnosed cases per annum in the United States. The initial, chronic phase of the disease has a median duration of 4–6 years and is characterised by overproduction of immature myeloid cells and mature granulocytes in the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. Without therapeutic intervention, after a mean latency period of 4–6 years, the disease progresses via an accelerated phase, marked by the presence of primitive blast cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, and finally advances to the 'blast-crisis' phase, characterised by over 30% undifferentiated blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, and for which median survival is 18 weeks.

The BCR-ABL oncogene, which results from a reciprocal t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, encodes a chimeric BCR-ABL protein having constitutively activated Abl tyrosine kinase activity, and is the underlying cause of CML. The 210 kDa BCR-ABL protein is expressed in CML patients, whereas a 190 kDa BCR-ABL protein, resulting from an alternative breakpoint in the BCR gene, is expressed in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients.

JAK2 fusion genes

All 8 patients with JAK2 fusion genes (PCM1, n = 7; BCR, n = 1; male 7/8; median age 69 years, range 29–73) presented with leukocytosis (median 25.9 × 10 9 /l, range 10.5–55.0). Eosinophils (median 1.5 × 10 9 /l, range 0–4.6) were ≤ 0.5 × 10 9 /l, > 0.5 × 10 9 /l and > 1.5 × 10 9 /l in 2/8 (25%), 6/8 (75%) and 4/8 (50%) patients, respectively.

ETV6::ABL1 fusion gene

All ETV6::ABL1 positive patients (n = 7; male 6/7; median age 30 years, range 20–74) presented with leukocytosis > 10 × 10 9 /l (median 62 × 10 9 /l, range 20.9–143). Hypereosinophilia > 1.5 × 10 9 /l (median 5.6 × 10 9 /l, range 2.0–7.1) was observed in 7/7 (100%) cases.

Hypereosinophilia > 1.5 × 10 9 /l

Overall, hypereosinophilia > 1.5 × 10 9 /l was observed in 60/81 (74%) evaluable patients, most frequently in patients with FIP1L1::PDGFRA (40/44, 90%) and ETV6::ABL1 (7/7, 100%) fusion genes. In contrast, it was only observed in 13/30 (43%) patients with PDGFRB, FGFR1 or JAK2 fusion genes Absence of eosinophilia was restricted to 9/30 (30%) patients with PDGFRB, FGFR1 and JAK2 fusion genes (Table 5). In those 9 patients, primary diagnoses included atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (PDGFRB, n = 1; FGFR1, n = 1), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (PDGFRB, n = 1; FGFR1, n = 1), myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassified (PDGFRB, n = 2; JAK2 n = 1), myelofibrosis (JAK2, n = 1) and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (FGFR1, n = 1). In all 9 patients, the underlying fusion gene was indicated by a characteristic reciprocal translocation.

### Paraneoplastic leukemoid reactions induced by cytokine-secreting tumours [^113GGVeD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing LR from CML

In contrast to LR, CML tends to have a characteristic myelocyte peak. The absence of earlier granulocytic precursors (promyelocytes, blast), basophilia or monocytosis can be very helpful in favouring a diagnosis of LR over CML or CMML. In addition, the features of reactive granulocytosis (described above) are less frequently seen in CML and CMML. Historically, a leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score used to be a helpful tool in this setting. The LAP score tends to be low in CML and high in PLR and CNL. However, with the widely available BCR/ABL1 assays that can be done on peripheral blood, the LAP score is rarely used nowadays.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111HmBeR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — diagnosis and workup includes that initial evaluation should consist of history and physical exam with palpation of the spleen, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistry profile, and hepatitis B panel; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for morphologic and cytogenetic evaluation and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to establish quantifiable BCR::ABL1 mRNA transcripts at baseline are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of CML. Bone marrow cytogenetics with a minimum of 20 metaphases is useful to detect additional chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-positive cells; if bone marrow evaluation is not feasible, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on bone marrow or a peripheral blood specimen with dual probes for BCR and ABL1 genes can be used to confirm CML. Interphase FISH is performed on peripheral blood but can be associated with a false-positive rate of 1% to 5%; hypermetaphase FISH is more sensitive and can analyze up to 500 metaphases at a time but is applicable only to dividing cells in the bone marrow; double-fusion FISH is associated with low false-positive rates and can detect all variant translocations of the Ph-chromosome. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) should be done at the initial workup to establish quantifiable BCR::ABL1 mRNA transcripts; qPCR, usually done on peripheral blood, is the most sensitive assay available and can detect one CML cell in a background of ≥ 100,000 normal cells; results can be expressed as the ratio of BCR::ABL1 transcript numbers to control gene transcripts, and an International Scale has been established using one of three control genes.

Chronic phase CML — risk stratification — uses Sokal and Hasford (Euro) scoring systems to categorize patients into three risk groups (low, intermediate, high), with Sokal based on age, spleen size, platelet count, and peripheral blood blasts, and Euro including eosinophils and basophils; the European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival (ELTS) score is based on the same variables as the Sokol score and provides the most useful predictor of CML-related death in first-line imatinib, validated in 1120 patients across six clinical trials; older age, higher peripheral blasts, bigger spleen, and low platelet counts were associated with higher probabilities of dying, with intermediate- and high-risk groups worse than low-risk and different from each other; unlike other systems, ELTS focuses on CML-specific overall survival; determination of risk score using Sokal or Euro or ELTS prior to starting TKI therapy is recommended for CP-CML.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) — bone marrow or peripheral blood is adequate to establish the diagnosis, but bone marrow is required at diagnosis to assess for accelerated or blast phase, and when available, G-banded chromosome analysis on bone marrow is recommended. The t(9;22)(q34; q11.2) is detectable in 90% to 95% of cases at diagnosis, with the remaining 5% to 10% having a variant t(9;22) or a cryptic BCR::ABL1 fusion undetectable by G-banded analysis. The NCCN CML Guidelines recommend both G-banded chromosome analysis and quantitative RT-PCR for BCR::ABL1 fusion testing at diagnosis; if no BCR::ABL1 fusion can be detected, molecular testing for variants associated with other myeloproliferative conditions is indicated. Additional chromosome abnormalities to assess at diagnosis include an additional der(22)t(9;22), trisomy 8, i(17q), trisomy 19, complex karyotype, and abnormalities of 3q26.2, and the presence of any one of these abnormalities is indicative of progressive disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for BCR::ABL1 fusion can be performed if G-banded chromosome analysis is not possible and for monitoring atypical BCR breakpoints that preclude RT-PCR detection.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, genetics, risk stratification, and management [^116HBCPH]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) defined by persistent mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and bone marrow granulocyte hyperplasia. Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) (myelodysplastic "[MDS]/MPN with neutrophilia" per World Health Organization [WHO]) is a MDS/MPN overlap disorder featuring dysplastic neutrophilia and circulating myeloid precursors. Both manifest with frequent hepatosplenomegaly and less commonly, bleeding, with high rates of leukemic transformation and death. The 2022 revised WHO classification conserved CNL diagnostic criteria of leukocytosis ≥ 25×10 9 /L, neutrophils ≥ 80% with < 10% circulating precursors, absence of dysplasia, and presence of an activating CSF3R mutation. ICC criteria are harmonized with those of other myeloid entities, with a key distinction being lower leukocytosis threshold (≥ 13×10 9 /L) for cases CSF3R-mutated. Criteria for aCML include leukocytosis ≥ 13×10 9 /L, dysgranulopoiesis, circulating myeloid precursors ≥ 10%, and at least one cytopenia for MDS-thresholds (ICC). In both classifications ASXL1 and SETBP1 (ICC), or SETBP1 ± ETNK1 (WHO) mutations can be used to support the diagnosis. Both diseases show hypercellular bone marrow due to a granulocytic proliferation, aCML distinguished by dysplasia in granulocytes ± other lineages. Absence of monocytosis, rare/no basophilia, or eosinophilia, < 20% blasts, and exclusion of other MPN, MDS/MPN, and tyrosine kinase fusions, are mandated. Cytogenetic abnormalities are identified in ~1/3 of CNL and ~15–40% of aCML patients. The molecular signature of CNL is a driver mutation in colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor-classically T618I, documented in > 80% of cases. Atypical CML harbors a complex genomic backdrop with high rates of recurrent somatic mutations in ASXL1, SETBP1, TET2, SRSF2, EZH2, and less frequently in ETNK1. Leukemic transformation rates are ~10–25% and 30–40% for CNL and aCML, respectively. Overall survival is poor: 15–31months in CNL and 12–20months in aCML. The Mayo Clinic CNL risk model for survival stratifies patients according to platelets < 160×10 9 /L (2 points), leukocytes > 60×10 9 /L (1 point), and ASXL1 mutation (1 point); distinguishing low- (0–1 points) versus high-risk (2–4 points) categories. The Mayo Clinic aCML risk model attributes 1 point each for: age > 67years, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, and TET2 mutation, delineating low- (0–1 risk factor) and high-risk (≥ 2 risk factors) subgroups. Management is risk-driven and symptom-directed, with no current standard of care. Most commonly used agents include hydroxyurea, interferon, Janus kinase inhibitors, and hypomethylating agents, though none are disease-modifying. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative modality and should be considered in eligible patients. Recent genetic profiling has disclosed CBL, CEBPA, EZH2, NRAS, TET2, and U2AF1 to represent high-risk mutations in both entities. Actionable mutations (NRAS/KRAS, ETNK1) have also been identified, supporting novel agents targeting involved pathways. Preclinical and clinical studies evaluating new drugs (e.g., fedratinib, phase 2) and combinations are detailed.

### European recommendations and quality assurance for cytogenomic analysis of haematological neoplasms [^112Aa6N7]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

Response to treatment can be determined cytogenetically by monitoring the reduction in the number of Ph+ cells. Follow-up chromosome analysis should be performed at 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment until a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) has been achieved and at least 20 cells must be fully analysed for disease monitoring. More frequent monitoring may be required for patients in whom additional abnormalities were found at diagnosis as these may have an adverse response to TKI therapy. If a cryptic BCR-ABL1 rearrangement was detected at diagnosis then follow-up must be done by FISH or molecular methods. Once CCyR has been achieved chromosome analysis can be replaced by FISH. Accurate interpretation of FISH follow-up requires prior knowledge of the signal pattern at diagnosis, and cases with only a single fusion signal cannot reliably be monitored by FISH. If RQ-PCR methodology is standardised, and expressed according to the International Scale, then response can be assessed using only RQ-PCR. For follow-up, peripheral blood samples are more appropriate for the subsequent study of response to treatment.

Although the purpose of genetic analysis after therapy is to monitor the level of Ph+ cells, it is also recognised that new clonal abnormalities are occasionally detected in Ph− cells and these should be followed up in subsequent samples. Whilst unexpected additional abnormalities may be transient and of no clinical significance, a minority (2–10%) of these CML patients go on to develop clinically evident MDS/AML, a risk associated particularly with Ph− clones harbouring deletions of 7q or monosomy 7.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)

MPN is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by proliferation of one or more myeloid lineages. The WHO classification of MPN includes CML (covered in the previous section), chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL), polycythaemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), essential thrombocythaemia (ET), chronic eosinophilic leukaemia NOS and mastocytosis.

For many referrals of MPN, the differential diagnosis is CML and the important genetic requirement is exclusion of the BCR - ABL1 rearrangement. Mutation analysis of JAK2, CALR and MPL is particularly important in the diagnostic workup of some MPN. Currently these mutations are considered diagnostic, but may, in time, influence treatment decisions and prognosis. Cytogenetic studies are not essential and many laboratories do not offer chromosome analysis because of this lack of specificity. However, recently the karyotype has been included in the DIPSSPlus prognostic scoring systems in primary PMF and it has been suggested that it may also be a useful indicator in PMF post PV or ET.

Recommendations

Diagnosis

Our suggestions for the investigation of patients at diagnosis are largely unchanged and have been further clarified in the more detailed ELN manuscript on laboratory recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CML.

The hallmark of CML is the presence of the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene, created by the t(9;22) which gives rise to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome abnormality, and diagnosis depends on its detection or inference, by cytogenetics (conventional chromosome banding analysis (CBA) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)) and/or by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Table 1 describes the value and limitations of these methodologies. We continue to recommend morphology and CBA on bone marrow (BM) and RT-PCR on peripheral blood (PB) or BM at diagnosis, so as to accurately stage the disease, detect variant translocations, cryptic BCR::ABL1 rearrangements and additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACA) and to precisely identify the BCR::ABL1 transcript type to facilitate future monitoring of response to treatment. Some laboratories use commercial kits for RT-PCR which do not recognize all rare transcripts: discrepant results such as negative RT-PCR with positive CBA should warrant further investigation. Additional detail can be found in Cross et al.

Table 1
Recommendations for laboratory investigations at diagnosis.

BCR::ABL1 point mutations associated with resistance (hereafter called BCR::ABL1 mutations) are very rarely detected at diagnosis in chronic phase (CP) and testing is not recommended. Somatic mutations in genes other than BCR::ABL1 are found in approximately 20–30% of patients, more commonly in advanced rather than chronic phase disease. To date the therapeutic implications of these mutations remain unclear and analysis should be regarded as a valuable research tool but not a diagnostic requirement in chronic phase. In contrast, and aligning with newly diagnosed acute leukemia, targeted panel next generation sequencing (NGS) is recommended for patients presenting in or progressing to BP.

### Analytical validation of a highly sensitive, multiplexed chronic myeloid leukemia monitoring system targeting BCR-ABL1 RNA [^113qR7z5]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 1.8 newly diagnosed cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) per 100,000 individuals per year, with the median age at diagnosis of 65 years.CML accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of all adult cases of leukemia. The genetic hallmark of all cases of CML is the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, termed t(9; 22) (q34.1; q11.2), generating a fusion gene breakpoint cluster region–Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1 (BCR-ABL1) on the derivative chromosome 22 (alias the Philadelphia chromosome). Most of the translocations occur between the Major breakpoint cluster region of BCR and the intron upstream of exon 2 of ABL1. The Major breakpoint cluster region occurs downstream of either exon 13 or exon 14 of BCR and results in the formation of the Major fusion transcript e13a2 or e14a2, coding for a 210-kDa protein often referred to as p210. Major fusion transcripts (ie, p210) account for > 95% of CML cases, and patients can exhibit both species of Major BCR-ABL1 transcripts. In less than approximately 1% of CML (and two-thirds of Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia), the translocation localizes to the minor breakpoint cluster region of BCR, resulting in an e1a2 transcript that produces a 190-kDa protein. Furthermore, a 230-kDa protein is observed in rare CML cases from translocation e19a2 and is designated as the micro breakpoint. Even rarer variants have been identified, including translocations at exon 3 of ABL1. In all cases, the resulting BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is a constitutively active kinase that can drive uncontrolled proliferation in myeloid precursor cells, causing the clinical manifestation of CML.

indifferent, + positive result, - negative result, ↓ declining, ~ divergent reduction.

pCML-WP recommendation

To date, no single marker unambiguously differentiates de novo CML-BP from Ph + ALL in all cases at the time of diagnosis. In such cases, additional parameters must be obtained after therapy commences (Table 3). A high leukocyte count, left-shifted myeloid maturation, or an increased basophil or eosinophil count at diagnosis and the presence of a major transcript type are indicative, but not conclusive, in diagnosing de novo CML-BP. The panel, therefore, recommends using real-time PCR for BCR::ABL1 and IgH/TCR or flow cytometry markers (if identifiable at diagnosis) in parallel to monitor response to therapy. The accuracy of diagnosis should then be reevaluated as therapy proceeds if a divergence between the clonal markers and BCR::ABL1 transcript levels is detected. The clear detection of BCR::ABL1 in neutrophils by interphase FISH is confirmatory for CML-BP.

Where feasible, consider flow sorting to isolate myeloid versus lymphoid cells for FISH/quantitative RT-PCR studies and/or next-generation sequencing minimal residual disease to help resolve. Recognize that the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in the myeloid compartment does not necessarily imply a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia with lymphoid blast transformation.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement — diagnosis requires the presence of FIP1L1::PDGFRA gene fusion (resulting from an interstitial deletion of CHIC2 gene on chromosome 4q12) or a PDGFRA rearrangement with a variant gene fusion. If appropriate molecular analysis is not available, this diagnosis should be suspected in the presence of a Philadelphia (Ph)-negative MPN with the hematologic features of CEL associated with splenomegaly, elevation of serum tryptase, and an increased number of mast cells and/or fibrosis in the bone marrow, and MLNE with FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement has a very strong male predominance. The bone marrow is hypercellular with increased eosinophil precursors (generally without dysplasia) and proliferation of loosely distributed, interstitial CD25+ spindle-shaped mast cells may be seen, whereas KIT D816V mutation and dense clusters of mast cells typically seen in systemic mastocytosis (SM) are usually absent except in rare cases. CEL is the most common clinical presentation, and blast phase MPN, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with eosinophilia, and rarely T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL) or myeloid sarcoma have also been described; pediatric cases have also been reported.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — epidemiology and clinical features in the United States include Philadelphia chromosome-negative disorders myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The prevalence of MF, ET, and PV is estimated at approximately 13,000, 134,000, and 148,000, respectively, and in 2002–2016 data the age-adjusted IRs per 100,000 person-years were highest for PV (IR = 1.57) and ET (IR = 1.55) and was 0.44 for primary MF (PMF). MPN are characterized by a complicated symptom profile that often includes fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, and symptoms from splenomegaly, with variable laboratory abnormalities such as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and sometimes myeloid immaturity, especially in progressive MF. A SEER-Medicare analysis showed substantially inferior survival for patients with MPN compared to matched controls, with survival for patients with MF worse than that of patients with ET or PV and significantly worse than matched controls, and these diseases have propensity for disease transformation to blast phase (MPN-BP), which is akin to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis and comprehensive care of patients with MPN has evolved since identification of JAK-STAT "driver" mutations (JAK2, CALR, and MPL), and development of targeted therapies has resulted in significant improvements in disease-related symptoms and quality of life, although diagnosis, assessment of symptom burden, and selection of appropriate symptom-directed therapies continue to present challenges for hematologists and oncologists.

### Eosinophilia / hypereosinophilia in the setting of reactive and idiopathic causes, well-defined myeloid or lymphoid leukemias, or germline disorders [^114mkrdg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report the findings of the 2019 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop within the categories of reactive eosinophilia, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), germline disorders with eosinophilia (GDE), and myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia (excluding entities covered by other studies in this series).

Methods

The workshop panel reviewed 109 cases, assigned consensus diagnosis, and created diagnosis-specific sessions.

Results

The most frequent diagnosis was reactive eosinophilia (35), followed by acute leukemia (24). Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) received 17 submissions, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), MDS/MPN, and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms received 11, while GDE and HES received 12 and 11 submissions, respectively.

Conclusions

Hypereosinophilia and HES are defined by specific clinical and laboratory criteria. Eosinophilia is commonly reactive. An acute leukemic onset with eosinophilia may suggest core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia, blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia, or t(5;14) B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Eosinophilia is rare in MDS but common in MDS/MPN. CEL, NOS is a clinically aggressive MPN with eosinophilia as the dominant feature. Bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic and/or molecular clonality may distinguish CEL from HES. Molecular testing helps to better subclassify myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia and to identify patients for targeted treatments.

Features of patients with atypical BCR::ABL1 fusions

Several case reports have associated individual atypical BCR::ABL1 fusions with an unusually aggressive or benign clinical course, but these are likely subject to substantial ascertainment or publication bias. In general, atypical variants are not considered to be markers of prognosis, although systematically collected outcome data is lacking due to their rarity and exclusion from many clinical trials. An exception may be the e1a2 fusion which encodes p190 BCR::ABL1, the predominant isoform in BCR::ABL1 -positive ALL but also seen in 1% of CML cases. This isoform was originally associated with a phenotype intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and more recent data has indicated a relatively poor outcome, possibly associated with mutations in epigenetic modifiers genes. Other studies, however, have not confirmed this finding and consequently we consider that therapeutic decisions should not be influenced by BCR::ABL1 transcript type. Nevertheless, identification of cases who express an atypical BCR::ABL1 variant is required prior to treatment to enable appropriate follow up analysis.

It is important to note that the BCR::ABL1 isoform in any given patient is stable over time since it is determined by the position of the t(9;22) genomic breakpoints. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR may occasionally cause some confusion. For example, rearrangements that produce e13a2 and/or e14a2 BCR::ABL1 have the capability to generate e1a2 mRNA and other isoforms by alternative splicing (Fig. 2). Indeed, very low levels of e1a2 transcripts can be detected in most cases of CML prior to treatment but they are generally believed to be of no clinical significance, although one study did find that co-expression of p210 and p190 mRNA was associated with an adverse prognosis. Such cases should not be considered as p190 CML since the level of e1a2 expression is typically > 1000x lower than that of the predominant p210 isoform, and bone fide clonal evolution from p210 to p190 is exceedingly rare. P190 or other rare variant CML should only be diagnosed when expression of the atypical BCR::ABL1 isoform is at a level consistent with the burden of pre-treatment disease, i.e. comparable to that seen in standard e13a2/e14a2 cases. Similarly, as mentioned above, patients with atypical BCR::ABL1 fusions such as e19a2 may express low levels of e13a2 and/or e14a2 BCR::ABL1 mRNA and thus the presence of an atypical fusion may be missed.

Discriminating Ph + ALL from CML-BP lymphoid phenotype

Most children and adolescents with de novo CML-BP present with lymphoid blasts, leading to diagnostic uncertainty in discriminating that entity from Ph + ALL. Certain morphological criteria, such as increased numbers of basophils or eosinophils when patients present with less than 70% blast cells in bone marrow, could be indicative of CML-BP rather than Ph + ALL. Leukocytosis with left-shifted myeloid maturation might also point toward a diagnosis of CML-BP. Current studies have shown that pediatric patients with de novo CML-BP often present with high leukocyte counts at the time of diagnosis. The presence of the p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is likewise suggestive but has also been observed in 10–20% of Ph + ALL cases. Other molecular markers, such as IZKF1 deletions, also occur in both entities and are not solely characteristic of Ph + ALL. In most cases, a valid distinction between the entities based on morphology, immunophenotyping, molecular genetics, and transcript type at the time of diagnosis is impossible. However, indicators to better discriminate them can emerge during therapy. Typical Ph + ALL affects the lymphoid lineage only; in CML-BP lymphoid phenotype, the BCR::ABL1 rearrangement is present in both the lymphoblastic and expanded myeloid cell clones. Therefore, at the end of an ALL induction in CML-BP, a discrepancy is often observed between low minimal residual disease (MRD) as assessed by immunoglobulin G heavy chain (IgH) or T cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangement markers or flow cytometry (because of a preferential reduction in the lymphoid blast clone) and the still relatively high proportion of t(9;22) translocation–positive cells (of the still expanded BCR :: ABL1- positive hematopoiesis) in florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or transcript analysis. This discordant MRD dynamic is also described as a feature of the subset of Ph + ALL designated as CML-like disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of sorted cells does not yield reliable results because of the adverse balance between exponential amplification in PCR and the purity of the cell populations sorted from clinical samples. In principle, interphase FISH on neutrophils might expose the BCR::ABL1 rearrangement on cells of myeloid origin after a major blast reduction has occurred — for example, after two weeks of ALL-based induction treatment. The limitations of that method are a lack of universal availability of the test or the achievement of a remission that is already too deep to detect the BCR::ABL1 fusion by FISH. With respect to test availability, dried, unstained bone marrow smears stored frozen (−18 °C) can be wrapped in aluminum foil and sent to specialized laboratories. However, even with those extended diagnostic procedures (Table 3), a definitive distinction can remain elusive in some patients.

### Is trazodone effective and safe for treating insomnia?… [^111va9Qp]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary A 2018 meta-analysis examining the use of trazodone for insomnia included seven RCTs with 429 adults. Six trials took place in the outpatient setting, and one trial combined inpatients and outpatients. 1 Patients with insomnia were included regardless of whether it was primary or secondary insomnia. Primary outcomes included sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep quality. When trazodone was compared with placebo, there was no significant improvement in sleep efficiency and small to no change in sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included sleep latency, total sleep time, number of awakenings, and waking time after sleep onset. There was a significant decrease in the number of awakenings in patients receiving trazodone compared with placebo, with no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. 2 Selection criteria included an age of 18 years or older and a primary diagnosis of insomnia; patients with other comorbidities were included. Results indicated moderate improvement in subjective outcomes measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index compared with placebo. Two low-quality RCTs used polysomnography to assess sleep efficiency and found no difference. One low-quality RCT showed more adverse effects, including morning grogginess, dry mouth, and thirst, at two weeks with trazodone compared with placebo. Patients treated with trazodone had a higher risk of falls compared with zolpidem extended-release, zolpidem immediate-relief, and benzodiazepines.
