## Question

A fib with rvr in hypotensive patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in a hypotensive patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and defining instability. Then, I should verify the first-line therapy for unstable AF with RVR. Next, I will consider special scenarios like preexcitation and acute coronary syndrome. After that, I need to check what to avoid in hypotension and why. Finally, I will review post-cardioversion priorities, including anticoagulation, and summarize a practical algorithm with contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can precipitate or worsen hypotension, and the priority is to distinguish hemodynamic instability attributable to the arrhythmia from other causes like sepsis, bleeding, or pulmonary embolism, because that distinction drives whether immediate cardioversion is indicated [^6fc410d1] [^8a305e2a].

> I need to define instability carefully; hypotension alone is not enough — I should confirm signs of shock, ongoing myocardial ischemia, acute heart failure, or altered mentation attributable to the rapid AF, because guidelines recommend immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion when AF with RVR causes hemodynamic instability or ongoing ischemia, and I should not delay for drugs in that scenario [^6fc410d1] [^7cdd3d35] [^484d6133].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the first-line therapy. For unstable AF with RVR, immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice, with an initial biphasic energy of at least 200 J and escalation if needed, and I should synchronize to the R wave to avoid inducing VF; this is a Class I recommendation across contemporary AHA/ACC guidance and ALS updates [^6fc410d1] [^78614778] [^484d6133].

> Wait, let me verify special scenarios. If there is preexcitation (WPW), AV nodal blockers are contraindicated and cardioversion is indicated for instability; if there is ACS with hemodynamic compromise or ongoing ischemia, urgent cardioversion is recommended rather than attempting rate-control drugs that may worsen hypotension or ischemia, so I should not delay for pharmacologic rate control in these settings [^231ead63] [^6fc410d1] [^023b5193].

> I should double-check what to avoid in hypotension. Negative inotropes and vasodilators can worsen hypotension; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers can precipitate or worsen low blood pressure in unstable patients, and digoxin has a slow onset and limited utility in acute hypotension, so these should generally be avoided when instability is present and cardioversion is indicated [^9680a844] [^40961365].

> Let me consider pharmacologic options only if cardioversion is deferred for a compelling reason and the patient is borderline stable; in that narrow circumstance, cautious use of amiodarone may be considered for rate control in critically ill patients, but I need to remember its own hypotension risk with bolus and the potential for cardioversion with thromboembolic implications, so continuous monitoring and readiness to cardiovert are essential if the patient deteriorates [^fae56faf].

> Next, I should review post-cardioversion priorities. Once sinus rhythm is restored, I need to assess for precipitating causes of AF and hypotension, correct reversible triggers, and address anticoagulation; if AF duration is unknown or greater than 48 hours, anticoagulation should be initiated before or around the time of cardioversion unless there is a compelling contraindication, given thromboembolic risk, and I should tailor anticoagulation to stroke risk using CHA2DS2-VASc [^6fc410d1] [^9bd193a0].

> But wait, what if the patient stabilizes after cardioversion and remains hypotensive from other causes? I should confirm and treat sepsis, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, or cardiogenic shock as indicated, because restoring rhythm does not by itself correct non-arrhythmic drivers of hypotension, and ongoing instability mandates source control and hemodynamic support rather than repeated cardioversion attempts [^5225257f].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm: if the patient is unstable with hypotension attributable to AF with RVR, proceed immediately to synchronized cardioversion without delay; if the patient is stable, use guideline-directed rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers if EF is preserved, avoid these in decompensated HF or low EF, and consider amiodarone or digoxin in HFrEF or when first-line agents are contraindicated; throughout, monitor closely for hypotension and be prepared to escalate to cardioversion if instability emerges [^6fc410d1] [^114aa20a] [^8960babd] [^1cc67200].

> In summary, I should confirm hemodynamic attribution, act decisively with immediate synchronized cardioversion when instability is present, avoid negative inotropes and vasodilators that worsen hypotension, and address anticoagulation and underlying causes promptly; delays for pharmacologic rate control in truly unstable AF with RVR risk preventable deterioration and are not supported by guidelines [^6fc410d1] [^7cdd3d35] [^484d6133].

In a hypotensive patient with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response, **immediate synchronized cardioversion is the first-line therapy** [^7cdd3d35] to restore sinus rhythm and stabilize hemodynamics [^6fc410d1]. If cardioversion is not immediately available, **IV amiodarone is the preferred pharmacologic bridge** [^notfound] because it provides rate control with minimal hypotension risk compared to beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers [^notfound]. Avoid **beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin** initially, as they can worsen hypotension or delay benefit [^9680a844] [^40961365]. After cardioversion, assess for thromboembolic risk and start anticoagulation if indicated [^9bd193a0].

---

## Immediate management priorities

### Hemodynamic assessment

Assess for **shock, ischemia, or organ hypoperfusion** — including altered mental status, cold extremities, oliguria, or chest pain — to confirm that the arrhythmia is the primary driver of instability [^6fc410d1]. Continuously monitor **blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and ECG** to guide interventions and detect deterioration early [^notfound].

---

### First-line therapy: synchronized cardioversion

- **Indication**: Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated for hemodynamically unstable AF with RVR [^7cdd3d35] [^6fc410d1].

- **Energy**: Start at 200 J biphasic; escalate if needed [^78614778].

- **Sedation**: Use conscious sedation or anesthesia when feasible; do not delay life-saving cardioversion [^484d6133].

- **Anticoagulation**: If AF duration is > 48 hours or unknown, administer heparin before or immediately after cardioversion if no contraindications exist [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic alternatives if cardioversion is delayed or contraindicated

If cardioversion is delayed or contraindicated, **IV amiodarone is the preferred agent** [^3b71a091] because it provides rate control with less hypotension than beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers [^fae56faf]. Load 150 mg IV over 10 minutes, then infuse 1 mg/min for 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours; monitor closely for hypotension and bradycardia. Avoid **beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin** initially, as they can worsen hypotension or have delayed onset [^9680a844] [^40961365].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pre-excitation (WPW)**: Avoid AV nodal blockers; use procainamide or ibutilide if stable, and proceed to immediate cardioversion if unstable [^231ead63].

- **Acute coronary syndrome**: Urgent cardioversion is recommended if there is hemodynamic compromise or ongoing ischemia [^023b5193].

- **Sepsis or hypovolemia**: Treat the underlying cause concurrently while managing AF [^5225257f].

---

## Post-cardioversion management

After successful cardioversion, **assess thromboembolic risk** using CHA2DS2-VASc and initiate anticoagulation if indicated [^8a305e2a]. Identify and treat reversible triggers — such as infection, electrolyte disturbances, or ischemia — to reduce recurrence risk [^5225257f]. Continue monitoring for recurrent AF, hypotension, and complications, and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Synchronized cardioversion | Hemodynamically unstable AF with RVR | Immediate restoration of sinus rhythm and hemodynamic stability [^7cdd3d35] [^6fc410d1] |
| IV amiodarone | Delayed or contraindicated cardioversion | Rate control with minimal hypotension risk [^3b71a091] [^fae56faf] |
| Avoid beta-blockers, CCBs, digoxin | Initial management in hypotension | Risk of worsening hypotension or delayed onset [^9680a844] [^40961365] |
| Anticoagulation | AF > 48 hours or unknown duration | Thromboembolic risk reduction [^9bd193a0] |

---

In hypotensive AF with RVR, **immediate synchronized cardioversion is first-line** [^7cdd3d35]; if delayed, use IV amiodarone as a bridge [^3b71a091] and avoid agents that worsen hypotension [^9680a844]. After cardioversion, address anticoagulation and underlying causes to prevent recurrence and complications [^9bd193a0] [^5225257f].

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter — recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^ec29167e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Management of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review [^c8be0fa6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological management options for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the acute care setting.

Methods

This study was a systematic review of observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCT) of adult patients with AFRVR and concomitant ADHF in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or step-down unit. The primary effectiveness outcome was successful rate or rhythm control. Safety outcomes were adverse events, such as symptomatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 6577 unique articles were identified. Five studies met inclusion criteria: one RCT in the inpatient setting and four retrospective studies, two in the ED and the other three in the inpatient setting. In the RCT of diltiazem versus placebo, 22 patients (100%) in the treatment group had a therapeutic response compared to 0/15 (0%) in the placebo group, with no significant safety differences between the two groups. For three of the observational studies, data were limited. One observation study showed no difference between metoprolol and diltiazem for successful rate control, but worsening heart failure symptoms occurred more frequently in those receiving diltiazem compared to metoprolol (19 patients [33%] vs. 10 patients [15%], p = 0.019). A single study included electrical cardioversion (one patient exposed with failure to convert to sinus rhythm) as nonpharmacological management. The overall risk of bias for included studies ranged from serious to critical. Missing data and heterogeneity of definitions for effectiveness and safety outcomes precluded the combination of results for quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

High-level evidence to inform clinical decision making regarding effective and safe management of AFRVR in patients with ADHF in the acute care setting is lacking.

Atrial fibrillation/flutter cardioversion — indications and anticoagulation: Unstable patients or those with ongoing cardiac ischemia caused or exacerbated by atrial fibrillation/flutter require prompt cardioversion. Clinicians should consider whether the arrhythmia is causative or secondary to rapid ventricular response to guide initial pharmacologic stabilization; the hemodynamic benefits of successful cardioversion have been documented and risk of hypotension and hypoperfusion with negative inotropes has been demonstrated even in normotensive patients. Depending on the clinical scenario, patients cardioverted from atrial fibrillation/flutter of greater than 48 hours' duration are candidates for anticoagulation, and hemodynamically unstable patients and those with ongoing cardiac ischemia are likely to benefit from immediate restoration of sinus rhythm and avoidance of hypotension caused by pharmacological therapies.

### Emergency medicine updates: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^8a305e2a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

Intravenous magnesium and rate-control agents — evidence in AF with rapid ventricular response: A meta-analysis including '6 RCTs (n = 745 patients)' reported intravenous magnesium superior for rate control '(63% versus 40%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.80–3.45])' and modestly effective for rhythm conversion '(21% versus 14%; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08–2.84])' versus standard methods, with subgroup results favoring a lower dose '(≤ 5 g) (24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22–3.61])' over a higher dose '(> 5 g) (16% versus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65–2.32])' for rhythm control compared with placebo. In critically ill patients, a retrospective series 'of 38 patients' found intravenous amiodarone decreased heart rate without BP decrease versus intravenous diltiazem and digoxin, and a study of '60 critically ill patients' randomized to diltiazem 'a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours', amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus', or amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours' showed a ' > 30% rate reduction within 4 hours' was not different, with diltiazem achieving better 24-hour rate control but more hypotension requiring discontinuation. In HFrEF populations, retrospective analyses associated diltiazem with increased acute kidney injury within 48 hours when 'LVEF ≤ 50%' compared with normal EF '(10% versus 3.6%; P = 0.002)' and with a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms '(33% versus 15%; P = 0.019)', while 'Neither analysis noted an increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension'.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, choice of agents, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium in addition to standard rate control measures to achieve and maintain rate control in patients with AF with rapid ventricular response.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, choice of agents, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to administer β-blockers or nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem; provided that ejection fraction > 40%) for acute rate control in hemodynamically stable patients with AF with rapid ventricular response.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — supportive management of postoperative AF (POAF) after noncardiac surgery notes that postoperative pain, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, fluid shifts, and sepsis can contribute to new-onset POAF and a rapid ventricular response, and aggressive management of these triggers is essential. Hemodynamically stable patients with POAF may require specific therapy to achieve an optimal heart rate (< 110 bpm). Medications that block atrioventricular nodal conduction, such as beta blockers or CCBs, can be used for ventricular rate control, and digoxin can be considered as an adjunct or if other agents are contraindicated. Among patients with AF refractory to rate control with atrioventricular nodal blockers, rhythm control with synchronized electrical direct current cardioversion or pharmacological cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drugs can be considered. Exclusion of left atrial appendage thrombus before implementing rhythm control may be indicated in patients with a prolonged duration (> 48 hours) of AF or in patients at high risk for thromboembolism. Synchronized direct current cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable AF with a rapid ventricular response associated with hypotension.

Atrial fibrillation — quinidine for cardioversion: quinidine is used less frequently than other pharmacological agents, due to the perception that it is less efficacious and has more frequent side effects, although direct comparative studies are lacking. Quinidine is usually administered after digoxin or verapamil has been given to control the ventricular response rate. Potential adverse effects include QT-interval prolongation that may precede torsades de pointes, nausea, diarrhea, fever, hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. During the initiation of quinidine therapy, hypotension and acceleration of the ventricular response to AF may occur on a vagolytic basis. A clinical response may be expected 2 to 6 h after administration.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^05adf3f6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; P = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^4c050e27]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — synopsis: Treating AF/flutter with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic stability, and unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion. Stable patients can be treated pharmacologically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagulated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited AF/flutter (Wolff–Parkinson–White) is covered under Wide-Complex Tachycardias.

Acute rate control — alternatives when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated are outlined as follows: In patients with AF with rapid ventricular response in whom beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, digoxin can be considered for acute rate control, either alone or in combination with the aforementioned agents, and in patients with AF with rapid ventricular response, the addition of intravenous magnesium to standard rate-control measures is reasonable to achieve and maintain rate control.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^d608efb9]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

### Calcium chloride before I.V. diltiazem in the management of atrial fibrillation [^1a463d08]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diltiazem is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Although it is very effective for rate control, up to an 18% prevalence of reported diltiazem-induced hypotension [defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg], and a mean of 9.7% hypotension have been reported from several studies totaling over 450 patients. This hypotension may complicate therapy. Our objective was to determine if calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) pre-treatment would blunt a SBP drop after i.v. diltiazem, while allowing diltiazem to maintain its efficacy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seventy-eight patients with AFF and a ventricular rate of ≥ 120 beats per minute were enrolled. Half received i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment; the other half received placebo. All patients then received i.v. diltiazem in a standard, weight-based dose. A second dose of CaCl(2) pre-treatment or placebo and diltiazem was given if clinically indicated for additional rate control. Both CaCl(2) and placebo pre-treatment groups had equal lowering of heart rate (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events in the calcium pre-treatment study arm. One patient in the placebo group became paradoxically more tachycardic and apneic after the diltiazem infusion. Although i.v. CaCl(2) seems to be equally safe compared to placebo as a pre-treatment in the management of AFF with RVR, we were unable to find a statistically significant blunting of SBP drop with CaCl(2) i.v. pre-treatment. Until further research determines a benefit exists, we cannot recommend i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment before diltiazem in the treatment of AFF with RVR.

In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD).

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^3178884d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

IV amiodarone can be useful for rate control in critically ill adult patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response without preexcitation (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In adult patients with preexcitation atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, digoxin, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic blockers, and IV amiodarone should not be administered (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD). Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and IV β-adrenergic blockers should not be used in adult patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and decompensated heart failure because these may lead to further hemodynamic compromise (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-EO).

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

### Endocardial transcatheter stimulation of the AV nodal fat pad: stabilization of rapid ventricular rate response during atrial fibrillation in left ventricular failure [^2d03aac0]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent acute studies demonstrated that atrioventricular (AV) node vagal stimulation during atrial fibrillation (AF) decreases the mean ventricular rate, thus improving hemodynamics.

Methods and Results

We report a case of a woman with acute heart failure (HF), chronic AF with untreatable ventricular rapid response, in severe hypotensive state due to a cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent left ventricular (LV) pacemaker implantation and received 50 Hz AV node stimulation, delivered through a posteroseptal atrial lead, thus allowing a 100% pacing. Hemodynamics improvements allowed carvedilol titration; the rate was below 85 bpm after 4 days, then the atrial lead was removed.

Conclusions

This novel strategy may allow controlling the rapid AV response in patients undergoing pacemaker implantation.

### Evaluation of diltiazem dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1e91b23f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

Atrial fibrillation — short-term and long-term treatment goals: For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be anticoagulation and rate control, while the long-term goal is to restore sinus rhythm. When cardioversion is contemplated and the duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, patients who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from short-term anticoagulation. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening HF, making the establishment of sinus rhythm a combined short- and long-term therapeutic goal. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term therapy may be necessary.

### Efficacy of intravenous magnesium for the management of non-post operative atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f035e3db]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium (IV Mg), a commonly utilized therapeutic agent in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, is thought to exert its influence via its effect on cellular automaticity and prolongation of atrial and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness thus reducing ventricular rate. We sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard pharmacotherapy in the rate and rhythm control of AF in the nonpostoperative patient cohort given that randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard of care were identified via electronic database searches. Nine RCTs were returned with a total of 1048 patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were study-defined rate control and rhythm control/reversion to sinus rhythm. The secondary endpoint was patient experienced side effects.

Results

Our analysis found IV Mg in addition to standard care was successful in achieving rate control (odd ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–3.11, p = .02) and rhythm control (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04–2.03, p = .03). Although not well reported among studies, there was no significant difference between groups regarding the likelihood of experiencing side effects.

Conclusions

IV Mg, in addition to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, increases the rates of successful rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative patients with AF with rapid ventricular response and is well tolerated.

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^049bcfa9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^f64ecc55]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^f97d3bb0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure — rate control pharmacotherapy: In RATE-AF, 160 patients (≥ 60 years) with persistent AF and HF (81% with LVEF ≥ 50%) were randomized to digoxin or bisoprolol; there was no significant difference in the primary QOL endpoint at 6 months, secondary outcomes (including natriuretic peptides) were lower with digoxin, resting heart rate did not differ at 12 months, and adverse effects were less common with digoxin. Post hoc analyses in HF on chronic digoxin associated serum digoxin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL with increased mortality and hospitalization, whereas levels < 0.8 ng/mL were associated with the lowest mortality rate. In DAAF, among 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin significantly decreased heart rate at 2 hours versus placebo. In critically ill patients, a randomized trial of 60 patients (13 with HF) showed significant rate control with both intravenous diltiazem and amiodarone, with a higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation with diltiazem; a retrospective intensive care unit series of 38 patients (9 with HF) found intravenous amiodarone lowered ventricular rate without BP decrease compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. The text cautions that intravenous beta blockers may cause hypotension in hemodynamic instability, that intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension (especially with bolus), and that the possibility of conversion to sinus rhythm and thromboembolism should factor into risk–benefit decisions when choosing intravenous amiodarone for rate control.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^c940f894]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^d3f0ad66]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias

There is fairly uniform practice with respect to managing cardiac arrhythmias with serious arrhythmias being uncommon. Sinus tachycardia is to be expected and a new baseline acceptable heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is generally recorded in the standing orders along with a directive against the use of beta blockers. The rate typically increases after each IL-2 dose, peaks at 2–4 hours and returns to baseline prior to the next dose. It is a compensatory response to hypotension, but is also a consequence of secondary cytokine and stress related epinephrine release and fever. It is important to distinguish the cause in order to avoid unnecessary fluid boluses. The tachycardia seems to become more pronounced and prolonged with an increased number of doses. It usually resolves over time between doses and is back to baseline before the next dose. Some centers extend the time between doses to allow recovery and others hold a dose until the next scheduled administration time.

Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are not a contraindication to continued IL-2 dosing, but if the frequency increases (above 10/min), or patterns such as quadrigeminy or couplets or greater arise, holding IL-2 doses until recovery may be necessary. Less common cardiac arrhythmias requiring immediate intervention include supraventricular tachycardia with rapid response, atrial fibrillation with rapid response, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients may continue IL-2, if SVT or atrial fibrillation are converted/controlled, sinus rhythm is maintained or heart rate is controlled and there are no signs of cardiac damage. Ventricular tachycardia requires evaluation for cardiac damage and is an absolute contraindication to more IL-2. Rarely, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis is noted clinically or on an EKG. This may reflect lymphocytic infiltration. If concerns exist regarding myocarditis or ischemia, then cardiac enzymes or troponin should be monitored at least daily and IL-2 discontinued if confirmed.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^b8ebcbf0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Reducing diltiazem-related hypotension in atrial fibrillation: role of pretreatment intravenous calcium [^205109a1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9% placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.

Results

The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9bd193a0]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — basis for cardioversion indicates that cardioversion may be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF, may be immediate when the arrhythmia is the main factor responsible for acute heart failure, hypotension, or worsening angina in coronary artery disease, and carries a risk of thromboembolism unless anticoagulation prophylaxis is initiated before the procedure, with risk greatest when the arrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 h.

### Verapamil hci [^0c7e3741]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including:

- Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to Verapamil administration.

- Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the U.S., about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in heart rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after Verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. The effect of a single injection lasts for 30–60 minutes when conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur.

Because a small fraction (< 1.0%) of patients treated with Verapamil hydrochloride respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation with an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole — see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, an office setting may be acceptable.

Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after intravenous Verapamil.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^e00c7745]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and syncope — In patients with AF, GDMT is recommended and listed as "I C-EO". AF can be associated with syncope, but as with other forms of SVT, syncope from a rapid ventricular response (in the absence of preexcitation) is relatively unusual. Patients with chronic AF merit control of the ventricular response or maintenance of sinus rhythm with appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy (in carefully selected patients). Patients with paroxysmal AF are predisposed to an abnormal neural response during both sinus rhythm and arrhythmia, and the onset of AF may trigger vasovagal syncope (VVS). In patients with sinus node dysfunction, syncope could occur upon termination of AF when prolonged pauses are present.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^6fe6de7a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^5474a69b]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), systemic thromboembolism, and mortality. It is seen in 10% to 45% of patients with congestive HF at initial presentation. Its presence in HF patients is associated with worse prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality. Frequently, cause-effect relationship cannot be established at the time of presentation, as persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can lead to HF, and on the contrary, severe HF can be complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.

In atrial fibrillation, the relationship between ventricular rate and congestive HF is complex. Optimal management of HF, through neuro-hormonal influences, decreases sympathetic activity and thus slows ventricular rate. Slowing ventricular rate by atrioventricular blockade leads to improved ventricular filling and cardiac output. In individual patients, it is very difficult to establish which of the above is more critical; however, controlling ventricular rate is intuitive and is associated with improvement in HF. The optimal ventricular rate that is associated with the best long-term outcome remains a matter of debate.

### Atrial fibrillation in the ICU [^343e1fcb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.

Preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) — acute and longer-term management: During an acute episode of preexcited AF with rapid ventricular response and hemodynamic instability, electrical cardioversion must be used to restore sinus rhythm. Pathway ablation has well-established efficacy and safety for those with preexcited AF with a high success rate (93%-95%), and electrophysiological study and accessory pathway (AP) ablation can be offered as first-line therapy. Pharmacological options that increase the refractory period of atrial tissue (ibutilide or procainamide) can slow AP conduction and terminate AF; in 1 study involving 22 patients, ibutilide terminated AF in 21 patients and prolonged refractoriness of the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, and AP, and hemodynamically stable patients with preexcited AF can be pharmacologically managed with such agents. Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents can increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) by accelerating AP conduction; in a study of patients with WPW given verapamil during electrophysiological study, 2 patients deteriorated and required cardioversion, and because other safer options are readily available, atrioventricular nodal agents are best avoided in this setting.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation — treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^264febd4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^937bba46]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Intravenous Verapamil HCI is indicated for the following:

Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to verapamil hydrochloride administration.
Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the United States, about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous verapamil. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in ventricular rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after verapamil and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. Slowing of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter lasts 30 to 60 minutes after a single injection.

Because a small fraction (< 1%) of patients treated with verapamil respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate In atrial flutter/fibrillation and an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole - see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous verapamil should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after intravenous verapamil.

Atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — recommendations: In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and quality of life. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequate back-up pacing leads before performing ablation. In patients with AF with normal ejection fraction undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area may be reasonable.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia — High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

Atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) with preexcitation syndromes — Conduction over an accessory pathway during AF can cause dangerously rapid ventricular responses and, in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation with risk of death; intravenous digitalis, verapamil, or diltiazem do not block the accessory pathway and may accelerate ventricular rate, and "these agents are contraindicated in this situation", while "caution should be exercised" with beta blockers in AF associated with preexcitation.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

### Analysis of current management of atrial fibrillation in the acute setting: GEFAUR-1 study [^f72cac46]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Limited information relative to the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department (ED) daily practice is available. This study evaluates current management of atrial fibrillation in this setting to identify areas for practice improvement.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter observational study carried out in 12 EDs. Adults in whom atrial fibrillation was demonstrated in an ECG obtained in the ED were included. Clinical variables and atrial fibrillation management in the ED were prospectively collected by the treating physicians using a standardized questionnaire. Patients with rapid ventricular response (> 100 beats/min) were considered eligible for rate control, and patients with recent-onset episodes (< 48 hours) were eligible for rhythm control.

Results

Of 1,178 patients, 41% presented with a rapid ventricular response and 21% had recent-onset episodes. Rhythm control was attempted in 42% of eligible patients, with antiarrhythmic drugs in 88% of cases (I-C drugs in 44% of patients; amiodarone in 43% of patients). Overall effectiveness of pharmacologic cardioversion was 63% (amiodarone 54.5%, flecainide 93%), whereas electrocardioversion was effective in 87.5% of cases. Rate control was performed in 68.3% of eligible patients (overall effectiveness 47.8%); digoxin was used in 67% of cases (effectiveness 45%). Both strategies were selected in 4.5% of cases, whereas no treatment for atrial fibrillation was performed in 60% of patients.

Conclusion

In our ED population, rate-control effectiveness is poor and rhythm control is not attempted in most recent-onset episodes. Methods to improve rate-control effectiveness, the selection of patients for rhythm control, and the use of electrocardioversion appear warranted.

Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) — key recommendations are as follows: In patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm. In patients with AF who are hemodynamically stable, electrical cardioversion can be performed as an initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion, energy delivery should be synchronized to the QRS to reduce the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). For elective electrical cardioversion in AF, use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as initial energy can be beneficial to improve success of the initial electrical shock. When AF duration is longer or the initial shock is unsuccessful during elective cardioversion, optimization of electrode vector, use of higher energy, and pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can facilitate success. In patients with obesity and AF, manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy may be beneficial to improve success of electrical cardioversion.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with concomitant heart failure [^2efb3dd0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is acutely treated with intravenous push (IVP) metoprolol (MET) or diltiazem (DIL). In heart failure (HF) patients, diltiazem is not recommended due to negative inotropic effects. Studies comparing the treatment of atrial fibrillation often exclude HF. Hirschy et al. evaluated HF patients with concomitant Afib with RVR who received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem to determine their effectiveness and safety. They found similar safety and effectiveness outcomes between the two groups.

Methods

This retrospective, IRB-approved study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency center (EC) with Afib with RVR and HF from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2021. Included patients were 18 years of age or older, received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem in the EC, and had a recorded baseline ejection fraction (EF). The primary effectiveness outcome was successful heart rate (HR) control 30 min after treatment with either IVP metoprolol or diltiazem, which was defined as HR < 100 beats per minute (bpm). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included HR control 60 min post-IVP and at EC discharge or transfer and HR reduction > 20% at 30 min after IVP, 60 min after IVP, and at time of discharge or transfer. Other secondary outcomes included the time to adequate HR control, the total dose of IVP metoprolol or diltiazem given, any additional rate-controlling agents given, and crossover between metoprolol and diltiazem. Safety outcomes included bradycardia, hypotension, shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements, change in EF, acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Of 2580 evaluated, 193 patients were included (134 DIL vs. 59 MET) with age 73.3 ± 12.2 years, 63% female. The average EF was 48.2 ± 14.2% and 30% of patients had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while 64% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effective heart rate control 30 min post-IVP was not different between the two groups (55% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.063). DIL effectively controlled HR quicker than MET (13 [9, 125] DIL vs. 27 [5, 50] MET, min, p = 0.009). DIL resulted in greater HR reductions at 30 min (33.2 ± 25.4 DIL vs. 19.7 ± 19.7 MET, bpm, p < 0.001) and at 60 min (31 ± 23.5 DIL vs. 19.6 ± 19.1 MET, bpm, p = 0.002). DIL also more frequently resulted in a HR reduction of 20% or greater at 30 min (63% DIL vs. 27% MET, p < 0.001), 60 min post-IVP (59% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.019), and at time of patient discharge or transfer from the EC (70% DIL vs. 49% MET, p = 0.005). No differences in safety outcomes were identified.

Conclusion

Acute management of patients with Afib with RVR and HF is challenging. While successful rate control at 30 min was not significantly different between diltiazem and metoprolol, IVP diltiazem reduced HR more quickly and reduced HR by 20% or greater more frequently than IVP metoprolol with no safety outcome differences. Further studies are needed to evaluate diltiazem's safety in patients with Afib and HF.

### Clinical assessment of clonidine in the treatment of new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^7aa25cdc]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of digoxin and verapamil in the control of ventricular response in rapid atrial fibrillation is well established. This study investigates how clonidine compares with these standard therapies in rate control for new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation. We set out to test the hypothesis that clonidine effectively reduces heart rate in patients with new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation.

Subjects and Methods

Forty patients were seen in the emergency department with new-onset (≤ 24 hours' duration), stable, rapid atrial fibrillation. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either clonidine, digoxin, or verapamil. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure over 6 hours, as well as frequency of conversion to sinus rhythm were recorded and analyzed.

Results

The mean reduction in heart rate over 6 hours was 44.4 beats/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4–60.4 beats/min) in the clonidine group, 52.1 beats/min (95% CI 40.8–63.4 beats/min) in the digoxin group, and 41.8 beats/min (95% CI 22.5–61.0 beats/min) in the verapamil group. Analysis of variance of the heart rate changes in the 3 groups after 6 hours was not significant (P = 0.55). At 6 hours, 7 of 12 clonidine patients, 8 of 15 digoxin patients, and 7 of 13 verapamil patients remained in atrial fibrillation (P = 0.962 on chi(2)).

Conclusion

Clonidine controls ventricular rate in new-onset atrial fibrillation with an efficacy comparable to that of standard agents.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias in chronic heart failure — The course of patients with HF is frequently complicated by supraventricular tachyarrhythmias; the most common treatable atrial arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which affects 10% to 30% of patients with chronic HF and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and worse long-term prognosis. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may exert adverse effects by 4 different mechanisms, including loss of atrial enhancement of ventricular filling with compromised output, rapid heart rate increasing demand and decreasing coronary perfusion, diminished contraction and relaxation with rapid ventricular response, and stasis in fibrillating atria predisposing to emboli. In most patients with an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the rapidity of ventricular response is more important than the loss of atrial support, because restoration of sinus rhythm does not result in predictable clinical benefits, and rapid supraventricular arrhythmias may actually cause or exacerbate a cardiomyopathy.

### Impact of intravenous calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation / flutter in the emergency department [^dabd5095]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of early intravenous (IV) calcium on systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered with IV diltiazem in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that evaluated adults admitted to the ED with documented AF or AFL, heart rate (HR) > 120 bpm, SBP 90 to 140 mmHg, and received treatment with IV diltiazem for rate control. The primary outcome was the change in SBP 60 min (± 30 min) after initial IV diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control (HR < 100 bpm), time to sustained rate control (HR < 100 bpm for 3 h), change in HR, rates of hypotension, bradycardia, hypercalcemia, and line extravasation within 24 h of initial diltiazem administration.

Results

There were 198 subjects in the diltiazem monotherapy group and 56 subjects in the diltiazem with calcium group meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, median change in SBP 60 min after initial IV diltiazem administration, was similar between groups (-2 mmHg vs -1.5 mmHg; p = 0.642), but this difference was not statistically significant. All secondary outcomes were found to be similar between groups. Although not statistically significant, hypotension occurred more often in the diltiazem with calcium group (20.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.060) while bradycardia occurred more often in the diltiazem monotherapy group (4.5% vs 0%; p = 0.213). In terms of achieving rate control, the administration of calcium with diltiazem did not significantly change the time to initial rate control (1.4 h vs 1.8 h; p = 0.141) or time to sustained rate control (7.9 h vs 7.7 h; p = 0.570) compared to diltiazem alone.

Conclusions

In the setting of AF/AFL with RVR, administration of IV calcium with IV diltiazem did not show a significant impact on clinical or safety outcomes compared to IV diltiazem monotherapy.

### Difficult airway management in a patient with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, rapid atrial fibrillation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension: a case report [^20791043]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, encountering difficult airways in this patient population is quite common. The challenge for anesthesiologists lies not only in establishing the airway but also in managing the hemodynamic instability caused by sympathetic activation during intubation. The purpose of this report is to describe the anesthetic experience of this patient with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and moderate pulmonary hypertension with an anticipated difficult airway.

Case Presentation

This case report describes intubation with fibreoptic bronchoscopy after the induction of general anesthesia in a cardiac surgical patient diagnosed with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, rapid atrial fibrillation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension who underwent mitral and tricuspid valve replacements. The patient had a history of difficult intubation. Therefore, having considered that the benefits of intubation after general anesthesia induction outweighed the risks of awake intubation, the choice of fibreoptic bronchoscopy-guided intubation was performed following general anesthesia induction. No adverse events occurred throughout the proceeding.

Conclusion

This case highlights the importance of considering both airway safety and maintaining hemodynamic stability when cardiac surgery patients encounter an anticipated difficult airway. Awake intubation is not the only option, and intubation after general anesthesia may be considered when the benefits are evaluated to outweigh the risks.

### Perioperative patients with hemodynamic instability: consensus recommendations of the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation [^a44cd257]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The Importance of Technology

Because intraoperative hypotension is multifactorial, an accurate assessment of the underlying etiology of hypotension will allow for cause-directed therapy. However, the use of "standard" intraoperative monitors alone in many cases renders blood pressure management mainly reactive. More advanced monitoring technology designed to predict hemodynamic instability before it occurs may contribute to our ability to prevent hemodynamic instability. Patient decompensation using a combination of the patient's physiological data using artificial intelligence continues to advance. Hypotension prediction from live physiological arterial waveforms has also been successful. Ideally, the sequence of events should be to predict deterioration, and treat the underlying cause with a preemptive intervention before clinical hemodynamic instability throughout all phases of care.

Selecting the most appropriate technology is challenging. Continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring has been US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and evidence suggests that it may offer a method of detecting hypotension earlier than traditional monitoring. Similarly, portable finger cuff-based pulse decomposition analysis technology is validated as a source of continuous cardiac output information and should allow for enhanced noninvasive monitoring during transitions to a lower level of patient care. Other technology that has similarly utilized morphology of the electrocardiogram, heart rate variability, and blood pressure to predict critical response events in low-acuity units and new-onset atrial fibrillation is available.

Novel biological sensors are currently undergoing investigation. Although there are many challenges to validating and incorporating new hemodynamic parameters into clinical practice and the decision matrix for hemodynamic instability, they show great promise at measuring indices such as fluid responsiveness, autonomic functions, vascular compliance, tissue metabolism, and microcirculatory parameters. Measuring these variables may refine not only the detection of hemodynamic instability but also guide therapeutic interventions.

While monitoring effectively is essential, the information needs to be delivered to providers in a concise and useful manner to guide clinical care as well as research and quality improvement. Achieving this will require integration of live physiological data and patient-specific factors like comorbidities and perioperative status with more complex alerting systems. The control tower model with integration into the EMR may prove a way of delivering this capability in a cost-effective manner.

New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported following LEXISCAN injection [see Adverse Reactions (6–6.2)].

5.4 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria and rashes have occurred. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in fewer than 1 percent of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available.

5.5 Hypotension

Adenosine receptor agonists, including LEXISCAN, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 minutes of LEXISCAN administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In post-marketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6–6.2)].
