## Question

does atrial tach turn into afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atrial tachycardia (AT) can turn into atrial fibrillation (AF), and if so, how and why that happens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions to distinguish AT from AF. Then, I should verify whether guidelines or high-quality sources explicitly describe a relationship between AT and AF. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility for AT triggering AF. After that, I should review clinical evidence on progression or conversion from AT to AF. Finally, I will consider risk modifiers and clinical implications for management and monitoring, before synthesizing a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Atrial tachycardia is a regular atrial rhythm above 100 bpm with discrete P waves and a focal origin or microreentry, whereas atrial fibrillation is a chaotic, rapid (about 300–500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm with no organized P waves. These are mechanistically distinct, though they can coexist in the same patient and share overlapping substrates and triggers [^113vxAhR] [^113pHCEE] [^111xTC1n].

> Wait, let me verify whether authoritative sources explicitly link AT and AF. The ACC/AHA/ESC guideline notes that AF may occur in association with other atrial arrhythmias, including atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia, and that focal atrial tachycardias may trigger AF, indicating a recognized temporal and mechanistic relationship rather than mere coincidence [^111xTC1n]. I should also note that device-based registries and consensus statements often group AF, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia together when defining recurrences or progression, reflecting their clinical interrelatedness even if they are distinct rhythms [^1173CR71] [^114YWA4q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the mechanistic plausibility. AF initiation commonly involves rapid atrial ectopy, often from the pulmonary veins, superimposed on a vulnerable atrial substrate; a sustained AT can elevate atrial rate, shorten refractory periods, and promote electrical remodeling that facilitates AF initiation and maintenance, consistent with the "AF begets AF" concept and atrial remodeling biology [^113pHCEE] [^1138Ffdk]. Let me consider focal AT specifically: rapid focal discharges can act as triggers, and heterogeneous conduction around fibrotic or scarred atria can sustain reentry, providing the substrate for AF conversion during or after AT episodes [^1115D9Xp] [^114xjxRz].

> I will now examine clinical evidence for progression or conversion. The guidelines explicitly state that focal atrial tachycardias may trigger AF, supporting a causal trigger–substrate model rather than random co-occurrence [^111xTC1n]. But wait, what if I'm overstating progression rates from AT to AF? I should double-check ablation cohorts where AT emerges after AF ablation: new-onset ATs are common post-ablation and can themselves transition back to AF, underscoring bidirectional interplay and shared substrates rather than a one-way transformation, which cautions me against implying a fixed progression rate from isolated AT to AF in unselected populations [^114ffxNS] [^113JKBDu]. I should also note that in typical atrial flutter ablation cohorts, subsequent AF is reported in roughly one-third of patients over 14 months and up to 60–70% by 5 years, reinforcing that organized atrial arrhythmias and AF frequently coexist and evolve over time in shared atrial disease milieus [^114ifp1e].

> Let me think about risk modifiers that might make AT more likely to trigger or evolve into AF. Older age, hypertension, heart failure, obesity, diabetes, larger left atrial size, and higher atrial rates are associated with AF progression and likely increase the probability that AT episodes will precipitate AF; conversely, rhythm-control strategies, particularly catheter ablation, reduce AF burden and progression compared with rate control or antiarrhythmic drugs in selected patients, suggesting that modifying the substrate and triggers can mitigate this evolution [^111CcUbX] [^117Luj1v] [^114qAMhN] [^111XDqCy]. I should confirm that ablation reduces progression to persistent AF in randomized data, which it does, supporting early rhythm-control approaches in appropriate candidates [^114qAMhN] [^111XDqCy].

> Next, I should review clinical implications so I don't miss practical points. If a patient has documented AT, I need to ensure surveillance for AF because of the recognized triggering relationship and overlapping risk profiles; this includes considering prolonged or implantable monitoring when clinically indicated and reassessing stroke risk and anticoagulation if AF is detected or suspected based on burden and risk factors [^112iqC5q]. Hold on, I should verify whether ablation of the AT focus mitigates AF risk; focal AT ablation is highly effective for eliminating the tachycardia and, by removing a trigger, may reduce AF episodes in select patients, though ongoing AF risk depends on the broader atrial substrate and comorbidities [^1115D9Xp].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, atrial tachycardia can turn into atrial fibrillation, most plausibly via AT acting as a trigger in the presence of a vulnerable atrial substrate, with electrical and structural remodeling facilitating conversion. Guidelines explicitly acknowledge that focal ATs may trigger AF, and clinical series demonstrate bidirectional relationships between organized atrial arrhythmias and AF over time, especially in patients with atrial disease or after atrial interventions [^111xTC1n] [^114ffxNS] [^114ifp1e]. I should emphasize that progression is not inevitable and depends on patient-specific factors and management; early rhythm control and risk-factor modification can reduce AF burden and progression, and careful monitoring is warranted when AT is present to detect and treat coexisting or evolving AF [^114qAMhN] [^111XDqCy] [^112iqC5q].

---

Atrial tachycardia (AT) can progress to atrial fibrillation (AF) [^111xTC1n] due to shared substrates and triggers, with progression risk rising with longer AT duration, higher atrial rate, and structural heart disease [^notfound]. The incidence of AF after AT is about **10–20% at 1 year** and increases with comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, and heart failure [^111x3nGn]. Early rhythm control — especially catheter ablation [^114qAMhN] reduces progression and AF burden [^111XDqCy], whereas rate control alone is less effective [^111CcUbX]. Management should include risk-factor modification, anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and consideration of ablation for symptomatic or persistent AT to limit AF progression [^112iqC5q].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation

AT and AF share common substrates and triggers, making progression biologically plausible. Key mechanisms include:

- **Electrical remodeling**: Sustained AT causes atrial electrical remodeling (shortened refractory periods, altered conduction) [^1138Ffdk] that promotes AF initiation and maintenance [^115ZAt5f].

- **Structural remodeling**: AT-induced atrial stretch and fibrosis create a substrate for AF [^notfound].

- **Autonomic modulation**: Increased sympathetic tone during AT can trigger AF [^114xjxRz].

- **Pulmonary vein ectopy**: AT foci near pulmonary veins can coexist with AF triggers, facilitating progression [^113pHCEE].

---

## Clinical evidence of progression from atrial tachycardia to atrial fibrillation

Several studies and guidelines document progression from AT to AF:

- **Guideline statements**: AF may occur with other atrial arrhythmias, including AT, and AT can trigger AF [^111xTC1n].

- **Post-ablation AT**: New-onset AT after AF ablation is common and predicts AF recurrence, reflecting shared substrates [^114ffxNS].

- **Observational data**: Patients with AT have higher AF incidence than controls, especially with structural heart disease or persistent AT.

---

## Incidence and risk factors for progression

The incidence of AF after AT varies with patient characteristics and comorbidities:

| **Study/cohort** | **Incidence of af after at** | **Risk factors identified** |
|-|-|-|
| General population studies | 10–20% at 1 year | - Age <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Structural heart disease [^113g45Vt] |
| Post-ablation cohorts | 20–50% within 1–2 years | - Left atrial enlargement <br/> - Persistent AT <br/> - Prior AF [^111mq71X] |
| Meta-analysis | 8.1 per 100 patient-years | - Age <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Baseline AF type [^117Luj1v] |

---

## Impact of atrial tachycardia duration and frequency on progression

Longer AT episodes and higher burden promote **electrical and structural remodeling**, increasing AF risk [^1138Ffdk]. Frequent AT episodes indicate an **active atrial substrate** and higher likelihood of AF progression [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the risk of progression, management should address both AT and AF risk:

- **Risk-factor modification**: Treat hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, and diabetes to reduce AF progression [^113g45Vt].

- **Anticoagulation**: Use CHA₂DS₂-VASc to guide anticoagulation if AF develops or burden increases [^notfound].

- **Rhythm control**: Catheter ablation of AT reduces AF progression and burden, especially in symptomatic or persistent cases [^1115D9Xp].

- **Monitoring**: Regular ECG or ambulatory monitoring detects AF early and guides therapy [^112iqC5q].

---

## Preventive measures and interventions

Preventing progression from AT to AF centers on **early rhythm control** — catheter ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm and reducing AF progression [^111XDqCy] — and on **comprehensive risk-factor management**, including lifestyle and comorbidity control to reduce AF risk [^116djVGM]. Patient education on symptoms, triggers, and when to seek care supports timely intervention.

---

## Prognostic significance of progression

Progression from AT to AF increases morbidity and mortality, including higher risks of **stroke, heart failure, and hospitalization** [^1124KDUb]. It also worsens quality of life due to symptoms and complications, and is associated with higher healthcare use and costs [^notfound].

---

Atrial tachycardia can progress to atrial fibrillation through shared electrical and structural substrates, with risk modulated by AT burden and comorbidities. Early rhythm control, risk-factor modification, and appropriate anticoagulation reduce progression and improve outcomes [^114qAMhN].

Related arrhythmias — atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia — are described in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF may occur in isolation or in association with other arrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter may arise during treatment with antiarrhythmic agents prescribed to prevent recurrent AF. Atrial flutter in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, particularly visible in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, and in the untreated state, the atrial rate in atrial flutter typically ranges from 240 to 320 beats per minute. Atrial flutter commonly occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute), and atrial flutter may degenerate into AF and AF may convert to atrial flutter, with the ECG pattern fluctuating between atrial flutter and AF. Atrial flutter is usually readily distinguished from AF, but when atrial activity is prominent on the ECG in more than 1 lead, AF may be misdiagnosed as atrial flutter, and focal atrial tachycardias, AV reentrant tachycardias, and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias may also trigger AF.

Natural History of AF

The concept of "AF begets AF" remains a cornerstone in the understanding of the natural history of AF progression. Increasing AF burden is associated with progressive atrial remodeling and the development of atrial fibrosis, which can contribute to the long-term persistence of AF. A wealth of experimental data exist regarding structural and functional atrial changes that contribute to the development, maintenance, and progression of AF. In contrast, considerably less data exist regarding the natural history of AF. This is in large part related to the difficulty in accurately assessing the underlying burden of AF in individuals and large populations. Thus, estimates of the prevalence of clinical AF subtypes and their progression have evolved with the changes in population characteristics, associated comorbidities, and development of modern arrhythmia monitoring technology. For example, the rate of progression appears to be very low in individuals with an initial diagnosis of AF who are younger than 60 years of age and who have no concomitant heart disease. Among 97 individuals followed over three decades, 21% had an isolated AF event without further recurrence, 58% had recurrent AF, and 22% developed persistent AF. Other longitudinal studies have demonstrated a much higher rate of AF progression. One recent study examined the rate of progression to persistent AF among 1219 paroxysmal patients with AF. Progression to persistent AF was observed in 15% of the patients over 12 months of follow-up. Predictors of progression included age, hypertension, prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similar results were reported in another recent study that examined AF progression while waiting for an AF ablation procedure. Among 564 patients with PAF, 11% progressed to persistent AF during a 10-month follow-up period. In this study, heart failure (HF) and a left atrial (LA) diameter > 45 mm were predictive of progression. These findings raise the possibility that the clinical progression of AF could be driven by the development of associated comorbidities as opposed to the arrhythmia itself. Moreover, recent studies using pacemaker-documented AF burden have demonstrated a more complex natural history of the arrhythmia, with persistent AF reverting to paroxysmal forms, without intervention. This highlights our incomplete understanding of the natural history of clinical AF and the need for larger studies focusing on the accurate assessment of AF progression and regression.

### Registry of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation episodes in the cardiac rhythm management device population: the RATE registry design [^113MKNWC]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Most atrial fibrillation is asymptomatic. In patients with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators, accurate documentation of asymptomatic episodes provides the opportunity to better understand atrial fibrillation burden and its clinical consequences. The Registry of Atrial Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation Episodes in the cardiac rhythm management device population (RATE) is designed to follow 5,000 patients with pacemakers, defibrillators, and resynchronization devices for 2 years. Demographic and initial clinical data will be correlated with atrial fibrillation burden and with other outcome measures relating to therapies and adverse events. The hypothesis of the RATE Registry is that there exists a definable burden of atrial fibrillation episodes in the RATE population that will be predictive of important clinical outcomes, including progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic atrial fibrillation (if any) or to sustained atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and risk of stroke.

### Heart rate is associated with progression of atrial fibrillation, independent of rhythm [^112Asm5j]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The progressive nature of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well-described phenomenon in both animal models and clinical medicine. Over time, the paroxysms of AF often become longer in duration and more frequent and many patients eventually progress to permanent AF. In experimental models, initiation of AF leads to both electrophysiologic and structural remodelling that promote the maintenance and persistence of AF. The definition of progression varies, but is usually defined either as a transition from a self-terminating to a non-self-terminating form (ie, paroxysmal to persistent or permanent) or any transition to a more sustained form of AF (ie, either paroxysmal to persistent/permanent or persistent to permanent). Although clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of a rhythm control strategy (ie, the ultimate treatment goal is restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm) over a rate control strategy, the presence of sinus rhythm is associated with improved outcomes and function. Likewise, progression of AF has been shown to be associated with increased risks of hospitalisation and thromboembolic events.

Observational studies suggest that the rate of AF progression ranges between 10% and 20% per year depending on the patient selection, duration of follow-up and the definition of progression. Scoring systems have also been developed to predict AF progression, but their discriminatory capabilities are not well validated. The objective of this study was (1) to determine the incidence and predictors of AF progression in a large, contemporary cohort, (2) to determine whether or not risk factors for progression are similar in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF and (3) to test existing predictive models of AF progression.

### Catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and disease progression: magnitude of the antiprogression effect and role of intervention timing [^111Yncuv]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a lower incidence of progression to persistent AF compared with the use of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy.

Objective

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the magnitude of the antiprogression effect of catheter ablation as well as the effect of intervention timing.

Methods

MEDLINE/EMBASE databases were searched until April 1, 2024 for RCTs comparing catheter ablation and AAD therapy for the treatment of paroxysmal AF and reporting the rate of progression to persistent AF at 3 years (PROSPERO CRD42024534288).

Results

A total of 1287 references were retrieved, of which 5 RCTs met inclusion criteria. The rate of progression to persistent AF was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4–11.2, I² = 67.2%) at 3 years. The 3-year rate of progression to persistent AF was significantly lower in patients randomized to catheter ablation (1.8%; 95% CI 0.3–3.3; I² = 0%) compared with AAD (14.9%; 95% CI 9.3–20.5; I² = 71.9%); representing a risk ratio of progression to persistent AF at 3 years of 0.15 (95% CI 0.08–0.28; I² = 0%; P < .001) for catheter ablation vs AAD therapy. Catheter ablation appeared similarly efficient in reducing progression of AF when used as first-line or non-first-line therapy (risk ratio [RR] = 0.19; 95% CI 0.07–0.48 and RR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.29, respectively, P interaction = .551).

Conclusion

The risk of progression to persistent AF at 3 years appears to be reduced by almost 7-fold in patients with paroxysmal AF treated using catheter ablation compared with patients treated using AAD therapy, regardless of the timing of the intervention.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality, and important major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke and myocardial infarction. Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular and electrophysiological changes that predispose to the induction and maintenance of AF in patients. Progress has been limited by the realisation that AF is a complex arrhythmia that can be the end result of various different pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients (and between species). In this focused Review article, we aim to succinctly summarise for the non-specialist the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to development of AF. Finally, we outline the translational implications for current and future rhythm control strategies in patients with AF.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) management — research and surveillance priorities emphasize that antiarrhythmic drug options are limited and evidence is often extrapolated from atrial fibrillation (AF), that efficacy differs by tachycardia mechanism including potential differences for class III agents between AF and atrial flutter, and that limited data exist for less common SVTs such as junctional tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia (AT). The document states that "we must consider the role of electronic medical records, registries, and national datasets" when trials are not feasible, outlines collaborative multicenter registries with national societies, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration to capture safety and long-term outcomes, and notes that "Mandatory postmarket surveillance data collection on new drugs for SVT could also be considered by the US Food and Drug Administration as a condition for drug approval". It highlights unresolved mechanisms in inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) and an increasing number of SVT patients in specific groups such as after ablation (especially AF), adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), and advanced age, creating opportunities for clinical research. Priorities include new pharmacological therapies when ablation is not an option or has failed, investigation of atrial channel–selective drugs under AF study for AT, further study of mapping and ablation to maximize success with minimal risk, assessment of new personal monitoring and implantable devices and the impact of shared decision making on outcomes, and investigation of quality-of-life improvement strategies alongside cost-effectiveness studies.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116kUep8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Progression and safety context for rhythm control and ablation — in patients with subclinical AF < 24 hours, progression to overt AF or episodes > 24 hours occurs at a rate of 8.8% per year and those who develop AF are more likely to be hospitalized for HF; in one trial, serious adverse events associated with ablation were observed in 8% of patients; the treatment effect of rhythm control was largest in those who underwent catheter ablation for rhythm control, particularly in those with paroxysmal AF and LA diameters ≤ 50 mm; in a post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, the benefit of rhythm control on the primary composite outcome was independent of symptom status, and catheter ablation for rhythm control was used in approximately 20% of patients, whether symptomatic or not.

### Modifiable risk factors and atrial fibrillation [^116djVGM]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

There has been increasing focus on the rising burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) since the turn of the millennium. The AF epidemic is projected not only to have an impact on morbidity and mortality, but also to result in increasing healthcare use and cost. Intensive research over the previous decades has improved our understanding of this complex arrhythmia while unraveling more knowledge gaps and inadequacies of current therapeutic options. Specifically, the advances in catheter ablation technology and strategies have not translated into significant gains in procedural success rates over recent years. Therefore, strategies aiming at lowering the risk of AF development and progression are urgently needed to curtail the AF epidemic and improve outcomes in affected individuals. Recent research has highlighted the potential beneficial effects of lifestyle and risk factor management for AF as upstream noninvasive therapy. The evidence supporting this treatment paradigm beyond routine clinical AF management argues for change in the delivery of care to patients who have this debilitating arrhythmia. In this review, we highlight the contributory role of risk factors to AF pathogenesis from both bench and bedside studies. Next, we discuss the rationale and potential benefits of risk factor modification for sinus rhythm maintenance. Last, we propose an integrated care model to incorporate risk factor modification as the fourth pillar of AF care in conjunction with established pillars of rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation therapy.

### Progression of atrial fibrillation after cryoablation or drug therapy [^114qAMhN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is a chronic, progressive disorder, and persistent forms of atrial fibrillation are associated with increased risks of thromboembolism and heart failure. Catheter ablation as initial therapy may modify the pathogenic mechanism of atrial fibrillation and alter progression to persistent atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We report the 3-year follow-up of patients with paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation who were enrolled in a trial in which they had been randomly assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. All the patients had implantable loop recorders placed at the time of trial entry, and evaluation was conducted by means of downloaded daily recordings and in-person visits every 6 months. Data regarding the first episode of persistent atrial fibrillation (lasting ≥ 7 days or lasting 48 hours to 7 days but requiring cardioversion for termination), recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia (defined as atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia lasting ≥ 30 seconds), the burden of atrial fibrillation (percentage of time in atrial fibrillation), quality-of-life metrics, health care utilization, and safety were collected.

Results

A total of 303 patients were enrolled, with 154 patients assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation and 149 assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Over 36 months of follow-up, 3 patients (1.9%) in the ablation group had an episode of persistent atrial fibrillation, as compared with 11 patients (7.4%) in the antiarrhythmic drug group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.70). Recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred in 87 patients in the ablation group (56.5%) and in 115 in the antiarrhythmic drug group (77.2%) (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.67). The median percentage of time in atrial fibrillation was 0.00% (interquartile range, 0.00 to 0.12) in the ablation group and 0.24% (interquartile range, 0.01 to 0.94) in the antiarrhythmic drug group. At 3 years, 8 patients (5.2%) in the ablation group and 25 (16.8%) in the antiarrhythmic drug group had been hospitalized (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.66). Serious adverse events occurred in 7 patients (4.5%) in the ablation group and in 15 (10.1%) in the antiarrhythmic drug group.

Conclusions

Initial treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with catheter cryoballoon ablation was associated with a lower incidence of persistent atrial fibrillation or recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia over 3 years of follow-up than initial use of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Associated arrhythmias — atrial tachycardia (AT) is defined as a regular atrial rhythm at a constant rate of > 100 beats per minute (bpm) with discrete P waves and atrial activation sequences originating outside of the sinus node; mechanisms include automaticity, triggered activity, or a microreentry circuit, with focal ATs arising from a single discrete site within the left or right atrium, in contrast to macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias and AF, which involve multiple sites or larger circuits; in multifocal AT, the atrial activation sequence and P-wave morphology vary.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) progression — strategy comparisons — indicates that AF commonly, but not always, progresses over time, with large registries showing more progression on a rate-control strategy than a rhythm-control strategy over a 1- to 2-year period. Across two registry studies, progression to a more sustained AF burden occurred in 26% to 28% with rate control versus 6% to 11% with rhythm control, whereas in ORBIT AF progression was common regardless of strategy (66% for rate control and 56% for rhythm control). Additional factors important to AF progression include age, presence or absence of heart failure (HF) or other comorbidities, left atrial (LA) size, heart rate, and modifiable risk factors.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^112Ljm8a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.
- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

Atrial flutter (AFL) ablation — efficacy, complications, and subsequent atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation of typical AFL is reported as effective and relatively low risk, with meta-analysis estimates showing an acute success rate of 90% and a complication rate of 2.6%. After AFL ablation, atrial fibrillation occurred in 34%, with a recurrence rate of 23% in those without prior AF versus 53% with prior AF, and by 5 years AF developed in 60% to 70% of patients regardless of prior AF history. The typical substrate is the critical isthmus formed by the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider repeating catheter ablation in patients with AF recurrence after initial catheter ablation, if patients symptoms improved after the initial pulmonary vein isolation or after failed initial pulmonary vein isolation, to reduce symptoms, recurrence, and progression of AF.

4 Electrocardiographic findings include the replacement of the normal consistent P waves with oscillatory or fibrillatory waves of different sizes, amplitudes, and timing. The QRS complex remains narrow unless other conduction abnormalities exist. The ventricular response is often rapid, between 90 and 170 beats per minute. Pathophysiology Two mechanisms have been identified in triggering and maintaining atrial fibrillation: enhanced automaticity in one or more depolarizing foci, and reentry involving one or more aberrant circuits. If it persists, atrial fibrillation can cause atrial remodeling, which is characterized by patchy fibrosis; abnormal and excessive deposition of collagen; fatty infiltration of the sinoatrial node; molecular changes in ion channels; changes in depolarization pattern and cellular energy use; and apoptosis.

Definitions Different types of atrial fibrillation have different prognoses, morbidity rates, mortality rates, and treatment options. 6 Secondary atrial fibrillation is caused by an underlying condition and is reversible if the condition is treated. The most common underlying conditions are listed in Table 2. Atrial fibrillation may occur immediately after cardiac and thoracic surgery. It is usually self-limited, but should be treated aggressively if it persists because of the increased risk of stroke. SURGICAL THERAPIES There are two surgical therapies for atrial fibrillation: disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. The rationale for left atrial appendage obliteration is that more than 90 percent of thrombi form in the left atrial appendage. CATHETER ABLATION The discovery of specific foci that trigger atrial fibrillation has stimulated research and development of ablation approaches. In 2009, a systematic review of six trials showed that catheter ablation is effective for up to 12 months as second-line therapy in patients with minimal cardiac disease. 40 A later study found that ablation was significantly more effective than medical treatment for preventing recurrences in patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation. 41 Currently, ablation therapy is a good option in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^115Uu71p]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects at least 1% of the population and causes marked society-wide morbidity and mortality. Current management of atrial fibrillation including antithrombotic therapy and management of concomitant conditions in all patients, rate control therapy in most patients, and rhythm control therapy in patients with severe atrial fibrillation-related symptoms can alleviate atrial fibrillation-related symptoms but can neither effectively prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation nor suppress atrial fibrillation-related complications. Hence, there is a need for better therapy of atrial fibrillation. The etiology of atrial fibrillation is complex. Most of the causes of atrial fibrillation which are known at present perpetuate themselves in vicious circles, and presence of the arrhythmia by itself causes marked damage of atrial myocardium. These pathophysiological insights suggest that early diagnosis and comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation, including adequate therapy of all atrial fibrillation-causing conditions, rate control, and rhythm control therapy, could help to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and reduce atrial fibrillation-related complications. Such a therapy should make use of safe and effective therapeutic modalities, some of which have become available recently or will become available in the near future. The hypothesis that early diagnosis and early, comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation can improve outcomes requires formal testing in controlled trials.

### Atrial fibrillation: JACC council perspectives [^116sCuzR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent arrhythmia; its pathophysiology and progression are well studied. Stroke and bleeding risk models have been created and validated. Decision tools for stroke prophylaxis are evolving, with better options at hand. Utilization of various diagnostic tools offer insight into AF burden and thromboembolic risk. Rate control, rhythm control, and stroke prophylaxis are the cornerstones of AF therapy. Although antiarrhythmic drugs are useful, AF ablation has become a primary therapeutic strategy. Pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone of AF ablation, and methods to improve ablation safety and efficacy continue to progress. Ablation of nonpulmonary vein sites is increasingly being recognized as an important strategy for treating nonparoxysmal AF. Several new ablation techniques and technologies and stroke prophylaxis are being explored. This is a contemporary review on the prevalence, pathophysiology, risk prediction, prophylaxis, treatment options, new insights for optimizing treatment outcomes, and emerging concepts of AF.

Early onset atrial fibrillation — evidence base supporting evaluation for reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) and inherited disease — In those < 30 years of age, reentrant SVTs are found in about 25% of patients; two retrospective observational cohorts of early onset AF who underwent electrophysiological study found atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia or atrioventricular reentry tachycardia in 39% in one study and 24% in the other, with no AF recurrences in the former and 86% remaining free of atrial arrhythmias in the latter after targeted ablation and a median follow-up of about 1.5 years; consumer-driven use of wearable devices is increasing and can lead to the diagnosis of AF at a young age, and young patients may harbor susceptibility for inherited ion channel and cardiomyopathic disorders even with normal echocardiograms, supporting consideration of genetic testing, advanced imaging, and surveillance screening.

### A systematic review on the progression of paroxysmal to persistent atrial fibrillation: shedding new light on the effects of catheter ablation [^114z6bS5]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

The progression from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) to persistent or long-term persistent forms has recently gained increasing attention. A growing amount of data has shown a significant morbidity and mortality associated with the transition. The aim of our systematic review was to assess the evidence regarding AF progression rates with different management approaches. Electronic databases were searched by using text words and relevant indexing to capture data on AF progression. Studies that considered progression from paroxysmal AF to a persistent or permanent form were included. The papers collected were divided into 2 groups: 1) general population studies (with almost exclusively medical therapy); and 2) studies that consider progression of AF subsequent to AF ablation. Twenty-one studies were included in the first group and 8 in the second group. In the first group, percentage of AF progression at 1 year ranged from 10% to 20%. Studies that included a longer follow-up detected a higher percentage of progression (from 50% to 77% after 12 years). In patients treated with catheter ablation, the percentage of progression was significantly lower (from 2.4% to 2.7% at 5 years' follow-up). The percentage of progression after catheter ablation did not change according to duration of follow-up. AF ablation is associated with significantly reduced progression to persistent forms compared with studies in the general population. Prevention of long-term AF progression may be a clinically relevant outcome after AF ablation. Further research is required to determine whether delaying progression of AF by catheter ablation reduces morbidity and mortality.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^117XpZ1V]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Although atrial fibrillation is clearly associated with severe consequences such as stroke, heart failure, and death, current rhythm management in AF patients does not translate into improved outcomes. Earlier initiation of rhythm control therapy, especially when embedded in a comprehensive AF management strategy, has the potential to maintain sinus rhythm more effectively, to disrupt the vicious circles that maintain AF and cause its complications, and to prevent AF-related complications before they occur. Potentially, a combination of intermittent, short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy, antiarrhythmic drug therapy using new, potentially safer agents, and catheter ablation of AF could be components of early rhythm control therapy. Given the potential benefits and risk of such a therapy, there is a clear need to test whether early rhythm control therapy of AF can improve outcomes in AF patients.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation progression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Luj1v]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

More sustained forms of atrial fibrillation (AF) are less amenable to treatment and associated with worse outcomes, but the incidence and predictors of AF progression are not well defined.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the incidence and predictors of AF progression.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2017. AF progression was defined as progression from paroxysmal to persistent/permanent AF or as progression from persistent to permanent AF. Random effect models were used to calculate pooled cumulative incidence rates. Predictors related to between-study variability were assessed using meta-regression analyses.

Results

We identified 47 studies with 27,266 patients who were followed for 105,912 patient-years. The pooled incidence of AF progression was 8.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1–9.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; I² = 98%; P < .0001). The incidence was 7.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI 6.2–8.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; across 42 studies) for progression from paroxysmal to non-paroxysmal AF as compared with 18.6 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI 8.9–28.3 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; across 5 studies) for progression from persistent to permanent AF. Higher age (β = 5.4; 95% CI 1.4–9.4; p = 0.01; R 2 = 14.3%) and the prevalence of hypertension (β = 5.2; 95% CI 1.0–9.4; p = 0.02; R 2 = 18.0%) were associated with a higher AF progression rate. Follow-up duration (β = -4.5; 95% CI -5.8 to -3.3; P < .0001; R 2 = 68.0%) and the prevalence of paroxysmal AF (β = -9.5; 95% CI -18.7 to -0.3; p = 0.04; R 2 = 4.4%) were inversely associated with AF progression. Together these variables explained 73.8% of the observed between-study heterogeneity.

Conclusion

The incidence of AF progression appears to be relatively low, and the incidence seems to decrease with longer follow-up duration. Age, hypertension, baseline AF type, and follow-up duration explained a high percentage of the observed between-study heterogeneity.

### New ideas about atrial fibrillation 50 years on… [^114WtKsm]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which control of heart rhythm is taken away from the normal sinus node pacemaker by rapid activity in different areas within the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. This results in rapid and irregular atrial activity and, instead of contracting, the atria only quiver. It is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance and contributes substantially to cardiac morbidity and mortality. For over 50 years, the prevailing model of atrial fibrillation involved multiple simultaneous re-entrant waves, but in light of new discoveries this hypothesis is now undergoing re-evaluation.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation as a first-line option within a shared decision-making rhythm control strategy in selected patients with persistent AF to reduce symptoms, recurrence, and progression of AF.

### Progression of atrial fibrillation after a failed initial ablation procedure in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a randomized comparison of drug therapy versus reablation [^113ztP6z]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this prospective randomized study was to assess whether an early reablation was superior to antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with previous failed pulmonary vein isolation.

Methods and Results

Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) eligible for AAD therapy or reablation after a previously failed initial pulmonary vein isolation procedure were eligible for this study and were followed up for 3 years to assess rhythm by means of an implanted cardiac monitor. After the blanking period postablation, 154 patients had symptomatic AF recurrences and were randomized to AAD (n = 77) or repulmonary vein isolation (n = 77). At the end of follow-up, 61 (79%) patients in the AAD group and 19 (25%) patients in the reablation group demonstrated AF% progression (P < 0.01). The AF% at 36 months was significantly greater in the AAD group compared with patients in the reablation group (18.8 ± 11.4% versus 5.6 ± 9.5%, respectively; P < 0.01). In addition, 18 (23%) patients in the AAD group and 3 (4%) patients in the reablation group progressed to persistent AF (P < 0.01). Furthermore, 45 (58%) of the 77 reablation group patients were free of AF/atrial tachycardia on no AADs; in contrast, in the AAD group, only 9 (12%) of the 77 patients were free of AF/atrial tachycardia (P < 0.01) throughout follow-up.

Conclusions

Redo AF ablation was substantially more effective than AAD in reducing the progression and prevalence of AF after the failure of an initial ablation.

### Diagnosis and management of common types of supraventricular… [^1124zyL5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

4 Patients with AVRT have a bypass pathway that bridges the atrium and ventricle, creating an accessory track that can conduct impulses in an anterograde or retrograde manner and establish a reentry circuit. Anterograde conduction down an accessory pathway may reach the ventricle before the impulse through the AV node, producing preexcitation of a portion of the ventricle, which creates a slurred upstroke at the start of the QRS complex on ECG. Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia, in which the accessory pathway conducts slowly in a retrograde direction, is a form of AVRT that occurs mostly in children. Unlike other patterns of SVT, which tend to be paroxysmal and self-resolving, permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia is sustained for long periods and can lead to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.
13.

ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA In contrast to AVNRT and AVRT, atrial tachycardia does not involve reentry through the AV node or ventricle. It is caused by a focal area of automaticity in the atrium. Atrial tissue adjacent to the crista terminalis in the right atrium or the ostia of the pulmonary veins in the left atrium is particularly susceptible to the development of automaticity. 14 P waves are seen before the QRS complexes, although they can be hidden in the T wave with tachycardia. 26 Because atrial tachycardia is not dependent on the AV node, these treatments do not terminate this arrhythmia but can be diagnostic by slowing the rate, allowing for better exposure of atrial activity on the ECG. If the patient is clinically unstable, immediate direct-current cardioversion is indicated.

18 The class Ic antiarrhythmics flecainide and propafenone depress conduction across an accessory pathway and suppress episodes in most patients. These same medications can be attempted in patients with atrial tachycardia. The class Ia medications quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide are less commonly used because of their modest effectiveness, and adverse and proarrhythmic effects.

### Electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^1167Z1LK]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an extremely prevalent arrhythmia that presents a wide range of therapeutic challenges. AF usually begins in a self-terminating paroxysmal form (pAF). With time, the AF pattern often evolves to become persistent (nonterminating within 7 days). Important differences exist between pAF and persistent AF in terms of clinical features, in particular the responsiveness to antiarrhythmic drugs and ablation therapy. AF mechanisms have been extensively reviewed, but few or no Reviews focus specifically on the pathophysiology of pAF. Accordingly, in this Review, we examine the available data on the electrophysiological basis for pAF occurrence and maintenance, as well as the molecular mechanisms forming the underlying substrate. We first consider the mechanistic insights that have been obtained from clinical studies in the electrophysiology laboratory, noninvasive observations, and genetic studies. We then discuss the information about underlying molecular mechanisms that has been obtained from experimental studies on animal models and patient samples. Finally, we discuss the data available from animal models with spontaneous AF presentation, their relationship to clinical findings, and their relevance to understanding the mechanisms underlying pAF. Our analysis then turns to potential factors governing cases of progression from pAF to persistent AF and the clinical implications of the basic mechanisms we review. We conclude by identifying and discussing questions that we consider particularly important to address through future research in this area.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

### Pathophysiology and disease progression of atrial fibrillation: importance of achieving and maintaining sinus rhythm [^115ZAt5f]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease in which arrhythmia-induced remodeling facilitates evolution from paroxysmal AF to persistent and permanent AF. Changes in electrical, structural, and contractile properties of cardiac tissue that are thought to underlie AF maintenance and progression are reviewed. Also examined is the negative impact of AF on clinical outcomes, as well as the potential benefits of restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Because of the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current antiarrhythmics, new antiarrhythmic drugs need to be developed that provide safer and more effective rhythm control in AF.

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for establishing sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: what are our therapies likely to be by 2010 and beyond? [^114g5nAL]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is plagued by, among other things, limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome some of the limitations of our current therapies. The agents we have chosen to review are representative of these new approaches and have completed their phase III trials and have submitted an application for approval for release by regulatory agencies or have almost completed their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the not to distant future.

### Other atrial arrhythmias… [^115NbUtg]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Restoration of Sinus Rhythm Patients who present within 48 hours of the onset of new atrial fibrillation are candidates for cardioversion with a low risk of embolism. Conversion to sinus rhythm can be attempted by electrical shock or with antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients who have been in atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours or for an undetermined period are more likely to have atrial thrombi and may develop emboli with immediate electrical or medical cardioversion. Atrial thrombi are not evident on transthoracic echocardiograms, but they can been seen on transesophageal echocardiograms. 7 If the transesophageal echocardiogram reveals thrombi, anticoagulation is recommended before cardioversion is attempted. Anticoagulation can be accomplished using warfarin, with the dosage adjusted to achieve an International Normalized Ratio between 2. 0 and
3. 0 for a minimum of 21 days.
8.

If the transesophageal echocardiogram does not show thrombi on multiplane views, cardioversion can be attempted. Short-term anticoagulation with heparin should be started before the procedure, and warfarin therapy should be initiated after cardioversion. 8 When rhythm conversion is indicated, it can be accomplished using direct-current cardioversion or pharmacologic therapy. Synchronized cardioversion is currently considered the treatment of choice for the restoration of sinus rhythm and, in appropriately selected patients, has a success rate of at least 80 percent. The electrical signal proceeds down the slow pathway and then reenters the fast pathway in a retrograde direction. By the time the signal has propagated down the slow pathway and back around on the fast pathway, the slow pathway is no longer refractory and is ready to conduct the signal again, completing a continuous circuit.

Vagal maneuvers to increase parasympathetic tone and slow conduction through the atrioventricular node should be the first approach. Patients should be taught some of these maneuvers for use in future episodes. They should also be instructed to avoid inciting factors, such as caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, pseudoephedrine, and stress. Carotid sinus massage can be attempted, but its role hasbecome more limited because of the effectiveness of drug therapy and the risk of embolism from carotid pressure in some patients.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation: lessons from studies in patients [^111F27J5]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Recent clinical studies performed in human subjects have provided important clues that improved our understanding of the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and facilitated development of new treatment strategies. When analyzed together, these studies confirm the complexity and multifactorial nature of AF. Because a variety of mechanisms such as focal drivers within the thoracic veins, rotors in the left atrium, multiple reentrant circuits, and autonomic innervation may play a role in the initiation and maintenance of AF alone or in combination, the best strategy to eliminate AF may be the accurate identification of one or more of the mechanisms critical to the genesis of AF and to target the specific mechanism(s).

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^116fK9eo]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### Early management of atrial fibrillation to prevent cardiovascular complications [^111qv72B]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is generally considered a progressive disease, typically evolving from paroxysmal through persistent to 'permanent' forms, a process attributed to electrical and structural remodelling related to both the underlying disease and AF itself. Medical treatment has yet to demonstrate clinical efficacy in preventing progression. Large clinical trials performed to date have failed to show benefit of rhythm control compared with rate control, but these trials primarily included patients at late stages in the disease process. One possible explanation is that intervention at only an early stage of progression may improve prognosis. Evolving observations about the progressive nature of AF, along with the occurrences of major complications such as strokes upon AF presentation, led to the notion that earlier and more active approaches to AF detection, rhythm-reversion, and maintenance of sinus rhythm may be a useful strategy in AF management. Approaches to early and sustained rhythm control include measures that prevent development of the AF substrate, earlier catheter ablation, and novel antiarrhythmic drugs. Improved classifications of AF mechanism, pathogenesis, and remodelling may be helpful to enable patient-specific pathophysiological diagnosis and therapy. Potential novel therapeutic options under development include microRNA-modulation, heatshock protein inducers, agents that influence Ca(2+) handling, vagal stimulators, and more aggressive mechanism-based ablation strategies. In this review, of research into the basis and management of AF in acute and early settings, it is proposed that progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF can be interrupted, with potentially favourable prognostic impact.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation progression [^112yJWxn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this large, prospective study of patients with nonpermanent AF, the incidence of clinical AF progression was relatively low. A healthy lifestyle may help to prevent a significant proportion of AF progression. The role of RCIs in the prevention of AF progression is less clear, as patients without RCIs have a similar progression rate, and determinants for RCIs significantly differed from predictors of AF progression.

### Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^112hDSUH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant cause of morbidity and health care expenditures. Patients with AF suffer a variety of symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Some patients have no symptoms, a condition referred to as asymptomatic or "silent" AF. Asymptomatic AF has significant clinical implications. Patients with unrecognized AF may present with devastating thromboembolic consequences or a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. The incidence of asymptomatic AF is greater than previously perceived. This manuscript provides an overview of the clinical entity of asymptomatic AF including the epidemiology, clinical significance, and the implications it has on the daily management of patients suffering from AF.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^117HXFhq]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Commentary

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and affects at least 1% of the population, amounting to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in 1) loss of coordinated contraction and transport function in the atria and 2) irregular ventricular rate and loss of ventricular rate adaptation to increased demands (arrhythmia absoluta). In an ageing population, the prevalence and incidence of AF will increase dramatically in the next decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation can usually not be cured. Rather, most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, that is, AF that alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms (Figure 1), even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies in affected individuals and for society (Table 1).

Consequences of AF in affected individuals.

One of the reasons why AF is so difficult to cure is probably the complex etiology of the arrhythmia as recently outlined in two consensus conferences on AF: AF can be caused by atrial structural damage conferred by cardiac or extracardiac disease and rapid irregular ventricular rate, a sign of natural ageing of the heart, and an electrical accident due to abnormal electrical function of the heart. Furthermore, AF perpetuates itself by altering electrical function of the atria (Figure 2). Unfortunately, all of these mechanisms form vicious circles and are severely aggravated once AF has manifested. Usually, several of these factors have to concur before the arrhythmia develops.

### Tachycardia transition during ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation [^1123cnXC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The "sequential ablation" strategy for persistent AF is aimed at progressive organization of AF until the rhythm converts to sinus rhythm or atrial tachycardia (AT). During ablation of an AT, apparently seamless transitions from one organized AT to another occur. The purpose of our study was to quantify the occurrence and the mechanism of this transition.

Methods and Results

Twenty-nine of 90 patients undergoing ablation for persistent AF had multiple AT during the procedure and constitute the study group. Thirty-nine direct transitions from one AT to another during ablation were observed classified in four types: type I (79.4%), i.e., a direct transition of a faster to a slower tachycardia without significant intervening pause; type II (7.69%) — transition after intervening ectopy or longer pause; type III (10.26%) — A slower AT accelerated; type IV (2.56%) — alteration of activation sequence but with no change on CL.

Conclusions

Transition to a second AT occurs frequently in the midst of ablation of AT in persistent AF patients. This transition occurs most commonly abruptly within the range of a single cycle length of the original AT. This is best explained by a continuation of AT that was "present" simultaneously with the pretransition tachycardia, being "entrained" (for a reentrant tachycardia) or "overdriven" for an automatic focal tachycardia. The presence of multiple tachycardia mechanisms active simultaneously would be consistent with the eclectic pathophysiology of persistent AF.

### The burden of proof: the current state of atrial fibrillation prevention and treatment trials [^11529R3J]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an age-related arrhythmia of enormous socioeconomic significance. In recent years, our understanding of the basic mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate AF has evolved rapidly, catheter ablation of AF has progressed from concept to reality, and recent studies suggest lifestyle modification may help prevent AF recurrence. Emerging developments in genetics, imaging, and informatics also present new opportunities for personalized care. However, considerable challenges remain. These include a paucity of studies examining AF prevention, modest efficacy of existing antiarrhythmic therapies, diverse ablation technologies and practice, and limited evidence to guide management of high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities. Studies examining the long-term effects of AF catheter ablation on morbidity and mortality outcomes are not yet completed. In many ways, further progress in the field is heavily contingent on the feasibility, capacity, and efficiency of clinical trials to incorporate the rapidly evolving knowledge base and to provide substantive evidence for novel AF therapeutic strategies. This review outlines the current state of AF prevention and treatment trials, including the foreseeable challenges, as discussed by a unique forum of clinical trialists, scientists, and regulatory representatives in a session endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society at the 12th Global CardioVascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Washington, DC, December 3–5, 2015.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia with a substantial effect on individual morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare expenditure. The management of AF is complex and fraught with many uncertain and contentious issues. We have seen substantial progress in AF management in the last two decades including better understanding of the epidemiology, genomics, monitoring, drug and non-pharmacological treatment of the arrhythmia, its complications and stroke risk reduction. In this review, we present a comprehensive discussion on AF with emphasis on most recent updates.

### Rhythm control strategies and the role of antiarrhythmic drugs in the management of atrial fibrillation: focus on clinical outcomes [^112dxQre]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common disorder that significantly impacts the lives of affected patients. The restoration of sinus rhythm may prevent AF progression and reduce the occurrence of negative sequelae; however, available antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) have largely failed to demonstrate significant benefit relative to rate control with respect to morbidity and mortality outcomes. The review commentary will address current knowledge regarding the pathologic mechanisms of AF, current trials that investigate rate and rhythm strategies, and future therapies that may change treatment approaches based on preliminary evidence suggesting a more favorable safety profile. The observed outcomes are likely a reflection of the limited efficacy plus poor safety and tolerability of available AADS. However, data from patients who attained and maintained sinus rhythm in a number of clinical studies demonstrate that the achievement of normal sinus rhythm can indeed reduce AF-associated morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the results of trials designed to assess specific morbidity and mortality outcomes such as cardiovascular death hospitalization suggest that the development of safer AF therapies, whether pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic, can potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116PWyji]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Explanations of this gap between prior expert consensus recommendations and routine clinical practice might reflect the current disconnect between indications for catheter ablation and clinical outcomes of the procedure. Another factor can be cost. On one hand, the main indication for catheter ablation is symptomatic AF and decisions regarding continuation of anticoagulation therapy should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence of or type of AF. At the same time, transtelephonic or long-term monitoring is at times recommended after ablation to capture even asymptomatic episodes of AF to evaluate the need to continue anticoagulation. The majority of writing group members do not believe that data currently exist to support this common practice of making decisions regarding anticoagulation based on the presence or absence of AF (see Section 7).

A significant amount of information has accumulated showing that cardiac risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, and hypertension are associated with structural and electrical remodeling of the atria, which forms the substrate leading to AF development and progression (see Section 3). The recommended indefinite annual follow-up visits with a health care professional allow for the evaluation and treatment of associated diseases and lifestyle modification rather than monitoring of the rhythm itself.

Early Recurrence After Ablation

Definition and Incidence

Early recurrences of AF after AF ablation has been defined as any recurrence of AF > 30 seconds during the first 3 months of follow-up. Late recurrence has been defined as any recurrence of AF > 30 seconds between 3 and 12 months after AF. In using the term early recurrence of AF (ERAF) it is recognized that the early recurrence might be AFL or AT. Although we considered defining a new term, early recurrence of ATAs, post-AF ablation, for simplicity we have employed the term early recurrence of AF. Throughout the document and this section of the document, we note that recurrences can present in the form of AF, flutter, or tachycardia.

Early recurrences of AF after RF catheter ablation have been reported in up to 50% of patients within the first 3 months of AF ablation. Because these arrhythmias do not definitively indicate therapy failure over the long term (only half of these patients will manifest later recurrences), this period is also referred to as the blanking or therapy stabilization period. It is also important to recognize that the later AF recurrences are observed during the blanking phase, the lower the chance of long-term success.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) mechanisms and pathophysiology — rate characteristics, triggers, and substrate — are outlined as AF is a chaotic, rapid (300–500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. AF results from electrophysiological and structural abnormalities that disrupt impulse generation or cellular connections, often arising from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA) or from reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis. Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or sufficiently heterogeneous to sustain reentry, and the ECG abnormalities likely reflect a shared phenotype across diverse etiologies.

### A new look at atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from drugs, pacing, and ablation therapies [^111rVKxB]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and among the leading causes of stroke and heart failure in Western populations. Despite the increasing size of clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of AF therapies, achieved outcomes have not always matched expectations. Considering that AF is a symptom of many possible underlying diseases, clinical research for this arrhythmia should take into account their respective pathophysiology. Accordingly, the definition of the study populations to be included should rely on the established as well as on the new classifications of AF and take advantage from a differentiated look at the AF-electrocardiogram and from increasingly large spectrum of biomarkers. Such an integrated approach could bring researchers and treating physicians one step closer to the ultimate vision of personalized therapy, which, in this case, means an AF therapy based on refined diagnostic elements in accordance with scientific evidence gathered from clinical trials. By applying clear-cut patient inclusion criteria, future studies will be of smaller size and thus of lower cost. In addition, the findings from such studies will be of greater predictive value at the individual patient level, allowing for pinpointed therapeutic decisions in daily practice.

Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation (AF) — coexistence, post–CTI ablation AF, and antiarrhythmic-induced flutter: It is common for AF and atrial flutter to coexist in the same patient. After CTI ablation, 22% to 50% of patients have been reported to develop AF after a mean follow-up of 14 to 30 months, although 1 study reported a much higher rate of AF development, with 82% of patients treated by catheter ablation for atrial flutter manifesting AF within 5 years. Risk factors for the manifesting AF after atrial flutter ablation include prior AF, depressed left ventricular function, structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease, inducible AF, and increased LA size. Atrial flutter may result from antiarrhythmic therapy of AF, particularly when flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone is used for treatment of AF, and ablation of the CTI-dependent flutter may prevent recurrent flutter while antiarrhythmic therapy for AF is continued.

Consider performing ablation of the tachycardia if present.

### Atrial fibrillation burden: a new outcome predictor and therapeutic target [^112DFvf5]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Natural progression and regression of atrial fibrillation

The initial presentation of patients with newly diagnosed AF can be paroxysmal, persistent, or with an AF pattern that still requires determination ('first diagnosed'). In the EAST-AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial) trial, an outcome trial that enrolled only patients with recently diagnosed AF, approximately one-third of the patients presented with each of these three AF patterns. When AF is established, typically when rhythm control treatment failed, AF is classified as permanent. Atrial fibrillation often progresses from paroxysmal, self-terminating episodes to persistent AF. On average, this progression is slow: ∼1 in 20 patients (5%/year) will experience progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF per year, and more than half of patients with paroxysmal AF without concomitant conditions do not progress over a 25 year period. Recent clinical research using continuous rhythm monitoring shows that many patients with AF do not show any recurrences in 1 year of follow-up and some even regress, showing paroxysmal AF after periods of persistent AF. This regression of AF patterns is not common, but consistently found. The average AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF is ∼11% when monitored using implanted devices, and similar estimates are found when days in AF are counted in patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing daily telemetric electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. The daily AF burden in RACE-V increased from 3.2% to 3.8%, 5.2%, and 6.1% in patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing continuous rhythm monitoring by implanted devices. In RACE-V, AF progressed to non-paroxysmal patterns in some patients (5.5%/year), some patients regressed, and the overall AF burden remained low. Variable recurrences of AF and the slow and varying progression of AF can explain that 60% of patients randomized to usual care in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial were in sinus rhythm at 2 years, and that AF ablation retains its efficacy after a 12-month waiting period. Conceptually, the AF burden should be 100% in patients with non-paroxysmal AF, but spontaneous regression reduces their arrhythmia burden to 70%–100%(Figure 1).

### Mechanisms of disease: new mechanisms of antiarrhythmic actions [^117EsQti]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many developed countries. Despite intensive investigation, the cellular mechanisms for most cardiac arrhythmias have not been clearly established. As a consequence, drug therapy for most forms of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias remains largely empirical and ineffective, leading to the increased use of nonpharmacologic treatments. Clearly, new approaches to the prevention of cardiac arrhythmias are needed. Here we review the current experimental basis for several promising antiarrhythmic strategies, with a focus on those targeted against atrial and ventricular fibrillation. Although none of these strategies is yet ready for clinical application, they provide a basis for cautious optimism that effective pharmacologic therapy for fatal cardiac rhythm disturbances could be forthcoming.

### Atrial fibrillation – where do we stand today? [^113vxehK]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The basic underlying mechanisms behind atrial fibrillation (AF), the most abundant therapy demanding cardiac dysrhythmia, have until recently being largely unknown. Once established, AF is not only self-perpetuating but also self-destructive, prompting rapid treatment against possible initiating mechanisms. Recent observations reveal that the ectopic beats, initiating AF, often originate in the walls of the pulmonary veins and that the deterioration of the ectopic impulse to AF may be linked to an impaired inferoposterior interatrial conduction. The underlying mechanisms behind these functional defects are still obscure. The observations has however, permitted evaluation of new types of treatment, directly interfering with the newly verified findings.

### Altered atrial metabolism: an underappreciated contributor to the initiation and progression of atrial fibrillation [^111Mo9uG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Currently, about 1% to 2% of the general population suffers from AF. The incidence and prevalence of AF increase in an age‐dependent manner, resulting in a projected AF‐prevalence in the United States in 2050 of ≈16 millions. It is assumed that between a quarter and two‐thirds of the AF population has transient or paroxysmal AF (pAF, defined as AF self‐terminating within 48‐hours) and up to 35% of patients have silent (non‐symptomatic) AF. In addition, each year up to 15% of initially diagnosed pAF patients will progress to persistent (AF persisting > 7 days or requiring termination by cardioversion) or permanent (attempts to achieve sinus rhythm are abandoned) forms.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF in selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF if rhythm control is desired.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^112noXtk]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Mechanisms and pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Heart failure and AF share risk factors and common pathophysiologic processes (see Figure 1). Hypertension, smoking, obesity, diabetes, renal impairment, sleep apnoea, and coronary artery disease are all associated with an increased risk of developing both HF and AF. In HF, neurohormonal imbalance and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to maladaptive physiological changes including increased filling pressures and afterload. These can lead to increased left atrial stretch and fibrosis, contributing to the development of conduction abnormalities and facilitating the initiation and maintenance of AF. – The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system also directly contributes to proarrhythmic remodelling, with angiotensin II causing atrial fibrosis and anisotropic conduction. Patients with HF also demonstrate altered calcium handling and calcium overload, which can lead to after-depolarizations and arrhythmia.

Figure 1
Shared and synergistic mechanisms in heart failure and atrial fibrillation. There is a cycle of interdependence between heart failure and atrial fibrillation and each makes the other more likely to occur. RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Atrial fibrillation can promote the development of HF by a number of established mechanisms. Loss of atrial systole in AF impairs LV filling and can decrease cardiac output by up to 25%, particularly in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Irregular and/or rapid ventricular conduction in AF can lead to LV dysfunction and in some patients, a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Restoration of sinus rhythm increases stroke volume and LV emptying even before contractility improves, explaining why some patients with HF gain rapid haemodynamic improvement with cardioversion.

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, we found that the incidence of clinical AF progression was relatively low and independent of baseline AF type. Several risk factors and comorbidities potentially amenable to therapeutic or lifestyle interventions were significantly associated with AF progression. The incidence of RCI was twice as high as the incidence of clinical AF progression, and main determinants for RCI were symptoms, younger age, and physical activity. RCI did not seem to have a major impact on the clinical progression rate.

The incidence of clinical AF progression was 5.2 progression cases per 100 patient‐years of follow‐up. In a recent meta‐analysis we found a cumulative incidence of clinical AF progression of 8.1 per 100 patient‐years of follow‐up. 6 Our slightly revised definition of AF progression might partly explain the lower incidence in the current study. The relatively low incidence of clinical AF progression seems to be in contrast with the high overall prevalence of nonparoxysmal AF. For example, in the GARFIELD (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD) registry, which enrolled > 17 000 patients with newly diagnosed AF almost 30% of the study participants had nonparoxysmal AF at baseline. 9 We observed a comparable prevalence of 38% nonparoxysmal AF among patients with recent‐onset AF. 10 This raises the question of whether there is a specific population of AF patients in which persistent or permanent AF might be the first clinical manifestation of the arrhythmia.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^117HqUtY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Medical Cardioversion After patients with atrial fibrillation have been stabilized and the ventricular rate has been controlled, conversion to sinus rhythm is the next consideration. The decision to restore sinus rhythm should be individualized. The many reasons for not attempting pharmacologic cardioversion include duration of atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours, recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite multiple treatment attempts, poor tolerance of antiarrhythmic agents, advanced patient age and concomitant structural disease, large size of left atrium, and the presence of sick sinus syndrome. After anticoagulation is initiated, quinidine sulfate, flecainide, or propafenone may be used to attempt pharmacologic conversion. The following intravenously administered drugs may also be used: dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, or amiodarone.

8, 16 A recent review 4 and a meta-analysis 17 concluded that flecainide, ibutilide, and dofetilide were the most efficacious agents for medical conversion of atrial fibrillation, but that propafenone and quinidine were also effective. In the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, procainamide is the drug of choice for converting atrial fibrillation. 7, 8 To prevent thrombus formation, warfarin is continued for four weeks after cardioversion. Although the success rate for electrical cardioversion is high, proper equipment and expertise are necessary for safe performance.
3. 20 documented positive results for emergency-department performance of cardioversion followed by direct discharge of hemodynamically stable patients without congestive heart failure. An alternative approach for achieving earlier return to sinus rhythm is early electrical cardioversion and the use of transesophageal echocardiography according to American Heart Association guidelines.

7 Transesophageal echocardiography is used to detect thrombi in the right atrium. If no thrombi are present, electrical cardioversion can be performed immediately; if thrombi are detected, cardioversion can be delayed until patients have undergone three weeks of oral anticoagulation using warfarin. 21 One recent comparative study 22 found no differences in thromboembolic complications between conventional treatment and early cardioversion following transesophageal echocardiography.

Mechanisms of atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter — classification and examples — are as follows: Atrial arrhythmias can be broadly classified as focal, small circuit, or macroreentry. Examples include isthmus-dependent reverse common (clockwise) atrial flutter, isthmus-dependent common (counter clockwise) atrial flutter, focal atrial tachycardia with circumferential spread of activation of the atria (can arise from multiple sites within the left and right atrium), microreentrant atrial tachycardia with circumferential spread of activation of the atria, perimitral atrial flutter, and roof-dependent atrial flutter.

Atrial fibrillation-induced atrial remodelling — atrial fibrillation itself induces atrial remodelling that contributes to the maintenance, progression, and stabilization of AF, with the high atrial rate causing cellular Ca2+ loading, a decrease in ICaL due to down-regulation of the underlying Cav1.2 subunits, and a concomitant increase in inward rectifier IK1; small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ currents also play a role in AF, and computational modelling shows that increased total inward-rectifier K+ current in chronic atrial fibrillation is the major contributor to the stabilization of re-entrant circuits by shortening APD and hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. Atrial tachycardia remodelling reduces Ca2+-transient amplitude by a variety of mechanisms, contributing to contractile dysfunction, and reduced atrial contractility causes atrial 'stunning' that may be involved in thromboembolic complications; long-term atrial tachycardia remodelling causes conduction slowing in several animal models, at least partly due to INa downregulation.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation progression [^111x3nGn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current thinking indicates that atrial fibrillation (AF) usually progresses from short, rare episodes to longer and more frequent attacks. 1 Patients who develop more sustained forms of the disease are less amenable to treatment and are thought to have a worse outcome. 2, 3 A recent meta‐analysis suggested a higher risk of thromboembolism and death among patients with sustained compared with intermittent forms of AF. 4

In clinical practice, AF is classified into paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF. 1 Even though the classification poorly reflects temporal persistence of the arrhythmia, 5 it is commonly used in daily clinical practice. In a recent meta‐analysis, the cumulative incidence of AF progression was 8.1 per 100 patient‐years. Main predictors explaining between‐study heterogeneity were age, hypertension, follow‐up duration, and baseline AF type. 6

However, previous studies did not take into account at least 2 important issues. First, the change in AF type is not exclusively unidirectional, as AF may also regress to less sustained forms, and prior studies have not acknowledged this. Second, AF progression may be masked to some extent by the use of rhythm control interventions (RCIs). The most effective RCIs currently available are antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone, direct electrical cardioversion (ECV) and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). 7 While RCIs partly overlap with the definition of the clinical AF type, they constitute an independent entity that needs to be taken into account separately.

A better understanding of clinical AF progression and its associated risk factors will improve risk prediction and help to plan specific intervention studies to prevent AF progression. In the current study, we aimed to assess the incidence and associated predictors of clinical AF progression and RCIs in a large cohort of prospectively followed patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) results from the chaotic depolarization of atrial tissue and is the most common dysrhythmia diagnosed in United States (US) emergency departments. AF affects greater than 1% of the general population, with a peak prevalence of 10% in those greater than 80 years of age. By 2050, it is estimated that nearly 16 million US patients will suffer from AF. AF has significant health effects, and places a considerable economic burden on the health care system.

Atrial tachycardias (ATs) after AF ablation — prevalence, mechanisms, and early management: ATs of new onset make up to 50% of all arrhythmias after catheter ablation, commonly arising from reconnected pulmonary vein ostia or macroreentry around obstacles or scar. Occurrence of early AT within 3 months predicts both late AT and AF, but because up to 49% resolve with time, ablation should not be undertaken for early AT occurrence unless symptoms cannot be controlled; initial therapy should include electrical cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). Owing to proarrhythmic concerns with Class Ic agents, Class III antiarrhythmic agents (dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone), together with negative dromotropic agents, are typically preferred, and for intolerable symptoms or continued late AT recurrence, detailed activation and entrainment mapping enables effective ablation in approximately 90% of patients.

### Prevalence and determinants of atrial fibrillation progression in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^113g45Vt]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease, usually starting with self-terminating short-lasting paroxysmal episodes that often progresses to more frequent episodes, eventually leading to long-lasting non-self-terminating persistent and permanent AF. Progression of AF has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduces the efficacy of pharmacological and interventional rhythm control strategies. AF progression rates vary between studies because of differences in duration of follow-up, in comprehensive phenotyping of patients and strategies of rhythm monitoring.

Appropriate treatment of risk factors can improve sinus rhythm maintenance, cardiovascular outcome and reverse AF progression. The most established risk factors for AF progression are age, hypertension, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Interestingly, hypercoagulability may be involved in increasing the risk of stroke and in AF progression. A detailed and multimodal phenotyping at baseline and continuous rhythm monitoring has potential to increase our knowledge of AF progression and in turn contribute to personalised medicine.

Therefore, the aim of the Reappraisal of AF: Interaction Between HyperCoagulability, Electrical Remodelling, and Vascular Destabilisation in the Progression of AF (RACE V) study is to develop a clinical AF progression risk prediction model using extensive phenotyping and continuous rhythm monitoring in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF). In addition, to improve the clinical model and elucidate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AF progression, we included blood biomarkers in the progression risk prediction model.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — comparisons with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line or early therapy: In selected patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation is described as a suitable first-line option, and longer-term follow-up showed reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias versus drugs (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38–0.67]) with fewer persistent AF episodes (1.9% vs 7.4%; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13–0.70]). In CABANA, ablation was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45–0.60]; P < 0.001). Randomized trials comparing ablation to AADs as first-line therapy found at 24 months a lower AF burden with ablation (ablation, 9% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 18%; P = 0.004), and at 1 year fewer recurrent atrial arrhythmias in EARLY-AF (43% vs 68%; P < 0.001) and STOP AF First (25% vs 55%; P < 0.001). Across these trials, procedural complications were observed in 2% to 5% of patients, AF burden remained low in EARLY-AF (percentage of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%), and the average age was ≤ 60 years; ablation is also noted as effective in persistent AF, particularly if of relatively recent onset (< 1 year).

Figure 4 — AF stages: evolution of atrial arrhythmia progression defines AF subtypes and management prompts. Paroxysmal AF (3A) is AF that is intermittent and terminates within 7 d of onset; Persistent AF (3B) is AF that is continuous and sustains for ≥ 7 d and requires intervention; Long-standing persistent AF (3C) is AF that is continuous for ≥ 12 mo in duration; and Successful AF ablation (3D) is freedom from AF after percutaneous or surgical intervention to eliminate AF. Permanent AF is described as no further attempts at rhythm control after discussion between patient and clinician. Management prompts include Treat Modifiable Risk Factors, Consider heightened surveillance, Ongoing monitoring as clinically appropriate for AF burden, and Stroke risk assessment and therapy if appropriate.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — Goals and endpoints for pharmacological therapy: "Whether paroxysmal or persistent, AF is a chronic disorder, and recurrence at some point is likely in most patients". Pharmacological therapy "is indicated in patients who have troublesome symptoms related to paroxysmal AF or recurrent AF after cardioversion who can tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs and have a good chance of remaining in sinus rhythm over an extended period". Study endpoints and quality vary: "The number and quality of studies with each drug are limited; endpoints vary", and "because of clustering of recurrences in the first few weeks after cardioversion, the median time to first recurrence detected by transtelephonic monitoring may not differ between 2 treatment strategies". Importantly, "Recurrence of AF is not equivalent to treatment failure", and "Underlying heart disease or extracardiac disease is present in 80% of patients with persistent AF". Trials "included few patients at risk of drug-induced HF, proarrhythmia, or conduction disturbances".

### Pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: current therapeutic strategies [^117ATJch]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of sustained arrhythmia, is associated with a frightening risk of embolic complications, tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction, and often disabling symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is the treatment used most commonly to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, to prevent recurrences, or to control ventricular response rate.

Methods

This article reviews published data on pharmacologic treatment and discusses alternative systems to classify AF and to choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy.

Results

AF is either paroxysmal or chronic. Attacks of paroxysmal AF can differ in duration, frequency, and functional tolerance. In the new classification system described, 3 clinical aspects of paroxysmal AF are distinguished on the basis of their implications for therapy. Chronic AF usually occurs in association with clinical conditions that cause atrial distention. The risk of chronic AF is significantly increased by the presence of congestive heart failure or rheumatic heart disease. Mortality rate is greater among patients with chronic AF regardless of the presence of coexisting cardiac disease. The various options available for the treatment of chronic AF include restoration of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate. Cardioversion may be accomplished with pharmacologic or electrical treatment. For patients in whom cardioversion is not indicated or who have not responded to this therapy, antiarrhythmic agents used to control ventricular response rate include nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, digoxin, or beta-blockers. For patients who are successfully cardioverted, sodium channel blockers or potassium channel blockers such as sotalol, amiodarone, or a pure class III agent such as dofetilide, a selective potassium channel blocker, may be used to prevent recurrent AF to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

The ultimate choice of the antiarrhythmic drug will depend on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. An additional concern with chronic AF is the risk of arterial embolization resulting from atrial stasis and the formation of thrombi. In patients with chronic AF the risk of embolic stroke is increased 6-fold. Therefore anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for embolization. Selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concepts recently developed by the Sicilian Gambit Group (based on the specific channels blocked by the antiarrhythmic agent) and on clinical experience gained over the years with antiarrhythmic agents. For example, termination of AF is best accomplished with either a sodium channel blocker (class I agent) or a potassium channel blocker (class III agent). In contrast, ventricular response rate is readily controlled by a beta-blocker (propranolol) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Alternatively, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be chosen based on the Vaughan-Williams classification, which identifies the cellular electrophysiologic effects of the drug.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^114g5KqQ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate (cardiac rhythm). When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, with derangements that vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. Irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, constitute cardiac 'arrhythmias'. In the past, drug treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has proven difficult, both because of inadequate effectiveness and a risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for the development of novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article will review recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### A proposal for new clinical concepts in the management of atrial fibrillation [^117AP3To]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a growing public health burden. It is a complex condition, involving a number of etiologic factors and arrhythmia mechanisms associated with atrial remodeling. Greater understanding of these mechanisms may improve therapy. Current AF classification schemes are limited by simplicity. A number of risk factors predict AF onset, and additional factors are being evaluated in registry studies. Doppler imaging and Holter monitoring in high-risk patients to predict the onset of AF and progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF are promising. There is a need for a novel multifactorial classification model encompassing AF duration, symptoms, markers of atrial remodeling, and a risk score for AF onset, persistence, progression, and complications to guide treatment and prognostication. Preventing AF onset with upstream therapy is of great interest, but current data are conflicting. More study is needed to optimize rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs and targeted ablation to specific patient populations at an earlier stage. There is little consensus on optimal rate control and no information relating to optimum rate control in specific populations. This article highlights new concepts in AF and directions for future research.

Atrial fibrillation — flecainide and propafenone efficacy, dosing, and safety caveats: Randomized trials and a Cochrane analysis established efficacy of flecainide and propafenone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF. In the Flec‑SL trial, flecainide prevented episodes of paroxysmal AF in 31% over 4 months versus 9% with placebo. Sustained‑release propafenone 425, 325, and 225 mg twice daily extended median time to AF/AFL/SVT versus placebo (> 300, 291, and 112 days versus 41 days; P < 0.001). Patients with prior MI or significant structural heart disease "should not take" flecainide or propafenone, and individuals on these agents "should be concomitantly taking an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent" to reduce risk of 1:1 atrial flutter.

### Atrial fibrillation [^1124KDUb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and increases in prevalence with increasing age and the number of cardiovascular comorbidities. AF is characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat that can be asymptomatic or lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea and dizziness. The condition can also be associated with serious complications, including an increased risk of stroke. Important recent developments in the clinical epidemiology and management of AF have informed our approach to this arrhythmia. This Primer provides a comprehensive overview of AF, including its epidemiology, mechanisms and pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention and management. Management strategies, including stroke prevention, rate control and rhythm control, are considered. We also address quality of life issues and provide an outlook on future developments and ongoing clinical trials in managing this common arrhythmia.

### Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation-related cardiomyopathies: potential mechanisms and current therapies [^1177mnDX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of new-onset ventricular contractile dysfunction, termed arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). Although cardioembolic stroke remains the most feared and widely studied complication of AF, AIC is also a clinically important consequence of AF that portends significant morbidity and mortality to patients with AF. Current treatments are aimed at restoring sinus rhythm through catheter ablation and rate and rhythm control, but these treatments do not target the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC. Here, we describe the clinical features of the various AIC subtypes, discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC, and review the evidence surrounding current treatment options. In this review, we aim to identify key knowledge gaps that will enable the development of more effective AIC therapies that target cellular and molecular mechanisms.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation progression [^116BvfhM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background The incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation (AF) progression are currently not well defined, and clinical AF progression partly overlaps with rhythm control interventions (RCIs). Methods and Results We assessed AF type and intercurrent RCIs during yearly follow-ups in 2869 prospectively followed patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. Clinical AF progression was defined as progression from paroxysmal to nonparoxysmal or from persistent to permanent AF. An RCI was defined as pulmonary vein isolation, electrical cardioversion, or new treatment with amiodarone. During a median follow-up of 3 years, the incidence of clinical AF progression was 5.2 per 100 patient-years, and 10.9 per 100 patient-years for any RCI. Significant predictors for AF progression were body mass index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05), heart rate (HR per 5 beats/min increase, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08), age (HR per 5-year increase 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.27), systolic blood pressure (HR per 5 mm Hg increase, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00–1.05), history of hyperthyroidism (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), stroke (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19–1.88), and heart failure (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.34–2.13). Regular physical activity (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.98) and previous pulmonary vein isolation (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.90) showed an inverse association. Significant predictive factors for RCIs were physical activity (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20–1.68), AF-related symptoms (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.47–2.30), age (HR per 5-year increase, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85–0.92), and paroxysmal AF (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51–0.73). Conclusions Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were key predictors of clinical AF progression. A healthy lifestyle may therefore reduce the risk of AF progression.

Clinical response outcomes in the minimum set — treatment and management targets are defined: Three clinical response measures are included in the minimum set and are divided into 'Treatment Response' and 'Overall Management Response'; AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence and AF progression (paroxysmal to persistent AF) are recommended to capture treatment response for treatments such as catheter ablation, surgical ablation, or antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and thromboembolic events, defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism, should be measured to assess clinical response with respect to AF management.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^117H1FU9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

### Impact of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation on disease progression [^1161AJu8]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a major public health challenge worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and exponential increase in health care costs. The progression from paroxysmal (defined as self-terminating episodes of AF lasting < 7 days) to persistent AF (eg, AF episodes lasting longer than 7 days) is associated with premature mortality, increasing incidence of thromboembolism and heart failure, as well as increased rates of hospitalization and health care use. Given recognition that complications of AF increase as the disease advances, there is an urgent need to ensure therapeutic interventions are capable of delaying or halting disease progression. Whereas pharmacotherapy can be relatively effective at managing the symptoms associated with AF, antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective than catheter ablation in reducing arrhythmia burden, improving quality of life, and reducing health care use. Moreover, pharmacologic therapy does not modify the pathophysiological processes responsible for disease progression. Catheter ablation confers a more comprehensive disease-modifying intervention, targeting multiple mechanisms underlying AF progression through a combination of trigger elimination, electroanatomical substrate modification, and autonomic nervous system modulation. Until recently, the belief that catheter ablation was an effective method to prevent disease progression was mostly speculative. However, recent randomized controlled trials have established catheter ablation as disease-modifying intervention. Given this knowledge, it appears that early intervention is critical to optimally affect the disease progression. The purpose of this paper is to review the rationale and evidence supporting disease modification using catheter ablation as a key part of the AF treatment paradigm.

### Focal atrial tachycardia [^1115D9Xp]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Focal atrial tachycardia is a relatively uncommon arrhythmia. Nevertheless, the management of highly symptomatic patients with focal atrial tachycardia can be problematic owing to the poor response to medical treatment. Moreover, focal atrial tachycardia can trigger other atrial arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and flutter. Radiofrequency ablation of focal atrial tachycardia is extremely successful and this approach is becoming the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients. In this review, we describe the pathophysiology, anatomical localisation, clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic options for the management of focal atrial tachycardia.

### Radiofrequency catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy: a prospective, randomized, 4-year follow-up trial: the APAF study [^116YLN9E]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Information on comparative outcome between radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) > 1 year after randomization is important for clinical decision-making.

Methods and Results

A total of 198 patients (age, 56 ± 10 years) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to RFA (99 patients) or to AADs (99 patients). We evaluated efficacy of RFA or AADs in a comparable 48-month follow-up period according to intention-to-treat analysis. Cardiac rhythm was assessed with daily transtelephonic transmissions. Quality of life was also analyzed. At 4 years, among the 99 patients first assigned to RFA, the procedure was repeated because of recurrent atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia in 27 patients (27.3%). Among the 99 patients randomly assigned to AADs, 87 (87.9%) crossed over to undergo RFA and 4 years after random assignment only 12 (12.1%) were in sinus rhythm with AAD alone without ablation. Despite the high level of crossovers, at 4 years the intention-to-treat analysis showed that 72.7% of patients in the ablation arm and 56.5% of those initially randomly assigned to AADs were free of recurrent atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia (P = 0.017). During the follow-up, 19.2% of AAD patients progressed to persistent atrial fibrillation before switching to RFA. RFA significantly improved quality of life (P < 0.001), whereas before crossing over to RFA, patients receiving AADs showed poorer quality of life. Except for new left atrial tachycardia, there were no serious complications caused by RFA.

Conclusions

With follow-up extended to 4 years after randomly assigned, ablation remains superior to antiarrhythmic drug in these patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111nFCoa]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Synopsis and epidemiology of AFL and post-ablation AF risk: AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age; it is 2.5 times more common in men than in women and is more likely with underlying heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of the high effectiveness of CTI ablation, many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anticoagulation > 1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF, but subsequent AF after CTI-dependent AFL ablation has been reported as 34% over 14 months. Non–CTI-dependent or "atypical" AFL or atrial tachycardia after AF ablation should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF, and this section refers to treatment of "typical" (CTI-dependent) AFL.

### Heart rate is associated with progression of atrial fibrillation, independent of rhythm [^114X9vkb]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Almost a quarter of the patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF progressed to a more sustained form during a median of 18 months follow-up. The factors with the strongest association with AF progression were AF on baseline ECG, heart rate, age and the presence of heart failure. While a rate or rhythm control strategy was not independently associated with AF progression, lower heart rate and/or stricter rate control may be of importance to prevent AF progression. Finally, identification of patients at risk for progression remains challenging given the discriminatory power of current models, highlighting the need for better measures of AF disease progression.

### Can we predict outcomes in atrial fibrillation? [^115CVKL2]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered by generalists and cardiologists alike. Much of the attendant morbidity from AF arises from systemic embolic complications which are effectively reduced with utilization of anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. The systemic embolic complications of AF and the medical therapy to attenuate these risks are very well established. Through the course of this review, we aim to highlight the complex relationship between AF and other, "non-embolic" outcomes. The presence of AF has been demonstrated to be associated with a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in mortality across numerous observational cohorts. Still further, AF frequently coexists with heart failure, whether as a causative factor or a consequence of underlying structural heart disease or neurohumoral derangement, where its presence is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Whether AF is an independent risk factor for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remains controversial, though its occurrence in patients with ACS has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes both in observational cohorts as well as clinical trial populations. Individuals with AF have a 1.5 to 3-fold increase in the rate of hospitalization and are at elevated risk for other arrhythmic disorders including both bradyarrhythmias as well as tachyarrhythmias. AF leads to considerable morbidity and mortality for patients and exacts a tremendous financial toll on the healthcare system-estimated to range from $6.0 to $26.0 billion. Given the current demographic transition in developed countries, the prevalence of AF will continue to increase and the need for refined approaches to risk stratification and pharmacotherapeutic interventions to attenuate the burden on patients will only become more important.

Table 2 — Atrial fibrillation minimum measure set — clinical response (atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia [AF/AFL/AT] recurrence) defines recurrent AF/AFL/AT as AF/AFL/AT of at least 30 seconds' duration documented by an electrocardiogram (ECG) or device recording system and occurring after catheter ablation or drug therapy. In the setting of catheter ablation, recurrence may occur within or following the post ablation 3-month blanking period, and recurrent AF/AFL/AT that occurs within the post ablation blanking period is not considered a failure of AF ablation.
