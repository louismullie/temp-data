## Question

Lidocaine 2% for mini stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lidocaine 2% has any role in treating a "mini stroke" (transient ischemic attack, TIA) and, if so, how it should be used and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a TIA and the standard of care. Then, I should verify what lidocaine 2% formulations exist and their labeled indications. Next, I will examine whether any clinical evidence supports lidocaine for TIA treatment or prevention. After that, I need to check for any indirect or peri-procedural uses of lidocaine in stroke care that could be confused with TIA therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and provide a clear recommendation with safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. A "mini stroke" is a transient ischemic attack, defined by focal neurological deficits lasting less than 24 hours without permanent infarction on imaging, and the standard of care focuses on rapid evaluation, risk stratification (e.g. ABCD2), antithrombotic therapy, risk-factor modification, and timely specialist referral rather than local anesthetics or antiarrhythmics.

> I need to check what "lidocaine 2%" actually refers to. The 2% lidocaine products in the provided materials are topical/oral viscous solutions indicated for mucosal anesthesia of the mouth and pharynx, with explicit warnings about serious toxicity in infants and young children when misused, and no indication for cerebrovascular disease or TIA treatment [^114NP8V1] [^113ihrzi] [^115nHeyy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could there be any clinical evidence supporting lidocaine for TIA? I should double-check the documents for any stroke-related indications or trials. I find no randomized trials, guidelines, or case series supporting lidocaine 2% for TIA treatment or secondary prevention, and no mechanistic rationale aligns with TIA pathophysiology or guideline-directed therapy.

> Wait, let me verify whether lidocaine appears anywhere in stroke care that might be misconstrued as TIA therapy. There are peri-procedural uses of lidocaine in stroke workflows, such as local anesthesia for radial artery access during thrombectomy and prophylactic intra-arterial lidocaine to blunt the trigeminocardiac reflex during embolization; these are procedural adjuncts, not treatments for TIA itself, and do not translate into therapeutic use for TIA [^117GVaxM] [^116D3DcN] [^1138zHfj].

> I should confirm safety considerations if someone mistakenly considered systemic lidocaine. Intravenous lidocaine carries risks of neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity, including seizures and arrhythmias, and is reserved for specific indications like ventricular arrhythmias; using it off-label for TIA would expose patients to harm without evidence of benefit, which is not justified [^113q3vPQ] [^1161WxTR] [^1122372t].

> Let me synthesize. Lidocaine 2% has no role in TIA treatment or prevention, lacks supporting evidence, and is not indicated for cerebrovascular disease; standard TIA care should follow established pathways including antiplatelet therapy, risk-factor control, and urgent neurological evaluation, while lidocaine should be limited to its approved local anesthetic uses with attention to dosing and toxicity risks.

> Final recommendation: Do not use lidocaine 2% for TIA. Manage TIAs per guideline-directed therapy and reserve lidocaine for appropriate local anesthesia scenarios, adhering to labeled dosing and safety precautions to avoid systemic toxicity, especially in vulnerable populations.

Lidocaine 2% is **not indicated for mini-stroke (TIA)** and should not be used for this purpose. There is **no clinical evidence** that lidocaine 2% improves TIA outcomes, and it is not included in any stroke or TIA guideline. Lidocaine 2% is a local anesthetic for mucous membrane anesthesia and has no role in TIA management. If considered for other uses (e.g. procedural anesthesia), it must be used with caution due to risks of systemic toxicity, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or hepatic impairment [^114NP8V1] [^111rQqim] [^112ar5tK].

---

## Pharmacological properties of lidocaine 2%

Lidocaine 2% is a local anesthetic that **blocks sodium channels**, producing reversible neuronal blockade. It is used for topical anesthesia of mucous membranes (oral, nasal, pharyngeal) and for local infiltration in minor procedures. It is **not designed for systemic use** or for treating ischemic events such as TIA.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding lidocaine 2% in TIA

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of lidocaine 2% for TIA management. No randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports demonstrate benefit in TIA outcomes. Lidocaine is not mentioned in any stroke or TIA guideline as a treatment option.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Using lidocaine 2% in TIA patients may pose **significant risks**:

- **Systemic toxicity**: Seizures, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse, especially with excessive dosing or in patients with impaired clearance [^1161WxTR] [^111xNeoa].

- **Neurological effects**: Dizziness, confusion, and CNS depression, which can obscure neurological assessment in TIA patients [^1161WxTR].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypotension, bradycardia, and arrhythmias, particularly concerning in patients with cardiovascular disease [^1161WxTR].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current stroke and TIA guidelines **do not recommend** lidocaine 2% for TIA management. Standard care focuses on:

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin or clopidogrel to reduce recurrence risk.

- **Risk factor modification**: Blood pressure control, lipid management, diabetes control, and lifestyle changes.

- **Evaluation**: Rapid assessment to identify causative mechanisms and guide secondary prevention.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for TIA

Evidence-based therapies for TIA include:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Antiplatelet agents | - Aspirin <br/> - Clopidogrel <br/> - Ticagrelor | Reduce recurrence risk |
| Anticoagulants | - Warfarin <br/> - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) | Atrial fibrillation or cardioembolic TIA |
| Statins | - Atorvastatin <br/> - Rosuvastatin | Lipid lowering, plaque stabilization |
| Antihypertensives | - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Beta-blockers <br/> - Calcium channel blockers | Blood pressure control |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lidocaine 2% is **not indicated for TIA** and lacks supporting evidence. Its use risks significant adverse effects without benefit. Management should follow guideline-directed antiplatelet therapy, risk-factor modification, and rapid evaluation. Lidocaine 2% should be limited to approved local anesthesia uses, with caution regarding systemic toxicity.

WARNINGS

Medicines intended to be applied to the skin should not be swallowed.

Diclona™ is flammable. Keep away from open flame.

You should never heat, microwave, or add the medicine to hot water.

Risk of Methemoglobinemia

Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with lidocaine use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing the condition. If lidocaine must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood.

Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death.

Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Events

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.

### LIDOCAINE VISCOUS-lidocaine hydrochloride solution… [^115nHeyy]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: Life-threatening and fatal events in infants and young children Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Viscous 2% should generally not be used. For other conditions, the use of the product in patients less than 3 years of age should be limited to those situations where safer alternatives are not available or have been tried but failed. To decrease the risk of serious adverse events with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2%, instruct caregivers to strictly adhere to the prescribed dose and frequency of administration and store the prescription bottle safely out of reach of children. DESCRIPTION.

Mechanism of Action Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Life-threatening and fatal events in infants and young children Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Viscous 2% should generally not be used.

For other conditions, the use of the product in patients less than 3 years of age should be limited to those situations where safer alternatives are not available or have been tried but failed. For infants and in children under 3 years of age, the solution should be accurately measured and no more than 1. 2 mL be applied to the immediate area with a cotton-tipped applicator. Wait at least 3 hours before giving the next dose; a maximum of four doses may be given in a 12-hour period. Lidocaine should only be used if the underlying condition requires treatment with a volume of product that is less than or equal to 1. 2 mL.

### Perioperative management of a patient undergoing a novel mini-invasive percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular reconstruction procedure [^1123iBji]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Survivors of myocardial infarction might have residual damage and higher risks of developing heart failure. This increasing complication encompasses up to 45% of all infarcts. As anesthesiologists we will have to perform anesthesia more frequently in patients with such challenging medical history schedule to undergo mini-invasive surgical procedures. We present the case of a 51-year-old man with severe heart failure post-myocardial infarction with multiple sclerosis undergoing a novel percutaneous transcatheter ventricular reconstruction via a left mini-thoracotomy. To guide the surgeon during the intervention we used a real-time 3D echocardiography, enlightening the fact that guidance is crucial for that kind of procedure. To lower postoperative pain and the inflammatory response we have administered successfully intravenous lidocaine, indicating that it is possible to avoid regional anesthesia in patients with multiple sclerosis scheduled for mini-invasive left ventricular reconstruction requiring a mini-thoracotomy.

### Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block for central post-stroke pain: a case report and review [^114Vc55z]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is refractory to pharmacotherapy (eg, NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), and may require transcranial or deep brain stimulation.

Case Presentation

A 67-year-old woman presented with severe paroxysmal cramp-like pain on the right side, including the head and both upper and lower extremities. The pain started 5 years earlier, was initially mild and occasional, but gradually intensified to an unbearable degree with an average of 10–15 daily episodes, each lasting for 5–10 mins. The patient disclosed "hemorrhagic stroke" 10 years ago that resulted in hemiplegia on the right side. CT examination verified the lesion. The patient received daily injection of 2-mL 2% lidocaine under ultrasound guidance to block the stellate ganglion. Pain subsided rapidly in both intensity and frequency. On the seventh day, the patient no longer had pain episodes. At the last follow-up, 9 months later, the patient was free from pain.

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block is a viable alternative for CPSP that is refractory to pharmacotherapy.

IV lidocaine

IV lidocaine has demonstrated benefit in three well-conducted RCTs of SCI-related NP. One of these trials also included patients with stroke. Two of the studies found a significant reduction in pain intensity with IV lidocaine compared with placebo, whereas the third found no significant difference. The evidence quality of one study was downgraded because of a lack of power calculation and an unclear protocol, while another was downgraded because of a lack of explanation of the randomization process and large confidence intervals. The studies with a positive result used lidocaine 5 mg·kg⁻¹ over 30 min, whereas the study with a negative result used lidocaine 2.5 mg·kg⁻¹ over 40 min. Light-headedness was a common adverse effect. As the duration of benefit for IV lidocaine is very short, this treatment modality should only be considered in specific circumstances where a short duration of effect is desired.

IV alfentanil

A single double-blind cross-over study of nine patients with central dysesthetic pain after SCI evaluated alfentanil and ketamine compared with placebo (normal saline). Alfentanil significantly reduced the intensity of continuous pain compared with placebo (p = 0.01), allodynia compared with placebo and wind-up-like pain compared with placebo. As the response of continuous pain to therapy was only measured before and after the infusion, the duration of response is uncertain. The IV mode of administration of alfentanil makes this therapy a short-term management option with a short duration of effect.

Intrathecal clonidine

One RCT that compared intrathecal clonidine with placebo (saline) found no statistically significant difference in reduction of pain intensity in patients with SCI-related pain, and the evidence quality of the study was downgraded because of a lack of description of the randomization process or patient allocation.

### Comparison of anesthesia methods for intra-arterial therapy of patients with acute ischemic stroke: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review [^111QZDxy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, for high-risk procedures such as IAT in patients with acute ischemic stroke, the volume of surgery performed by a medical center may have a certain impact on the patient's outcomes. A large number of studies have shown that there is a certain relationship between the volume of complex and high-risk surgeries and outcomes. High-level medical centers may have more resources, more advanced equipment, and more experienced medical teams. Medical staff in low-sample centers may lack experience and training. This may have a certain impact on the results, so we also adopted subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and TSA to minimize this impact.

Propofol stands out as the predominant intravenous anesthetic in contemporary anesthesia practice. It mitigates post-ischemic neuronal damage through a variety of mechanisms, including the activation of GABAA receptors, exertion of antioxidant effects, reduction of brain mitochondrial membrane permeability, and augmentation of glutamate uptake. Additionally, Propofol diminishes cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure, and cerebral oxygen metabolic rate, making it the preferred anesthetic for neurosurgical procedures. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, offers a distinct profile in that while it elevates CBF, its impact on overall cerebral oxygen metabolic rate remains minimal. Its neuroprotective properties stem from its ability to thwart the excitotoxic effects of glutamate, a mechanism supported by findings from in vitro and animal studies. Moreover, intravenous lidocaine has emerged as another agent with demonstrated neuroprotective effects in the context of hypoxia-ischemia. This effect is likely attributed to its inhibition of sodium uptake and reduction of neuroinflammation, as evidenced by both in vitro and animal research. In summary, the variance in prognosis observed among different anesthesia methods following IAT treatment for ischemic stroke may, in part, be attributed to the neuroprotective effects of anesthetic drugs. GA could potentially confer neuroprotective benefits in certain disease states linked to cerebral ischemia. While animal experiments offer robust support for this notion, clinical evidence remains scarce. Hence, future research should prioritize investigating the neuroprotective properties of various anesthetic drugs. Subsequently, these findings can inform the selection of safer medications tailored to specific clinical patients or scenarios. This approach aims to fulfill the demands for swift recovery and personalized diagnosis and treatment.

### Diclofenac sodium, with camphor, lidocaine, and methyl salicylate patch (diclovix M) [^114wwzHe]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several oral COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical solution and COX-2 selective and nonselective orally administered NSAIDs, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of an orally administered COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see Contraindications (4)].

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.

The concurrent use of aspirin and NSAIDS, such as diclofenac, does increase the risk of serious GI events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Stellate ganglion block was performed, as described previously. Briefly, 2-mL 2% lidocaine was injected between the internal carotid artery and the longus colli at the C7 level under ultrasound guidance (Figure 2). The block was repeated once every day, and the pain subsided rapidly in both intensity and frequency along with the advancement of daily treatment. On the seventh day after treatment initiation, the patient no longer had pain episode. Thermosensation normalized, and she was able to walk for 200 m on her own. A physical workup showed reduced muscle tension and normalized deep tension reflex. Stiffness persisted, but at a reduced degree that could be readily managed with gabapentin at small doses. At the last follow-up 9 months later, the patient was free from pain and only took gabapentin on-demand occasionally. A repeat cranial CT (Figure 1B) was unremarkable. ADL score increased to 80. HADS score was 6 for anxiety and 8 for depression.

Warnings and Precautions

Medicines intended to be applied to the skin should not be swallowed.

Diclona Gel is flammable. Keep away from open flame.

You should never heat, microwave, or add the medicine to hot water.

Risk of Methemoglobinemia

Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with lidocaine use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing the condition. If lidocaine must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood.

Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death.

Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Events

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.

### Prophylactic intra-arterial injection of lidocaine: a novel strategy to prevent endovascular embolization-induced trigeminocardiac reflex [^116D3DcN]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 156 patients were approached for participation in the study (see online supplemental figure 1). Recruitment ended when the number of included subjects reached the calculated required sample size. Twenty patients were not enrolled or randomized for a variety of reasons including refusal to participate (n = 6), unconsciousness (n = 13), and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Thus, 136 subjects were enrolled in the study, randomized into pairs and allocated with 68 subjects in each group. Data from all 136 subjects were analyzed with no subjects lost during follow-up. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar (table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients

The HR and MAP in the two groups at the six time points are shown in figure 1. Compared with the control group, HR was significantly higher after a prophylactic intra-arterial injection of lidocaine at T5 (63.7 ± 10.6 bpm vs 56.5 ± 18.3 bpm, p < 0.05). Lidocaine pretreatment also resulted in a higher MAP than in the control group at T5 (89.4 ± 14.0 mmHg vs 79.1 ± 25.1 mmHg, p < 0.05) and T6 (90.0 ± 8.6 mmHg vs 84.5 ± 9.0 mmHg, p < 0.05). Furthermore, we compared HR and MAP at T2 with those at other time points within the groups. In the control group, HR was slower at T5 (56.5 ± 18.3 bpm) than at T2 (65.2 ± 7.2 bpm) whereas, in the lidocaine group, HR did not show significant differences at all time points. However, there was no obvious difference in MAP within the control group, while MAP was higher at T5 (89.4 ± 14.0 mmHg) and T6 (90.0 ± 8.6 mmHg) compared with T2 (81.7 ± 8.6 mmHg) in the lidocaine group.

### Minimizing pain during vasectomy: the mini-needle anesthetic technique [^111HuRiw]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We describe pain scores for a modified anesthesia technique for no-scalpel vasectomy using a 1-inch 30 gauge mini-needle.

Materials and Methods

A prospective study was performed in 277 patients who received anesthesia using a 3 cc syringe filled with approximately 2 cc 2% lidocaine without epinephrine and a 1-inch 30 gauge needle. Local anesthesia was given directly to the vas at the expected surgical site on each side.

Results

Mean ± SD pain intensity score on the 10 cm visual analog scale was 1.5 ± 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.7) during the anesthesia and 0.6 ± 1.0 (95% CI 0.5–0.7) during the procedure. Patients experienced less pain during anesthesia and the procedure than they expected before vasectomy (average 3.1 ± 1.8, 95% CI 2.8–3.3).

Conclusions

The mini-needle technique provides excellent anesthesia for no-scalpel vasectomy. It compares favorably to the standard vasal block and other anesthetic alternatives with the additional benefit of minimal equipment and less anesthesia.

### Interventions for intra-operative pain relief during postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation [^111YGXn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation (PPTL) is a contraceptive method that works by interrupting the patency of the fallopian tubes. Several methods are used for intraoperative pain relief, such as systemic administration of opioids or intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of and adverse effects associated with interventions for pain relief in women undergoing PPTL.

Search Methods

We searched for eligible studies published on or before 31 July 2017 in the CENTRAL Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We examined review articles and searched registers of ongoing clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks, grey literature, and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared perioperative pain relief measures during PPTL.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. We extracted the data from the included studies, assessed risk of bias, and calculated and compared results. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author. We computed the inverse variance risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous variables.

Main Results

We found only three RCTs, in which a total of 230 postpartum women participated. Most of our analyses were based on relatively small numbers of patients and studies. Overall, the certainty of evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions was low, due to risk of bias and imprecision. We found very low-certainty evidence regarding the safety of interventions because of risk of bias and imprecision. Two studies had unclear risk of selection bias. One study had unclear risk of reporting bias and a high risk of other bias associated with the study protocol. Women who received an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine experienced lower intensity intraperitoneal pain than those given a placebo (pooled MD -3.34, 95% CI -4.19 to -2.49, three studies, 190 participants, low-certainty evidence), or an intramuscular injection of morphine (MD -4.8, 95% CI -6.43 to -3.17, one study, 40 participants, low-certainty evidence). We found no clear difference in intraperitoneal pain between women who had an intramuscular injection of morphine added to an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine and those who had an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine alone (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.52 to 0.72, one study, 40 participants, low-certainty evidence). An intramuscular injection of morphine alone was not effective for intraperitoneal pain relief compared to placebo (MD 0.50, 95% CI -1.33 to 2.33, one study, 40 women, low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported any serious adverse events but the evidence was very low-certainty. Intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine may reduce the number of women requiring additional pain control when compared to placebo (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.44, three studies, 190 women, low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

An intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine during postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation before fallopian tubes were tied may offer better intraperitoneal pain control, although the evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. We found no clear difference in intraperitoneal pain between women who received a combination of an injection of morphine, and intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine and those who received an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine alone. These results must be interpreted with caution, since the evidence overall was low to very low-certainty.

### Intravenous lidocaine reduces ischemic pain in healthy volunteers [^115Px1x9]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Lidocaine, a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug that alters depolarization in neurons by blocking the fast voltage-gated sodium (Na⁺) channels in the cell membrane, is used for regional anesthesia, as antiarrhythmic drug, and as analgesic for various painful conditions. It is unclear whether monotherapy with intravenous lidocaine has an analgesic effect in healthy individuals. To address this important question, we studied pain perception before, during, and after the administration of intravenous lidocaine in 16 human volunteers. Our hypothesis was that lidocaine, administered as a short intravenous infusion, does not have an analgesic effect in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Sixteen healthy human volunteers received systemic lidocaine at plasma concentration 2 mg/mL using a computer-assisted infusion. Participants underwent a series of sensory tests-thermal, electrical, and ischemic pain and normal pinprick sensation-at baseline, during, and 30 mins after administration of a 20-min lidocaine infusion at a 2 mg/mL effect site concentration.

Results

We found a sustained decrease in ischemic pain ratings and a limited analgesic effect for electrical pain, whereas thermal pain and normal sensation did not change.

Conclusions

The observed sustained analgesic effect of systemic lidocaine in the ischemic pain model suggests that lidocaine may be used to treat acute pain.

### Mechanical ventilation and neurocritical patients: is there a role for anti-neuroinflammatory therapies? [^114vvFBR]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with great attention and interest the review by Robba and colleagues on mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

The authors examined the pathophysiology of stroke and the risk for pulmonary complications (brain-lung "dangerous" crosstalk, immunological response after stroke, stroke-associated pneumonia, and dysphagia) then concluding with useful recommendations on optimal ventilator settings and therapeutic strategies.

Several preclinical evidence supports that MV correlates with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction.

Surprisingly the authors in their review cite a paper from Hegeman and colleagues that challenge the hypothesis of the relationship between MV and brain inflammation state: "In the brain, MV did not induce a significant change in adhesion molecule mRNA expression as compared with non-ventilated controls, did not induce a detectable cytokine or chemokine response, myeloperoxidase activity was below detection level in all experimental groups".

Of interest, the study from Klinger and colleagues reported evidence on the effect of intravenous lidocaine on the transcerebral inflammatory response during cardiac surgery. In their randomized controlled clinical trial, the authors aimed to investigate the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of intravenous lidocaine and observed "a reduction in the transcerebral activation of platelet-monocyte conjugates after aortic cross-clamp release. This may be a manifestation of reduced cerebral inflammation during cardiopulmonary bypass in response to treatment with lidocaine".

To conclude, do the authors, according to the collected evidence, consider it relevant to the neuroinflammation associated with MV?

Do the authors consider it worthy — in patients with acute brain damage — to establish an appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy for preventing additional iatrogenic damage, for example, by taking advantage of the blunting effect of lidocaine on neuroinflammatory response?

Methods

Study design

The study protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board. The authors declare that all supporting data are present within the article. We conducted a retrospective analysis and identified 15 consecutive patients who underwent treatment for acute stroke via mechanical thrombectomy between December 2018 and April 2019. Patients who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset only received a CT angiogram; those with a large vessel occlusion, with an ASPECTS score of 6 or greater, were deemed candidates for thrombectomy. Patients who presented after 6 hours were evaluated via both CT angiogram and CT perfusion imaging, and those with a completed infarct of < 50% on the latter were taken for treatment. We accessed patients' electronic medical record and collected relevant data related to their procedure for analysis.

Radial artery catheterisation technique

All procedures were conducted using conscious sedation. The right wrist is prepped and draped, and local lidocaine is administered. (Left wrist access is obtained rarely for cases where access to the left vertebral artery is necessary, and unreachable from the right side. However, the specifics of the following technique are pertinent to carotid access; for posterior circulation vessel occlusion, different catheters are usually used.) Radial artery catheterisation is achieved using ultrasound guidance, via double-wall puncture and Seldinger technique. After access is achieved, a 6 French Cook shuttle sheath (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indianapolis, USA) is used to catheterise the radial artery, and a radial 'cocktail' consisting of 2000 units of heparin, 5 mg of nicardipine and 200 µg of nitroglycerin is then administered intra-arterially through the sheath. A small skin incision is made over the sheath to facilitate placement of the larger working sheath, and a radial run is then performed to evaluate the vascular anatomy.

### Amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114QwBCx]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) was published by Peter J Kudenchuk and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the trial question was: what is the role of lidocaine in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT? In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the population was: 2052 patients (392 female, 1660 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT after at least one shock, and vascular access. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of open-label IV lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation; known hypersensitivity to study drugs. In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the interventions were: n = 993 lidocaine (a total dose of 180 mg in lidocaine kit) n = 1059 placebo (normal saline kit). In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge (23.7% vs. 21%; AD 2.6%, 95% CI -1 to 6.3). In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score ≤ 3 (17.5% vs. 16.6%; AD 0.9%, 95% CI -2.4 to 4.2) Significant increase in return of spontaneous circulation at emergency department arrival (39.9% vs. 34.6%; AD 5.4%, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.5) Significant increase in hospital admission (47% vs. 39.7%; AD 7.4%, 95% CI 3.1 to 11.6). In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events. In the ROC-ALPS (lidocaine) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT after at least one shock, and vascular access, lidocaine was not superior to placebo with respect to survival to hospital discharge.

### Duloxetine and lidocaine (duloxicaine) [^112Tm3V1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In all 3 trials, duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities.

In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of duloxetine at the same dosage (N = 216) or to placebo (N = 213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥ 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking duloxetine experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2).

Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) endovascular treatment — anesthetic technique selection: Local anesthesia with conscious sedation is associated with lower mortality and better neurological outcomes compared with general anesthesia (GA), and allows neurological monitoring without anesthetic induction delay but may risk aspiration, respiratory depression, undesirable movement, and possibly increased procedure duration; GA provides airway control, patient immobility, and possibly reduced duration but may cause blood pressure fluctuations, restrict neurological monitoring, require qualified anesthesia providers, and may be associated with pneumonia and sepsis. We recommend that the choice of anesthetic technique and pharmacological agents should be individualized with the neurointerventionalist; GA may be preferable in uncooperative or higher-severity patients who cannot protect their airway (class IIa, level of evidence B), while local anesthesia with sedation and GA are feasible options for cooperative anterior circulation stroke (class IIa, level of evidence B). In all patients receiving local anesthesia with sedation, the anesthesia provider should be prepared to rapidly convert to GA if needed (class IIa, level of evidence C). If GA is chosen, standardized protocols for early postprocedural neurological assessment and extubation should be used; there is no recommendation on a specific pharmacologic agent or combination, and anesthesia-related procedures should be done as quickly as possible to avoid delay in endovascular treatment.

Appendix A — Basic Standards for Preanesthesia Care (ASA 2005) states that these standards apply to all patients who receive anesthesia care, that in exceptional circumstances these standards may be modified, that the circumstances shall be documented in the patient's record, and that an anesthesiologist shall be responsible for determining the medical status of the patient and developing a plan of anesthesia care. Before the delivery of anesthesia care, the anesthesiologist is responsible for reviewing the available medical record; interviewing and performing a focused examination of the patient to discuss the medical history, including previous anesthetic experiences and medical therapy, and to assess aspects of the patient's physical condition that might affect decisions regarding perioperative risk and management; ordering and reviewing pertinent available tests and consultations as necessary for the delivery of anesthesia care; ordering appropriate preoperative medications; ensuring that consent has been obtained for the anesthesia care; and documenting in the chart that the above has been performed.

### Anatomical and technical considerations of CT-guided C1-C2 lateral joint injections: technique, pitfalls, and risks [^112Yf6FZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Injectate Selection

An isolated diagnostic injection may be performed using 1% lidocaine for immediate, short-acting effect or 0.25% bupivacaine, which has a short onset with analgesia lasting approximately 5 hours; there is no literature supporting the preferential use of one over the other. We typically use 1% lidocaine for diagnostic injections because its short-acting effect is preferable in outpatient settings. The literature does not favor any specific steroid for symptomatic relief, and options such as dexamethasone, depot triamcinolone, betamethasone, or methylprednisolone may all be considered. For therapeutic injections, we utilize a combination of 0.5 mL 1% lidocaine and 1 mL dexamethasone 10 mg/mL as the initial treatment. We prefer non-particulate steroids such as dexamethasone in the cervical spine because the risk of intravascular injection of particulate steroids leading to embolization of the brain vasculature is catastrophic, potentially resulting in acute infarct or death. If a patient previously had a successful injection with dexamethasone and returns with persistent pain, we will discuss the risks and benefits of attempting a particulate steroid injection, such as triamcinolone-acetate, to achieve longer-lasting pain relief.

### The protective role of lidocaine in surgeries involving trigeminal nerve manipulation: a meta-analysis of trigeminocardiac reflex prevention [^1153ceNG]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

We conclude that determining the optimal dose of lidocaine remains unclear and requires further investigation. It is possible that factors such as weight could contribute to its efficacy, as the literature suggests that lidocaine has an excellent safety profile when administered at doses below 4.5 mg/kg, with some recommendations advocating for a dosage of 2 mg/kg(18). The same for age and overall health status which may influence the optimal dosage for individual patients. Therefore, healthcare providers should carefully consider these factors when determining appropriate dosages of lidocaine for their patients.

Most of the studies included in our analysis did not prioritize the evaluation of lidocaine's safety as a primary outcome. However, Bohluli et al. reported that lidocaine did not result in any significant adverse effects or complications among their study participants. Conversely, Sun et al. documented several adverse events, including dizziness, postoperative nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and other severe unexpected events in 13 out of 68 patients (19.1%). Yorgancilar et al. Tibiano et al. and Zhang et al. on the other hand, did not explicitly mention any side effects associated with lidocaine administration. It is noteworthy that Sun et al.'s study utilized intra-arterial injection as the route of administration for lidocaine, which may explain why only participants in this study experienced side effects while others did not. That's why, it is essential to discern whether observed adverse events are a consequence of lidocaine specifically, inherent manifestations of the anesthetic procedure, or indicative of the underlying TCR pathology.

Our findings align with numerous studies utilizing lidocaine as an intervention for TCR during surgeries. Several case reports have recommended the use of lidocaine to counter TCR. For instance, Sun et al. documented two cases in which intra-arterial injections of 10–20 mg of lidocaine during endovascular embolization effectively suppressed TCR. Similarly, Coleman et al reported successful termination of TCR by administering intra-arterial lidocaine during the endovascular embolization of a carotid sinus fistula. These reports highlight the effectiveness of lidocaine in managing TCR, despite implementing other measures such as increasing anesthesia levels and utilizing glycopyrrolate which was ineffective, In addition, other studies supported the use of topical lidocaine like Meuwly et al. other studies recommended using lidocaine combined with other medications like anticholinergic or atropine than lidocaine alone. Yoshida et al. and Kim. et al. reported the use of IV lidocaine infiltration, IV atropine, and IV glycopyrrolate respectively as effective measures for TCR inhibition.

Authors' response

Battaglini D; Bonatti G; Robba C; Rocco PRM; Pelosi P

Dear Editor,

We thank Professor Bilotta and colleagues for their interest in our recent scientific contribution. The authors pointed out the role of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke, thus advising the relevance of possible novel pharmacological strategies.

First, we were asked to clarify our point of view regarding the existence of significant neuroinflammation induced by mechanical ventilation in stroke, as challenged by Hegeman and colleagues. We fully agree with the importance of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke patients, and in our review, discussed only few of those papers referring to neuromodulation in stroke. Different perspectives have been reported in the literature, which focus on the complex interaction among the neuroendocrine, neuroinflammatory, autonomic and immunologic pathways, both implicated in lung injury that can affect the brain. Furthermore, different neuromodulation patterns, as well as different brain-lung interactions, may occur due to mechanical ventilation or primary cerebral pathologies.

Second, as suggested, novel anti-inflammatory therapies for modulating the neuroinflammatory response (such as lidocaine) could play a role in the near future. This is another interesting issue that we did not take into consideration in our review, which focused on mechanical ventilation strategies in stroke. Experimental and clinical perspectives suggest a wide range of promising therapies against neuroinflammation in stroke, including molecular modulation, such as those reported by the use of minocycline in rats or by modulating the vagal and dopaminergic pathways. Newer biomolecular targets, such as noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, stem cell therapy, microRNA, and interleukins, all of which are still in the preclinical stages of research, are also of the utmost interest. However, addressing these would have exceeded the scope of our study.

Materials and methods

Patients

This was an investigator-initiated prospective double-blind randomized and paired trial conducted in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from June 2020 to July 2021 (chictr.org.cn ChiCTR2000034503; July 7, 2020). The study was approved by the ethics committee (The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University/Jiangsu Province Hospital, China, June 19, 2020). Written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients before inclusion in the study. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the conduct of the study and reviewed blinded safety data.

All patients were aged > 18 years with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), DAVF or CCF. They were planned to undergo Onyx embolization under general anesthesia. Participants were screened and recruited by study staff who evaluated patient eligibility, obtained informed consent, and enrolled the participants. Exclusion criteria included known allergies to any of the drugs used for anesthesia or to any of their excipients, severe cardiovascular disease and urgent surgery. Patients with preoperative confusion and communication difficulties were also excluded.

Study design

Randomization and interventions

Patients were matched into 68 pairs based on their diagnosis and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control group pretreated with intra-arterial saline or the lidocaine group pretreated with intra-arterial injection of 20 mg lidocaine. Randomization was centralized and computer generated, and each patient was given a unique randomization number. All operation procedures were performed by the same neurosurgeon who was unaware of the grouping during intra-arterial injection and the Onyx embolization. Treatment assignments were concealed from patients, non-medical research staff, the statistician, and the data and safety monitoring committee.

### A prospective study to establish the minimal clinically important difference of the mini-BESTest in individuals with stroke [^113X9RYd]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A flowchart of participant recruitment is provided in Figure 1. Fifty patients with stroke (mean (SD) age 60.8 (9.4) years, men = 34/50) participated in the study (Table 1). Treatment duration varied from 1.3 to 42 weeks (mean (SD) = 17.4 (10.6)) and on average patients completed 91% of the treatment proposed.

Figure 1.
Participant recruitment flowchart.

Table 1.
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants (n = 50).

The average (SD) Mini-BESTest score at admission was 18.2 (6.5) and 22.4 (5.2) at discharge (effect size: 0.7) and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The Mini-BESTest showed no floor or ceiling effects. At admission, 2 (2.9%) participants scored 5, and 1 (1.4%) participant scored 27. At discharge, 1 (1.4%) participant scored 7 and 5 (7.2%) scored 27.

The interrater reliability of the global rating of change scale ratings between patients and physiotherapists showed no agreement, weighted kappa = 0.06 (probability value = 0.54,), 95% CI (-.131,.256). The correlation between global rating of change score and change in the Mini-BESTest was 0.33 (P = 0.020) for therapists, and 0.09 (P = 0.519) for patients.

The minimal clinically important difference for small (4 points) and substantial change (5 points) was similar for both patient and physiotherapist perception and aligned well with the distribution-based minimal detectable change (Table 2).

Methods

Patients

In total, 45 subjects were recruited from the memory clinic of the Department of Neurology at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Mitte. This study was approved by the Charité Ethics committee (number EA4/221/20) and all patients gave written informed consent prior to study inclusion. Samples were handled with pseudonymized identifiers and investigators were blinded to the diagnosis.

Patients were diagnosed according to current clinical guidelines. Severity of dementia was rated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and classified as mild (MMSE 21–26), moderate (MMSE 10–20), or severe (MMSE < 10). The patients were grouped as follows: (1) patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 23) and (2) patients without AD (n = 22) including patients with affective disorders (n = 7), Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Lewy body dementia (n = 2), frontotemporal dementia (n = 1), corticobasal syndrome (n = 1), CLIPPERS (n = 1), migraine (n = 1), myasthenia gravis (n = 1), dystonic tremor (n = 1), IgLON5 disease (n = 1), NMDAR encephalitis/MS overlap (n = 1), epilepsy (n = 1), cervical dystonia (n = 1), and stroke (n = 1).

Skin biopsy and fixation

All patients underwent a 3 mm skin punch biopsy after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine from the lateral malleolus area, ~10 cm above the ankle. The sample was placed in Zambonis solution at 4 °C overnight, washed in 1x PBS and then placed in cryoprotectant solution (glycerol, Sörensen buffer, and water) at 4 °C overnight. Then, the samples were frozen and stored at −80 °C. The whole biopsy was cut into 50 µm sections using a cryostat. The sections that were used for the staining were immediately placed in 1x PBS.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^111xNeoa]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Local anesthetics — Local anesthetic agents act by prolonging deactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels in peripheral neurons to reduce or reversibly block neuronal transmission and produce local analgesia or anesthesia, but when absorbed systemically they can cause severe adverse effects such as cardiac arrest and seizure. Attention must thus be given to weight-based maximum doses to avoid toxicity (eg, lidocaine 4–5 mg/kg, maximum 300 mg/dose and 2400 mg/day), and care must be taken to avoid intravascular or intraneural injection. Local anesthetics can be applied topically to the skin or mucous membranes, injected directly into peripheral tissues, or adjacent to regional nerves or even the spinal cord to produce regional or neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for local anesthetic systemic toxicity, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ASRA 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that the timing of LAST presentation is variable, with immediate (< 60 seconds) presentation suggesting intravascular injection of local anesthetic with direct access to the brain, whereas presentations delayed 1–5 minutes suggesting intermittent intravascular injection, lower extremity injection, or delayed tissue absorption. Obtain close monitoring for at least 30 minutes after injection of potentially toxic doses of local anesthetic, as LAST can present more than 15 minutes and occasionally over an hour after injection.

### Neuropsychiatric side-effects of lidocaine: examples from the treatment of headache and a review [^113nd8A6]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Lidocaine has been used in treatment of patients with refractory headache. Personal observations of neuropsychiatric toxicity in these patients led us to review our cases and the literature systematically for lidocaine side-effects, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms. In our series of 20 patients, side-effects were observed in all, the most frequent being neuropsychiatric (75%) and cardiological (50%). When reviewing published series on intravenous lidocaine use, reports of side-effects range from 0 to 100%, with neuropsychiatric symptoms being reported in 1.8–100%. Thirty-six case reports of lidocaine-induced psychiatric symptoms were also analysed. Psychiatric symptoms of toxicity were similar in most patients, despite their differing ages, pathologies, co-therapies and lidocaine dosages. In conclusion, lidocaine neuropsychiatric toxicity has a well-recognized stereotypical clinical presentation that is probably unrecognized in headache series. As lidocaine represents an emerging alternative therapy in headache, particularly in short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing, clinicians and patients should be aware of the extent of this problem.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride oral topical solution USP, 2% (viscous) [^114NP8V1]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Lidocaine Hydrochloride Oral Topical Solution 2% is indicated for the production of topical anesthesia of irritated or inflamed mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx. It is also useful for reducing gagging during the taking of X-ray pictures and dental impressions. Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type, or to other components of the solution.

Life-threatening and fatal events in infants and young children Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Oral Topical Solution 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Hydrochloride Oral Topical Solution 2% should generally not be used. Tolerance varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age, weight and physical condition. Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block. The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness after each local anesthetic administration.

For infants and in children under 3 years of age, the solution should be accurately measured and no more than 1. 2 mL be applied to the immediate area with a cotton-tipped applicator. Wait at least 3 hours before giving the next dose; a maximum of four doses may be given in a 12-hour period. Lidocaine Hydrochloride Oral Topical Solution 2% should only be used if the underlying condition requires treatment with a volume of product that is less than or equal to 1. 2 mL.

PRECAUTIONS

General: The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose, because of slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block.

Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or necrosis may result. Preparations containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in patients during or following the administration of potent general anesthetic agents, since cardiac arrhythmias may occur under such conditions.

Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be accomplished after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that restlessness, anxiety, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, depression or drowsiness may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.

Photothrombotic stroke induction

Photothrombotic stroke was induced as previously described. Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane vaporized in oxygen. Once the breathing rate of the mice reached a frequency of ~50 breaths per minute, indicating a deep state of anesthesia, the mice were removed from the induction chamber and were placed head-first into a Davids Kopf Instruments stereotactic frame for surgery. A self-fabricated face mask consisting of a rubber tube with a small cut-in vent enabled continuous anesthesia with a lower concentration of isoflurane (1–2%). Body temperature was kept constant at 36–37 °C using a heating pad placed underneath the surgical setup. Toe pinch reflex initiation was attempted by pinching the animal's webspace area between the thumb and the second proximate finger to ensure deep anesthesia. After the animal showed no sign of a reflex, eye lubricant (Vitamin A, Bausch&Lomb) was smeared onto the eyes to prevent dryness throughout the surgical procedure. The animal's head was shaved with an electric razor from the neck up to the beginning of the snout. Emla™ Creme 5% (consisting of lidocaine and prilocaine) was then spread onto the scalp with a Q-tip and put into the ears. Ear bars were then gently inserted into the lidocaine-saturated ears underneath the ear bone to fixate the skull. An ~1 cm incision was made along the longitudinal fissure, and the skin was retracted by hand far enough to expose Lambda and Bregma. The fascia was removed from the skull with a Q-tip, and the periosteum of the lower right hemisphere was scraped off with a surgical scalpel. Using an Olympus SZ61 Surgery microscope, bregma was located. With the help of a WPI UMP3T-1 stereotactic coordinate system, the exact locus of stroke induction [-2.5 mm to + 2.5 mm medial/lateral and 0 mm to + 3 mm from Bregma] was identified and marked with a pen. Rose Bengal dissolved in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution[15 mg/ml] was injected intraperitoneally [10 μl/g bodyweight] 5 min prior to illumination with a standard insulin needle to ensure systemic circulation. An Olympus KL1500LCD ("4") cold light source illumination lamp [150 W, 3000 K] with a surface area of 4 mm x 3 mm was positioned onto the previously marked locus, and illumination ensued for 10 minutes. Once illumination ended, the mouse was placed into an empty cage. 30 minutes post-surgery, the mouse's skull was imaged using LDI to confirm stroke induction. After stroke verification, the incision was sutured using a Braun surgical suture kit. Betadine® was applied to the suture, and the mouse was returned to an empty cage, followed by standard post-op care.

### Anesthetic neuroprotection in experimental stroke in rodents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139hvUw]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke may require general anesthesia to undergo the procedure. At present, there is little clinical evidence to guide the choice of anesthetic in this acute setting. The clinical implications of experimental studies demonstrating anesthetic neuroprotection are poorly understood. Here, the authors evaluated the impact of anesthetic treatment on neurologic outcome in experimental stroke.

Methods

Controlled studies of anesthetics in stroke using the filament occlusion model were identified in electronic databases up to December 15, 2015. The primary outcome measures, infarct volume, and neurologic deficit score were used to calculate the normalized mean difference for each comparison. Meta-analysis of normalized mean difference values provided estimates of neuroprotection and contributions of predefined factors: study quality, the timing of treatment, and the duration of ischemia.

Results

In 80 retrieved publications anesthetic treatment reduced neurologic injury by 28% (95% CI, 24 to 32%; P < 0.0001). Internal validity was high: publication bias enhanced the effect size by 4% or less, effect size increased with study quality (P = 0.0004), and approximately 70% of studies were adequately powered. Apart from study quality, no predefined factor influenced neuroprotection. Neuroprotection failed in animals with comorbidities. Neuroprotection by anesthetics was associated with prosurvival mechanisms.

Conclusions

Anesthetic neuroprotection is a robust finding in studies using the filament occlusion model of ischemic stroke and should be assumed to influence outcomes in studies using this model. Neuroprotection failed in female animals and animals with comorbidities, suggesting that the results in young male animals may not reflect human stroke.

Adverse effects

All trials involved close monitoring for adverse effects. No side effects were reported in the intravenous lidocaine trial. In the lidocaine group, there were no reported adverse effects such as nausea, lightheadedness or perioral numbness. Following close monitoring, no serious complications (respiratory arrest, hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia) were observed. ECG readings were unchanged postinfusion. However, patients were only followed up for 30 min postinfusion. In Morris-Stiff et al 's trial, patients were followed for 28 days following commencement of gabapentin to monitor for side effects. There were no documented side effects. Both ketamine trials reported significant adverse effects in the intervention groups. In Mitchell and Fallon's trial, despite all patients receiving oral haloperidol 1.5 mg on the evening of the infusion, 33% of patients reported feeling 'more emotional than usual' 24 hours after the ketamine; 6% of the placebo group reported this symptom (OR of 7.7; p = 0.05). In Persson et al 's trial, side effects were divided into two groups: circulation and psychotropic. There was a marginal effect on systolic blood pressure after varying doses of ketamine (mean blood pressure rises approximately 10% for ketamine dose (0.45 mg/kg)). There was no significant effect on heart rate. All patients in the ketamine group experienced perceptual disturbances and psychotropic effects. These effects were dose dependent; at the highest dose all patients had side effects deemed 'unacceptable' even for a short-term treatment. Unacceptable side effects were effects which involved disturbances of perception, dizziness/vertigo or pronounced sedation. No patients received antipsychotic therapy to limit adverse effects. No patients withdrew because of adverse effects. Both Aurilio et al 's trials on the combination of buprenorphine and epidural morphine/ropivacaine found higher incidences of adverse effects in the control group (2009 trial: 59% vs 81%, p < 0.001; 2005 trial: 45% vs 71%, no p value reported). All side effects reported were common opioid-induced effects (drowsiness, fatigue, constipation and nausea). Withdrawal from the trials occurred in one patient from the control group in the 2005 trial and two patients from the control group in the 2009 trial. The higher rate of symptoms reported in the control group was felt to be secondary to the increased need for additional rescue doses of epidural morphine in the control group.

### Local anesthetics: uses and toxicities [^11533xyr]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Surgeons are asked to do more and larger procedures as outpatient procedures as the economics of medicine evolve. Indeed, we all carry out procedures on an outpatient basis that only a short time ago we would consider only on an inpatient basis. Further, procedures that had previously been performed under a general anesthetic are now being performed under local anesthesia. A good working knowledge of local anesthetics (LAs) will better enable the surgeon to meet those demands and to do so in a way that will enhance the patient's safety, experience, and comfort. Although the focus of this issue of Clinics is minor surgery, any meaningful discussion of LAs has to go a little further than a 3-mL syringe and a small amount of lidocaine.

### Prophylactic intra-arterial injection of lidocaine: a novel strategy to prevent endovascular embolization-induced trigeminocardiac reflex [^1138zHfj]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the present study, prophylactic intra-arterial injection of small doses of lidocaine through the indwelling catheter safely and effectively inhibited the trigeminal nerve cardiac reflex during cerebral vascular embolization. This new approach could be recommended for use during surgical procedures where there is a risk of TCR activation, especially in the case of recurrent and profound bradycardia in DAVF and embolization via the middle meningeal artery and its branches. As the communication between neurons and blood vessels is well known, such a strategy could be extended to use in all kinds of vascular interventional surgery to prevent and treat surgical manipulation-related neurovascular complications including pain and neuronal-vascular-cardiac reflex.

### Ketorolac tromethamine, lidocaine hydrochloride, povidine iodine (ketorocaine L kit) [^111Dzko2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac tromethamine, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years follow-up.

### General anesthesia versus conscious sedation and local anesthesia during thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke [^1154GJsH]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

As numerous questions remain about the best anesthetic strategy during thrombectomy, we assessed functional and radiological outcomes in stroke patients treated with thrombectomy in presence of general anesthesia (GA) versus conscious sedation (CS) and local anesthesia (LA).

Methods

We conducted a cohort study on prospectively collected data from 4429 patients enrolled in the Italian Registry of Endovascular Treatment in Acute Stroke.

Results

GA was used in 2013 patients, CS in 1285 patients, and LA in 1131 patients. The rates of 3-month modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 were 32.7%, 33.7%, and 38.1% in the GA, CS, and LA groups: GA versus CS: odds ratios after adjustment for unbalanced variables (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]), 0.811 (95% CI, 0.602–1.091); and GA versus LA: aOR, 0.714 (95% CI, 0.515–0.990). The rates of modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2 were 42.5%, 46.6%, and 52.4% in the GA, CS, and LA groups: GA versus CS: aOR, 0.902 (95% CI, 0.689–1.180); and GA versus LA: aOR, 0.769 (95% CI, 0.566–0.998). The rates of 3-month death were 21.5%, 19.7%, and 14.8% in the GA, CS, and LA groups: GA versus CS: aOR, 0.872 (95% CI, 0.644–1.181); and GA versus LA: aOR, 1.235 (95% CI, 0.844–1.807). The rates of parenchymal hematoma were 9%, 12.6%, and 11.3% in the GA, CS, and LA groups: GA versus CS: aOR, 0.380 (95% CI, 0.262–0.551); and GA versus LA: aOR, 0.532 (95% CI, 0.337–0.838). After model of adjustment for predefined variables (age, sex, thrombolysis, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, onset-to-groin time, anterior large vessel occlusion, procedure time, prestroke modified Rankin Scale score of < 1, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant), differences were found also between GA versus CS as regards modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2 (aOR, 0.659 [95% CI, 0.538–0.807]) and GA versus LA as regards death (aOR, 1.413 [95% CI, 1.095–1.823]).

Conclusions

GA during thrombectomy was associated with worse 3-month functional outcomes, especially when compared with LA. The inclusion of an LA arm in future randomized clinical trials of anesthesia strategy is recommended.

### Anaesthetic management of the patient with acute ischaemic stroke [^1142qkA4]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Anaesthetic management of the acute stroke patient demands consideration of the penumbra as the central focus. Recent studies have shown that patients who receive general anaesthesia for endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke have worse outcomes than those who receive local anaesthesia. Although baseline condition of the patients in these studies differed, we should heed the warnings evident in the results. 'Time is brain': therapy should be quickly provided. Arterial pressure should be monitored carefully upon induction, avoiding a drastic reduction, and allowing for a reduction in arterial pressure upon recanalization. Keeping these factors in mind, anaesthetic technique (general, monitored anaesthesia care, or local) must be selected considering the individual patient's risks and benefits. Unfortunately, there are no proven neuroprotective strategies to date for use in acute ischaemic stroke.

### Type of anaesthesia for acute ischaemic stroke endovascular treatment [^112WPmwv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of mechanical thrombectomy to restore intracranial blood flow after proximal large artery occlusion by a thrombus has increased over time and led to better outcomes than intravenous thrombolytic therapy alone. Currently, the type of anaesthetic technique during mechanical thrombectomy is under debate as having a relevant impact on neurological outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of anaesthesia for endovascular interventions in people with acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register of Trials on 5 July 2022, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and seven other databases on 21 March 2022. We performed searches of reference lists of included trials, grey literature sources, and other systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials with a parallel design that compared general anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia, conscious sedation anaesthesia, or monitored care anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke. We also included studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, studies without a comparator group, and studies with a retrospective design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The outcomes were assessed at different time periods, ranging from the onset of the stroke symptoms to 90 days after the start of the intervention. The main outcomes were functional outcome, neurological impairment, stroke-related mortality, all intracranial haemorrhage, target artery revascularisation status, time to revascularisation, adverse events, and quality of life. All included studies reported data for early (up to 30 days) and long-term (above 30 days) time points.

Main Results

We included seven trials with 982 participants, which investigated the type of anaesthesia for endovascular treatment in large vessel occlusion in the intracranial circulation. The outcomes were assessed at different time periods, ranging from the onset of stroke symptoms to 90 days after the procedure. Therefore, all included studies reported data for early (up to 30 days) and long-term (above 30 up to 90 days) time points. General anaesthesia versus non-general anaesthesia(early) We are uncertain about the effect of general anaesthesia on functional outcomes compared to non-general anaesthesia (mean difference (MD) 0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.31 to 0.31; P = 1.0; 1 study, 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in time to revascularisation from groin puncture until the arterial reperfusion (MD 2.91 minutes, 95% CI -5.11 to 10.92; P = 0.48; I² = 48%; 5 studies, 498 participants; very low-certainty evidence). General anaesthesia may lead to no difference in neurological impairment up to 48 hours after the procedure (MD -0.29, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.59; P = 0.52; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 982 participants; low-certainty evidence), and in stroke-related mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; P = 0.94; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 330 participants; low-certainty evidence), all intracranial haemorrhages (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29; P = 0.63; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 693 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to non-general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia may improve adverse events (haemodynamic instability) compared to non-general anaesthesia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79; P = 0.02; I² = 71%; 2 studies, 229 participants; low-certainty evidence). General anaesthesia improves target artery revascularisation compared to non-general anaesthesia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I² = 29%; 7 studies, 982 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no available data for quality of life. General anaesthesia versus non-general anaesthesia (long-term) There is no difference in general anaesthesia compared to non-general anaesthesia for dichotomous and continuous functional outcomes (dichotomous: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.58; P = 0.16; I² = 29%; 4 studies, 625 participants; low-certainty evidence; continuous: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.06; P = 0.17; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 978 participants; low-certainty evidence). General anaesthesia showed no changes in stroke-related mortality compared to non-general anaesthesia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.22; P = 0.44; I² = 12%; 6 studies, 843 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no available data for neurological impairment, all intracranial haemorrhages, target artery revascularisation status, time to revascularisation from groin puncture until the arterial reperfusion, adverse events (haemodynamic instability), or quality of life. Ongoing studies We identified eight ongoing studies. Five studies compared general anaesthesia versus conscious sedation anaesthesia, one study compared general anaesthesia versus conscious sedation anaesthesia plus local anaesthesia, and two studies compared general anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia. Of these studies, seven plan to report data on functional outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale, five studies on neurological impairment, six studies on stroke-related mortality, two studies on all intracranial haemorrhage, five studies on target artery revascularisation status, four studies on time to revascularisation, and four studies on adverse events. One ongoing study plans to report data on quality of life. One study did not plan to report any outcome of interest for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

In early outcomes, general anaesthesia improves target artery revascularisation compared to non-general anaesthesia with moderate-certainty evidence. General anaesthesia may improve adverse events (haemodynamic instability) compared to non-general anaesthesia with low-certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in neurological impairment, stroke-related mortality, all intracranial haemorrhage and haemodynamic instability adverse events between groups with low-certainty evidence. We are uncertain whether general anaesthesia improves functional outcomes and time to revascularisation because the certainty of the evidence is very low. However, regarding long-term outcomes, general anaesthesia makes no difference to functional outcomes compared to non-general anaesthesia with low-certainty evidence. General anaesthesia did not change stroke-related mortality when compared to non-general anaesthesia with low-certainty evidence. There were no reported data for other outcomes. In view of the limited evidence of effect, more randomised controlled trials with a large number of participants and good protocol design with a low risk of bias should be performed to reduce our uncertainty and to aid decision-making in the choice of anaesthesia.

Description of patients with significant hemodynamic fluctuations

We further analyzed the anatomical site and affected cerebral blood vessels that might be associated with TCR. The incidence of TCR was mostly seen in patients with DAVF (75.0%) and those in whom the middle meningeal artery was the major vessel supplying the lesion site (58.3%). In patients who solely experienced a 20% increase in MAP during the process of embolization, there was no significant difference in DAVF and middle meningeal artery compared with other lesion sites and affected cerebral blood vessels. We therefore conclude that patients with DAVF and in whom the middle meningeal artery is the major supplying vessel are more likely to experience TCR with bradycardia and hypotension.

We detailed the occurrence, treatment, and classification in the 12 cases of TCR (see online supplemental table 1). There were three severe TCR cases presenting with cardiac arrest during Onyx embolization which were classified as IVa; two of them received immediate CPR/epinephrine and one was treated with atropine which resulted in a return to normal sinus rhythm shortly after the treatment. Notably, the two patients who required CPR suffered from DAVF with the middle meningeal artery affected. A further four TCR cases were classified as IVa, with the slowest HR < 40 bpm prior to the reduction of MAP that required intravenous administration of atropine. The remaining IVb type TCR cases showed an increase in MAP followed by HR reduction without requiring any treatment.

Composite adverse events occurred in 29 of the 68 patients (42.6%) in the control group and in 13 of the 68 patients (19.1%) in the lidocaine group. The incidence of postoperative adverse events including dizziness, postoperative nausea and vomiting, muscle weakness and other events (aphasia, hypopsia and cerebral infarction) were similar in the two groups (table 3). There were three cases of severe cardiac arrest in the control group but none in the lidocaine group.

### Lidocaine coinfusion alleviates vascular pain induced by hypertonic saline infusion: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114Y6Yx1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Hypertonic sodium chloride solution is one of the fluids commonly used in clinical practice. It is frequently utilized for management of hyponatremia, reducing intracranial pressure, and alleviating cerebral edema associated with neurological injuries. Furthermore, hypertonic saline is effectual in the resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock. It is also an alternative for volume preloading before anesthesia, and for perioperative fluid management.

In some institutions, it is common practice to allow only central venous line infusion of hypertonic saline due to the safety concerns associated with peripheral venous infusion such as extravasation, tissue ischemia, phlebitis, and venous thrombosis. Nevertheless, growing evidence has demonstrated that the incidence of local tissue damage was very low and the degree of injury was mild, when 3% sodium chloride solution was infused peripherally for a prolonged duration. One study that evaluated children receiving 3% hypertonic saline via peripheral veins reported no infusion-related complications. Considering the potential complications associated with central venous catheters (CVC), such as infection, hematoma, and pneumothorax, many clinicians have begun to question the necessity of central venous cannulation specifically for continuous infusion of medications with high osmolality. In our study, we adopted peripheral venous access instead of CVC for hypertonic saline infusion, and none of the 99 patients experienced any infusion-associated tissue injuries. Though it was not the primary research objective, our study did further prove the safety of peripheral intravenous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline.

### Lidocaine 5% (lidocan IV) [^1118bRgC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours.

Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value < 0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups.

### Even' safe' medications need to be administered with care [^112ar5tK]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man with a history of hepatic cirrhosis and cardiomyopathy underwent transoesophageal echocardiogram. He received mild sedation and topical lidocaine. During the recovery period the patient developed ataxia and diplopia for about 30 mins, a result of lidocaine toxicity. The patient was administered a commonly used local anaesthetic, a combination of 2% viscous lidocaine, 4% lidocaine gargle and 5% lidocaine ointment topically to the oropharnyx. The total dose was at least 280 mg. Oral lidocaine undergoes extensive first pass metabolism and its clearance is quite dependent on rates of liver blood flow as well as other factors. The patient's central nervous system symptoms were mild and transient but remind us that to avoid adverse side effects, orally administered drugs with fairly high hepatic extraction ratio given to patients with chronic liver disease need to be given in reduced dosages. Even 'Safe' medications need to be carefully administered.

### Prophylactic intra-arterial injection of lidocaine: a novel strategy to prevent endovascular embolization-induced trigeminocardiac reflex [^115YWBPK]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Endovascular embolization is a common procedure for treating cerebrovascular malformation due to its good outcomes and relatively low-risk profile. However, the occurrence of TCR during treatment of abnormal vascular shunts may result in an intensive autonomic disturbance of the heart which manifests as a decrease in the HR, hypotension, arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest. In the present randomized controlled trial we found that a 20 mg lidocaine injection in the cerebral artery could effectively inhibit the incidence of TCR without central nervous side effects, showing that the prophylactic intra-arterial application of low-dose lidocaine is safe and effective in blocking endovascular embolization-induced TCR. Our result confirms the findings of two recent published case reportsin which 5–20 mg lidocaine prevented TCR during endovascular treatment in a patient with CCF and two patients with DAVF.

Preventive and therapeutic measures of TCR commonly recommended include cessation of surgical procedures once TCR occurs (such approach usually reverses the hemodynamic disturbance immediately), increasing the depth of anesthesia, application of anticholinergic agents such as atropine or vasoactive drugs (epinephrine) for refractory bradycardia and hypotension, and local anesthetic infiltration or nerve blocks. However, in some cases recurrent and profound bradycardia is resistant to pretreatment with anticholinergic agents and increased depth of anesthesia. Topical anesthesia is not applicable for vascular embolization-induced TCR as the surgical manipulation is an interventional but not open surgery. Nerve block is also not feasible because it might cause intracranial hemorrhage and infection during cerebrovascular interventional surgery. It is known that local anesthetic infiltration or nerve blocks involved in the afferent trigeminal neuronal pathway may achieve prophylaxis of the peripheral TCR. Therefore, based on the knowledge that a local intravenous injection of lidocaine can effectively prevent injection pain, we extrapolate it to the intra-arterial injection for cerebrovascular embolization surgery and anticipate blocking both activation of the trigeminal nerve and nerve–vascular communication.

### Efficacy of preemptive topical lidocaine 5% plaster in the prevention of post-craniotomy pain, a randomized clinical trial [^116ND6T7]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Solid food was prohibited for 8 h and water for 4 h in all patients prior to surgery. After transfer to the operating room, electrocardiogram, heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂) were continuously monitored. A peripheral venous cannula was inserted, and an intravenous (IV) infusion of crystalloid solution was started. Each participant was premedicated with IV midazolam 0.03 mg/kg before induction of general anesthesia. About 1.5–2.0 mg/kg propofol and 10–15 μg sufentanil were used for standard induction of anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was provided by intravenous cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) for tracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, patients were mechanically ventilated with volume-controlled ventilation (6–8 mL/kg) to achieve an end-tidal CO₂ level of 28 to 35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with 4–8 mg/kg/hour propofol and 0.1–0.3 µg/kg/min remifentanil intravenously; anesthesiologists could adjust the remifentanil and propofol infusion dose as needed. Antihypertensive drugs or vasoactive drugs would be administered as needed, and crystalloid and colloid solutions would be infused as necessary, by the anesthesiologist in charge, to maintain the MAP and heart rate within 30% of baseline values. Extra neuromuscular blockers and sufentanil were given as needed.

A loading dose of 0.1μg/kg sufentanil was administered to each participant for post-operative analgesia in the post-anesthesia care unit. We define uncontrolled post-operative pain as a VAS score greater than 4, which has the potential to adversely impact sleep quality, and uncontrolled post-operative pain was to be treated with an intravenous rescue bolus of 2 μg of sufentanil.

Sixty-two patients recovered and two died (3.2%). In one case, a 19-month-old infant accidentally swallowed the content of a 2% lidocaine oral solution. The newborn quickly became hypotonic and cyanotic. After the arrival of the rescue, the newborn presented a bradycardia and seizures. Benzodiazepine administration and CPR were performed but were unsuccessful. The second case concerned a one-month-old newborn suffering from cystic fibrosis in whom lidocaine has been used for visceral surgery. Long-lasting seizures occurred without other detailed mentioned. Plasma level of lidocaine was performed 24 h after administration reaching 1.3 mg/L. Several days after the event, the newborn presented a coma, and a cerebral echography showed a severe cerebral ischemia. The newborn died approximately 2 weeks after the event.

### Intraoperative intracarotid injection of anesthetics for postoperative blood pressure lability management in carotid endarterectomy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1147QCHZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is commonly performed to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis but is linked to perioperative blood pressure instability. Intracarotid lidocaine injection has been proposed to improve postoperative hemodynamic stability, but evidence of its efficacy and safety remains mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the intraoperative intracarotid injection of local anesthetics in CEA, following PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes included postoperative blood pressure variability, adverse cardiovascular events, and overall complication rates. Secondary outcomes assessed mortality and incidence of restenosis in the short and long term. Seven RCTs comprising 652 patients were included, with lidocaine as the most commonly used anesthetic. No statistically significant differences were found in postoperative hypotension (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.62–2.76), hypertension (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.5–2.15), or mean blood pressure (MD 4.12 mmHg, 95% CI -3.35–11.60). Additionally, postoperative rates of arrhythmias (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.7–2.12), myocardial infarction (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.08–54.6), overall complications (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.74–2.66), and cerebrovascular accidents (OR 2.55, 95% CI 0.61–10.57) did not differ significantly between groups. Intraoperative intracarotid injection of local anesthetic shows no significant benefit for stabilizing postoperative blood pressure in CEA patients. This meta-analysis did not support the hypothesized reduction in carotid sinus sensitivity. However, the small sample size increases the risk of type II error, and long-term outcomes, especially restenosis rates, require further investigation.

### Lidocaine viscous 2% (lidocaine hydrochloride oral topical solution… dailymed.nlm.nih.gov › dailymed › fda › fdaDrugXsl… [^113ihrzi]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

LIDOCAINE VISCOUS- lidocaine hydrochloride solution Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. ----------. Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Viscous 2% should generally not be used. For other conditions, the use of the product in patients less than 3 years of age should be limited to those situations where safer alternatives are not available or have been tried but failed. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure.

These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Viscous 2% should generally not be used. For other conditions, the use of the product in patients less than 3 years of age should be limited to those situations where safer alternatives are not available or have been tried but failed. If not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, acidosis, bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

If cardiac arrest should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with lidocaine. For infants and in children under 3 years of age, the solution should be accurately measured and no more than 1. 2 mL be applied to the immediate area with a cotton-tipped applicator. Wait at least 3 hours before giving the next dose; a maximum of four doses may be given in a 12-hour period. Lidocaine should only be used if the underlying condition requires treatment with a volume of product that is less than or equal to 1. 2 mL.

### The use of intravenous lidocaine for postoperative pain and recovery: international consensus statement on efficacy and safety [^1122372t]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenous lidocaine is used widely for its effect on postoperative pain and recovery but it can be, and has been, fatal when used inappropriately and incorrectly. The risk-benefit ratio of i.v. lidocaine varies with type of surgery and with patient factors such as comorbidity (including pre-existing chronic pain). This consensus statement aims to address three questions. First, does i.v. lidocaine effectively reduce postoperative pain and facilitate recovery? Second, is i.v. lidocaine safe? Third, does the fact that i.v. lidocaine is not licensed for this indication affect its use? We suggest that i.v. lidocaine should be regarded as a 'high-risk' medicine. Individual anaesthetists may feel that, in selected patients, i.v. lidocaine may be beneficial as part of a multimodal peri-operative pain management strategy. This approach should be approved by hospital medication governance systems, and the individual clinical decision should be made with properly informed consent from the patient concerned. If i.v. lidocaine is used, we recommend an initial dose of no more than 1.5 mg·kg⁻¹, calculated using the patient's ideal body weight and given as an infusion over 10 min. Thereafter, an infusion of no more than 1.5 mg·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ for no longer than 24 h is recommended, subject to review and re-assessment. Intravenous lidocaine should not be used at the same time as, or within the period of action of, other local anaesthetic interventions. This includes not starting i.v. lidocaine within 4 h after any nerve block, and not performing any nerve block until 4 h after discontinuing an i.v. lidocaine infusion.

### Helium-based plasma radio frequency technology for subdermal coagulation in the forehead: a preliminary, single-center retrospective study [^112Dy7Sw]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Methodology

After administering anesthesia, two 3–4 cm incisions were made behind the hairline: one just lateral to the medial forehead on each side (one 1 cm from the midline and the other 4 cm from the midline) (Fig. 1). The treatment area was then infused with 30 cc of tumescent solution (0.2% lidocaine and 5 µg/mL epinephrine in normal saline) per side to ensure sufficient infiltration, an aspect of treatment which is important for optimal outcomes. After several minutes, during which the anesthetic was permitted to affect the treatment area, the area was undermined with a 1.9-mm diameter cannula. The helium plasma RF device was then applied to forehead and above the brow. The area was treated with between three and five passes at each incision point, based on patient skin quality and anatomy, within the supraperiosteal or subgaleal plane. Patients with thinner skin were treated with fewer passes to minimize the chances of overheating the epidermis. An example of the individual strokes comprising each treatment pass is shown in Fig. 1; however, strokes can be modified based on the areas of the eyebrows that need to be lifted. Within the patient group described here, several of the patients received treatment in the area above the lateral brow as well. The degree of lift achieved can be appreciated in Fig. 2 where an intraoperative photograph of a patient is shown where half of the brow has been elevated. Settings were 65% power, 1 L/min of helium flow, and activation speed of 1–3 cm. Importantly, strokes were between 1 cm and 3 cm apart to maintain both efficacy and safety. Following treatment, all excess helium gas was manually expressed from the treated tissue and aspirated. A video of the procedure is shown in Video 1. It is important to avoid the surpraorbital and supratroclear nerves; an assistant can protect the area during the procedure. By treating in the supraperiosteal plane, the frontal branch of the facial nerve is avoided.

### Topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain in adults [^112jbxcN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that is sometimes used on the skin to treat neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of topical lidocaine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and to assess the associated adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 1 July 2014, together with the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing any formulation of topical lidocaine with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only full journal publication articles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and that we considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that we considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 12 studies (508 participants) in comparisons with placebo or an active control. Six studies enrolled participants with moderate or severe postherpetic neuralgia, and the remaining studies enrolled different, or mixed, neuropathic pain conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia and postsurgical or post-traumatic neuralgia. Four different formulations were used: 5% medicated patch, 5% cream, 5% gel, and 8% spray. Most studies used a cross-over design, and two used a parallel-group design. Two studies used enriched enrolment with randomised withdrawal. Seven studies used multiple doses, with one to four-week treatment periods, and five used single applications. We judged all of the studies at high risk of bias because of small size or incomplete outcome assessment, or both. There was no first or second tier evidence, and no pooling of data was possible for efficacy outcomes. Only one multiple-dose study reported our primary outcome of participants with ≥ 50% or ≥ 30% pain intensity reduction. Three single-dose studies reported participants who were pain-free at a particular time point, or had a 2-point (of 10) reduction in pain intensity. The two enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal studies reported time to loss of efficacy. In all but one study, third tier (very low quality) evidence indicated that lidocaine was better than placebo for some measure of pain relief. Pooling multiple-dose studies across conditions demonstrated no clear evidence of an effect of lidocaine on the incidence of adverse events or withdrawals, but there were few events and the withdrawal phase of enriched enrolment designs is not suitable to assess the true impact of adverse events (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence from good quality randomised controlled studies to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief of pain. Clinical experience also supports efficacy in some patients. Several large ongoing studies, of adequate duration, with clinically useful outcomes should provide more robust conclusions about both efficacy and harm.
