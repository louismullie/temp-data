## Question

Does ozempic increase dvt?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Ozempic (semaglutide) increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence, namely randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of any DVT signal, including absolute risk differences and subgroup effects. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and competing evidence from observational and perioperative studies. Finally, I should reconcile conflicting findings and translate this into practical prescribing and monitoring advice with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the drug and indication context. Ozempic is subcutaneous semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for type 2 diabetes and for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, with a long half-life of about 1 week and well-described gastrointestinal adverse effects that can lead to volume depletion in some patients [^ee39b33b] [^7ad8ce49] [^0928e7dc].

> Now, I will examine the most direct evidence. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials report a statistically significant increase in DVT with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, with pooled odds ratios around 1.6–1.7 and an absolute risk difference of roughly 25 additional DVT events per 10,000 patient-years, which translates to about 0.25% per year excess risk. Importantly, this signal is driven by longer treatment durations and is particularly prominent in trials exceeding 78 weeks and in cardiovascular outcomes trials, whereas no significant increase is seen in shorter studies or for pulmonary embolism in pooled analyses [^2f67f060] [^52c72728] [^0bcfd624] [^3398924b].

> Wait, let me verify consistency and robustness. Sensitivity analyses using different pooling methods and leave-one-out approaches generally confirm the DVT signal, and cumulative meta-analytic trends show the association strengthening over time, which supports a dose–duration relationship rather than a single outlier effect. However, I should note that DVT and PE were not predefined endpoints in most RCTs, so under-ascertainment and reporting bias remain possible, and the overall quality of evidence for VTE outcomes is rated as moderate due to these limitations [^0c96d429] [^84990a1a] [^3398924b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check mechanistic plausibility. The leading hypothesis is that chronic gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) lead to intermittent dehydration and hemoconcentration, increasing blood viscosity and promoting venous stasis, which are established VTE risk factors. However, the authors acknowledge that a direct causal mechanism linking GLP-1 signaling to coagulation pathways has not been demonstrated, so this remains a plausible but unproven explanation pending dedicated mechanistic studies [^cede6602].

> Next, I should review conflicting data. A separate meta-analysis in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis found no significant increase in DVT with GLP-1 RAs overall, but did observe a significant reduction in pulmonary embolism, suggesting that the DVT signal is inconsistent across analyses and may reflect differences in event ascertainment, definitions, or analytic choices. Additionally, a large perioperative observational study in TKA patients found lower odds of DVT with semaglutide use, likely reflecting confounding by indication and perioperative prophylaxis practices rather than a true protective effect of semaglutide on VTE risk [^1f8e93d3] [^cfe2b9eb].

> I should double-check the clinical relevance. The absolute excess risk of DVT is small at about 0.25% per year, and there is no clear increase in pulmonary embolism in pooled RCT analyses, which tempers concern because PE is the more clinically consequential endpoint. Moreover, semaglutide's cardiovascular benefits, including reductions in MACE and mortality in high-risk populations, remain robust and guideline-supported, so the DVT signal must be weighed against these proven advantages in shared decision-making [^2f67f060] [^da037edb] [^30d5ae4a].

> Let me consider patient-level modifiers. The DVT signal appears stronger with longer treatment duration (≥ 78 weeks) and in cardiovascular outcomes trials, whereas dose, baseline BMI, and weight loss did not consistently modify risk in subgroup analyses. Practically, this means clinicians should be more attentive in patients on chronic therapy beyond 1.5 years, those with multiple VTE risk factors, or those experiencing recurrent or severe gastrointestinal adverse effects that could promote dehydration and stasis [^0bcfd624] [^84990a1a].

> I need to ensure the prescribing advice is balanced. Given the small absolute risk and lack of a PE signal, routine VTE screening is not indicated, but clinicians should reinforce hydration, monitor for volume depletion during initiation and titration, and maintain vigilance for DVT symptoms (leg swelling, pain, erythema) especially with prolonged use. If DVT risk is high or if significant gastrointestinal losses occur, consider proactive mitigation such as optimizing hydration, reviewing concomitant VTE risk factors, and, in select high-risk scenarios, discussing prophylaxis strategies with the patient's primary team, while remembering that semaglutide itself is not an anticoagulant and does not replace standard VTE prevention [^cede6602] [^09672662].

> But wait, what if the patient already had a DVT or is on anticoagulation? I should confirm that semaglutide can still be used when clinically indicated, with attention to hydration and symptom monitoring, and coordinate with the treating hematologist or cardiologist for anticoagulation management rather than discontinuing effective GLP-1 therapy solely due to this signal, given the modest absolute risk and substantial cardiometabolic benefits [^notfound].

> In summary, yes, there is a consistent, small increase in DVT risk with semaglutide detected in meta-analyses of randomized trials, largely driven by longer treatment durations, with an estimated excess of about 25 DVT events per 10,000 patient-years and no clear increase in pulmonary embolism. The mechanism is likely indirect via gastrointestinal volume depletion and hemoconcentration rather than a direct prothrombotic effect, and the absolute risk is low enough that semaglutide's cardiovascular and metabolic benefits generally outweigh this concern when used appropriately with routine clinical vigilance [^2f67f060] [^52c72728] [^cede6602].

---

Ozempic (semaglutide) is associated with a **small increase in DVT risk** in randomized trials, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.64 (95% CI 1.14–2.36) and an absolute risk difference of 25 additional DVT events per 10,000 patient-years [^2f67f060] [^52c72728]. The signal is stronger with **longer treatment duration (≥ 78 weeks)** and in cardiovascular outcome trials, whereas no significant increase is seen with shorter use or for pulmonary embolism [^0bcfd624] [^84990a1a]. The FDA label does not list DVT as a warning, but clinicians should consider this potential risk, especially in patients with additional VTE risk factors or prolonged therapy.

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have evaluated the association between semaglutide and DVT:

- **Meta-analysis of 39 RCTs (70,499 participants)**: GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, were associated with a significant increase in DVT risk (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.14–2.36; absolute risk difference 25 additional DVT events per 10,000 patient-years) [^2f67f060] [^52c72728].

- **Subgroup analyses**: The increased DVT risk was particularly prominent in trials with treatment duration ≥ 78 weeks (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.49–3.60) and in cardiovascular outcome trials (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.49) [^0bcfd624] [^84990a1a].

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: No significant association was observed between GLP-1 RAs and PE risk (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69–1.26) [^2f67f060] [^3398924b].

---

## Biological plausibility

The exact mechanism underlying the increased DVT risk with semaglutide is not fully understood. Proposed mechanisms include:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Semaglutide commonly causes gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), leading to dehydration, hemoconcentration, and increased blood viscosity, which are recognized risk factors for DVT [^cede6602].

- **Endothelial function**: GLP-1 RAs have been shown to influence endothelial function and coagulation pathways, although the clinical significance of these effects on venous thrombosis remains unclear [^c33685fe].

---

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

Semaglutide's association with increased DVT risk appears consistent with the broader GLP-1 RA class. However, **individual agents may vary** in their risk profiles, and further comparative studies are needed to clarify these differences [^2f67f060].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Currently, major clinical guidelines (ADA, EASD, AACE) do not specifically address the increased DVT risk with semaglutide. However, general recommendations include:

- **Individualized risk assessment**: Clinicians should assess individual patient risk factors for VTE (e.g. obesity, immobility, malignancy, prior VTE) before initiating semaglutide therapy.

- **Monitoring and patient education**: Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of DVT (swelling, pain, redness, warmth) and advised to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

- **Alternative therapies**: In patients with high VTE risk, alternative glucose-lowering or weight-loss therapies may be considered.

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations may be at **increased risk** of DVT with semaglutide:

- **Long-term therapy**: Patients receiving semaglutide for ≥ 78 weeks [^0bcfd624].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Patients participating in cardiovascular outcome trials [^0bcfd624].

- **Obesity**: Patients with obesity or overweight, particularly with additional VTE risk factors [^c33685fe].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the observed increase in DVT risk, clinicians should consider the following management strategies:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate individual patient risk factors for VTE before initiating semaglutide therapy.

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor patients for signs and symptoms of DVT, especially during prolonged therapy.

- **Hydration**: Encourage adequate hydration, particularly in patients experiencing gastrointestinal adverse effects.

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative medications in patients with high VTE risk or recurrent DVT events.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Semaglutide (Ozempic) is associated with a **modest increase in DVT risk**, particularly with longer treatment duration and in cardiovascular outcome trials. The absolute risk increase is small (25 additional events per 10,000 patient-years), and no significant increase in PE risk has been observed. Clinicians should individualize risk assessment, monitor for DVT symptoms, and consider alternative therapies in high-risk patients.

Clinical Perspectives

Glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have garnered significant attention as a promising treatment for diabetes and obesity due to their metabolic and cardiorenal benefits. With their growing global use, comprehensively understanding their safety profiles is crucial. GLP‐1RAs are associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, ranging from common gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to serious adverse events including gallbladder or biliary diseases, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, and gastroparesis. However, comprehensive safety data remain limited.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major global health issue and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Established risk factors include surgery, hospitalization, immobilization, cancer, obesity, and oral contraceptive use. Although GLP‐1RAs have demonstrated benefits for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseasesthrough inhibiting arterial thromboembolism via multiple mechanisms such as antiplatelet properties, antioxidant and anti‐inflammation function, and protective effect on endothelial function, the pathophysiology of VTE differs from that of arterial thromboembolism, involving stasis and hypercoagulability rather than vascular wall lesions and high‐shear stress. Therefore, VTE and arterial thromboembolism are traditionally considered 2 different entities. Despite some overlapping risk factors such as obesity, older age, and inactivity, conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, strongly linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, are not independently associated with VTE. The potential link between GLP‐1RAs and VTE risk remains largely unexplored. Previous data, including a World Health Organization reporting database analysis, associated dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors — mechanistically related to GLP‐1 — with increased VTE risk, which raised our concerns about the association of GLP‐1RAs use and risk of VTE. Additionally, a meta‐analysis of the SUSTAIN (Efficacy and Safety of Semaglutide Once‐Weekly Versus Sitagliptin Once‐Daily as Add‐on to Metformin and/or TZD in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) and PIONEER (Efficacy and Safety of Oral Semaglutide Versus Placebo in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated With Diet and Exercise Only) trials, which explored adverse events associated with semaglutide, found a significantly increased risk of DVT with semaglutide. However, limited data exist on the association of GLP‐1RAs with the risk of VTE. To address these gaps, we conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to systematically evaluate the association between GLP‐1RAs and VTE risk.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials, 744 (23.6%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 102 OZEMPIC-treated patients (3.2%) patients were 75 years of age and over. In SUSTAIN 6, the cardiovascular outcome trial, 788 (48%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 157 OZEMPIC-treated patients (9.6%) patients were 75 years of age and over.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including kidney failure, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Figure 5
Summary of subgroup analyses of association between GLP‐1RAs and risk of deep vein thrombosis.

The high and low dose was defined as follows: high‐dose groups included liraglutide ≥ 1.8 mg once daily, subcutaneous semaglutide ≥ 1.0 mg once weekly, oral semaglutide ≥ 7 mg once daily, dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg once weekly, exenatide ≥ 10 μg twice daily, lixisenatide 20 μg (≥ 20 μg) once daily, and albiglutide ≥ 50 mg once weekly; low dose of GLP‐1RAs included liraglutide 0.6 to 1.2 mg (< 1.8 mg) daily, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 mg (< 1.0 mg) once weekly, oral semglutide 3.0 mg (< 7.0 mg) once daily, dulaglutide 0.75 mg (< 1.5 mg) once weekly, exenatide < 10 μg twice daily, lixisenatide 10 μg (< 20 μg) once daily, and albiglutide 30 mg (< 50 mg) once weekly. The cutoff point of the baseline BMI and weight loss was 32.5 kg/m² and 2.56 kg, which was the median of baseline BMI and weight loss. BMI indicates body mass index; CVOTs, cardiovascular outcomes trials; GLP‐1RAs, glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists; OR, odds ratio; and SC, subcutaneous.

Sensitivity Analyses and Publication Bias

The robustness of the results was explored by multiple methods. Different pooling methods to handle the zero‐events studies and use of random‐effects model did not change the results of DVT and PE (Table S4). When a single study was omitted one by one (Figures S22 through S24), the results of VTE, DVT, and PE remained stable. The cumulative meta‐analysis by year illustrated that the association between GLP‐1RAs and increased risk of DVT has been increasingly significant over time and remained stable after 2017 (Figure S25). No publication bias was identified by funnel plot and asymmetry tests for VTE, DVT, and PE (Figures S26 through S28).

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the association of GLP‐1RAs use with risk of VTE. Our findings suggest that GLP‐1RAs significantly increased the risk of DVT. It is noteworthy that the increased risk of DVT was particularly prominent among those treated with GLP‐1RAs > 1.5 years and CVOTs. No significant association was found between GLP‐1RAs and risk of PE.

To date, few preclinical and clinical studies have focused on the association between GLP‐1RAs and risk of DVT or PE. A previous publication reported a patient with type 2 diabetes suffering from cerebral venous thrombosis after using dulaglutide for 3 weeks and was experiencing nausea and vomiting. The authors speculated that dehydration due to dulaglutide‐associated nausea and vomiting was the provocative factor, which however could not be verified. Recently, a meta‐analysis of the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials investigated the safety profiles of semaglutide and intriguingly found that semaglutide was significantly associated with increased risk of DVT (6 RCTs with 13 339 participants included in the meta‐analysis, risk ratio [RR], 3.66 [95% CI, 1.09–12.25]) but not significantly associated with risk of PE (9 RCTs with 12 868 participants included in the meta‐analysis, RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.47–1.99]). However, only semaglutide was investigated, with a limited number of RCTs included. In contrast, all currently clinically used GLP‐1RAs and all eligible RCTs were comprehensively included in this meta‐analysis (39 RCTs with 70 499 participants included in meta‐analysis) to ensure systematic evaluation of association between GLP‐1RAs use and risk of VTE. We found a significant but weaker association (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.14–2.36]) between GLP‐1RAs and increased risk of DVT. Similarly, no significant association was identified between GLP‐1RAs and risk of PE. It is universally acknowledged that PE is the life‐threatening complication of DVT, and most PE was secondary to DVT. Previous investigations reported that among patients with confirmed PE, DVT was detected in 72% to 90% through autopsy and 71% to 93% by phlebography. However, the results varied widely from 10% to 80% using proximal ultrasound. Approximately one third of DVT cases progress to PE, with the risk of PE varying significantly depending on the location and size of the clot. Proximal DVTs (eg, in the iliac or femoral veins) and larger clots have a higher likelihood of embolizing and causing PE, whereas distal DVTs (eg, in the calf veins) and smaller clots have a lower risk of causing PE. This might explain the discrepancy between DVT and PE in this meta‐analysis. Regrettably, the RCTs included in our analysis did not provide detailed information on the location or size of DVTs. Future RCTs should report more specific details regarding the location and size of DVTs.

WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS

In rodents, semaglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether OZEMPIC causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) [see Contraindications (4)]. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of OZEMPIC and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with OZEMPIC [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### The effect of body mass index on the efficacy of semaglutide use at the time of total knee arthroplasty [^cfe2b9eb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study evaluated the impact of semaglutide on postoperative complications following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by body mass index (BMI) class.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of a national claims database was performed for patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis who had an active semaglutide prescription from January 2010 to April 2023. Patients were divided into non-obese (BMI < 30), obese (BMI 30.0 to 39.9), and morbidly obese (BMI > 40) groups. Semaglutide users were propensity score matched to non-users, yielding non-obese (7,402 versus 36,884), obese (4,034 versus 20,134), and morbidly obese (2,383 versus 11,853). Outcomes included 90-day medical complications, 90-day readmissions, and 90-day and 2-year implant-related complications. Univariate and multivariate regressions compared outcomes within BMI groups.

Results

In the non-obese group, semaglutide users had significantly lower odds of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (odds ratio (OR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.81; P < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; P < 0.001), and pneumonia (PNA) (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89; P = 0.004). In obese patients, semaglutide users had significantly lower odds of 90-day periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76; P < 0.001), 2-year PJI (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; P < 0.001), 90-day revisions (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85; P = 0.008), DVT (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; P < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.62; P < 0.001), and PNA (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.90; P = 0.008). In morbidly obese patients, semaglutide use was associated with significantly lower rates of 90-day aseptic loosening and myocardial infarction (both P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our findings support a BMI-based approach to perioperative semaglutide use, particularly in patients who have a BMI > 30.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Inform patients that semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents and that the human relevance of this finding has not been determined. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Acute Pancreatitis

Inform patients of the potential risk for acute pancreatitis and its symptoms: severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting. Instruct patients to discontinue OZEMPIC promptly and contact their physician if pancreatitis is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Diabetic Retinopathy Complications

Inform patients to contact their physician if changes in vision are experienced during treatment with OZEMPIC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Never Share an OZEMPIC Pen Between Patients

Advise patients that they must never share an OZEMPIC pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Introduction

The popularity of branded semaglutide is surging, with widespread media coverage, viral social media exposure, and celebrity endorsements. Although Wegovy (Novo Nordisk) is approved for long-term weight management, Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) (only approved for type 2 diabetes) is often used off-label for this purpose. Global regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, and World Health Organization (WHO), have warned about fake versions driven by patient demand, high cost, and shortages. Illegal online pharmacies, which operate without valid licenses and sell medicines like semaglutide without prescription, represent a consumer risk for ineffective and dangerous products.

Statistical Analysis

To identify the association of GLP‐1RAs use with risk of outcomes, odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% CIs were pooled by fixed‐effects models with the Mantel–Haenszel method, and treatment arm continuity correction was applied to deal with the zero events. The heterogeneity was assessed by Q statistic and χ² tests (statistical heterogeneity was set at P value < 0.10). To test the robustness of the results, sensitivity analysis was conducted by multiple types of pooling methods(ie, exact method [exact inference for fixed effects meta‐analysis], Peto's method, Mantel–Haenszel without continuity correction, generalized linear mixed models, and random‐effects model) to adjust the sparse events and omitting specific studies. To assess potential modifying factors, we conducted an exploratory subgroup analysis and meta‐regression on the prespecified covariates. For continuous covariates (ie, treatment duration [using 78 weeks as a cutoff], baseline body mass index [using the median as a cutoff], weight loss [using the median as a cutoff]), both meta‐regression with the residual maximum likelihood method and subgroup analysis were used. For categorial covariates (ie, drug dose, treatment indications, types of control, types of trials, specific GLP1‐RA types), subgroup analysis was used. The high and low dose was defined as follows: high‐dose groups included liraglutide ≥ 1.8 mg once daily, subcutaneous semaglutide ≥ 1.0 mg once weekly, oral semaglutide ≥ 7 mg once daily, dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg once weekly, exenatide ≥ 10 μg twice daily, lixisenatide 20 μg (≥ 20 μg) once daily, and albiglutide ≥ 50 mg once weekly; low dose of GLP‐1RAs included liraglutide 0.6 to 1.2 mg (< 1.8 mg) daily, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 mg (< 1.0 mg) once weekly, oral semaglutide 3.0 mg (< 7.0 mg) once daily, dulaglutide 0.75 mg (< 1.5 mg) once weekly, exenatide < 10 μg twice daily, lixisenatide 10 μg (< 20 μg) once daily, and albiglutide 30 mg (< 50 mg) once weekly. We evaluated the publication bias using Egger's and Begg's asymmetry tests, as well as the funnel plots. We observed the development of evidence using a cumulative meta‐analysis. All the analyses were performed with meta package in R studio (version 4.3.1). Statistical significance was set as at a P value of < 0.05.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings suggest that GLP‐1RAs might increase the risk of DVT, especially for the long‐term use of GLP‐1RAs. These findings deserve our concerns regarding the risk of DVT attributed to GLP‐1RAs along with the increasingly widespread use of GLP‐1RAs and provide a reference for clinicians in prescribing GLP‐1RAs, which might aid in the continued development of clinical guidelines for the use of GLP‐1RAs. VTE events deserve more attention, and sufficient report should be encouraged in the future investigations.

14.2 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this trial, 3,297 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to OZEMPIC (0.5 mg or 1 mg) once weekly or placebo for a minimum observation time of 2 years. The trial compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between semaglutide and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,940 patients (58.8%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 353 (10.7%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 442 (13.4%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 562 patients (17%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. In the trial 453 patients (13.7%) had peripheral artery disease. The mean age at baseline was 65 years, and 61% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years, and mean BMI was 33 kg/m². Overall, 83% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (24%), hypertension (93%), history of ischemic stroke (12%) and history of a myocardial infarction (33%). In total, 98.0% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.6%.

5.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications

In a 2-year trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients treated with OZEMPIC (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (OZEMPIC 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (OZEMPIC 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.4 Never Share an OZEMPIC Pen Between Patients

OZEMPIC pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to OZEMPIC that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of OZEMPIC.

Potential Modifiers for the Association of‐With Risk ofand

The summary of subgroup analysis of association between GLP‐1RAs and risk of DVT was presented in Figure 3 and Figures S2 through S7, S9 through S15. As shown in Figure S8, the odds ratio for DVT in RCTs with a treatment duration longer than 78 weeks was consistently > 1, whereas the OR for DVT in studies with a treatment duration < 78 weeks was more variable and less certain. Based on these observations, we chose 78 weeks as the cutoff for subgroup analysis. Notably, GLP‐1RAs were found to significantly increase the risk of DVT when used for longer duration (≥ 78 weeks) (OR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.49–3.60]), which was not observed in those with shorter duration (< 78 weeks) (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.33–1.30]) (P for interaction = 0.002, Figure 5; Figure S9). More importantly, ORs > 1 were observed among all 12 RCTs with treatment duration > 1.5 years (78 weeks) without exception, suggesting a possible treatment duration threshold for the prominent increase of DVT occurrence. Intriguingly, GLP‐1RAs significantly increased the risk of DVT in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.36–3.49]), whereas we did not observe an increase in risk of DVT in non‐CVOTs (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.57–1.83]) (P for interaction = 0.047) (Figure S10). The modified effects of drug dose, types of GLP‐1RAs, baseline body mass index, weight loss, and type of control on the risk of DVT were not statistically significant (Figures S11 through S15). Similarly, a significantly increased risk of VTE was observed in participants with a treatment duration > 78 weeks (OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.80]), whereas no such increase was found in those with a treatment duration of < 78 weeks (OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.40–1.11]) (P for interaction = 0.01, Figure S2). A significant association with an increased risk of overall VTE was observed exclusively in those treated with albiglutide (OR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.03–3.99]) (Figure S5). In contrast, the subgroup analysis of PE did not observe significant subgroup difference (Figures S16 through S21).

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of OZEMPIC in the pool of placebo-controlled trials. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on OZEMPIC than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with OZEMPIC.

Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials Reported in ≥ 5% of OZEMPIC-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials and in the 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1.

In a clinical trial with 959 patients treated with OZEMPIC 1 mg or OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly as add-on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea treatment for 40 weeks, no new safety signals were identified.

In the FLOW trial [see Clinical Studies 14.3] in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, safety data collection was limited to serious adverse events and selected predefined categories of adverse events regardless of seriousness. There were no new serious or severe adverse reactions identified in this trial.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving OZEMPIC than placebo (placebo 15.3%, OZEMPIC 0.5 mg 32.7%, OZEMPIC 1 mg 36.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation. More patients receiving OZEMPIC 0.5 mg (3.1%) and OZEMPIC 1 mg (3.8%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of venous thromboembolism: a Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^2f67f060]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on the association of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) with the risk of venous thromboembolism. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between GLP-1RAs and the risk of venous thromboembolism including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.

Methods and Results

A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane library was conducted from inception until July 3, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials comparing GLP-1RAs with placebo or other anti-iabetic drugs, with reported data on DVT and pulmonary embolism. The primary outcome was venous thromboembolism, and secondary outcomes included DVT and pulmonary embolism. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed-effects models with Mantel-Haenszel method and treatment arm continuity correction for zero-event trials. A total of 39 randomized controlled trials involving 70499 participants were included. A nonsignificant upward trend in the risk of venous thromboembolism was observed among participants using GLP-1RAs (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94–1.50]). GLP-1RAs were significantly associated with an increased risk of DVT (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.14–2.36]); risk difference 25 (5–52) more events per 10000 person-years). Subgroup analyses revealed that increased risk of DVT was particularly prominent in randomized controlled trials with treatment duration > 1.5years (OR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.49–3.60]) and in cardiovascular outcome trials (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.36–3.49]). No significant association was observed between GLP-1RAs and risk of pulmonary embolism.

Conclusions

GLP-1RAs might increase the risk of DVT, especially for long-term use of GLP-1RAs. Clinicians should be aware of this potential risk when prescribing GLP-1RAs.

### The adverse effects associated with semaglutide use in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1e4b9db4]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our systematic review has multiple strengths. It is the first to systematically assess the adverse effects associated with semaglutide use in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events. The predefined methodology was based on PRISMA, our eight-step procedure by Jakobsen et al. TSA, and GRADE assessments. The comprehensive literature search, combined with the inclusion of a large number of trials, has increased the robustness of the review. The meta-analyses of mortality and myocardial infarction showed no signs of heterogeneity, enhancing our confidence in the validity of our findings. We increased the statistical power by including all trials that enrolled patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Our systematic review also has limitations. First, some of the included trials had short maximum follow-up time points (down to 15.5 weeks), while some of the larger trials had longer maximum follow-up time points (up to 47.5 months (mean)). Although we did not identify signs of heterogeneity in most analyses, these short and varying observation trial periods should be considered when interpreting our results. Meta-regression of SAEs revealed that age and body mass index may account for some of the observed heterogeneity. Second, we planned multiple outcome comparisons and adjusted our thresholds for significance according to the number of primary outcomes to control the risk of random errors. However, we did not adjust the thresholds for significance according to the total number of comparisons (i.e. secondary outcomes, exploratory outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses). Third, given the large number of specific serious adverse events reported in some trials (up to over 1700 different serious adverse events in one trial), we opted to meta-analyze serious adverse event data only if at least one trial in either the intervention or placebo group reported five or more events. This pragmatic choice was made to avoid conducting up to a thousand different meta-analyses that would not provide meaningful insights into the effects of semaglutide. However, this may lead to under-reporting of individual serious adverse events. Fourth, 27 out of 50 trials (54%) were assessed at high risk of bias. Although 84.4% of the participants were from trials at low risk of bias, the high risk of bias trials may have influenced the results. Finally, 44/50 (88%) of the included trials were supported by Novo Nordisk, the developer and producer of semaglutide. Due to the high quality of trial methodology, design, and adequate reporting, we did not downgrade the evidence due to the potential of for-profit bias. Nonetheless, Novo Nordisk's support should be considered when interpreting our results.

Table 3 — acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with obesity — diagnostic and treatment considerations include that patients with obesity often have electrocardiogram abnormalities and may have baseline elevated high sensitivity troponin measures, and echocardiography and nuclear cardiology may have technical limitations. Reports vary for outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in overweight and mild to moderate obesity, but severe obesity increases risk of early CABG complications and length of hospital stay, and with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) long-term mortality increases among patients with severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m²). Dose of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies may need to be adjusted, and cardiovascular disease events are reduced by anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide and by bariatric surgery.

The authors showed a reduced VTE risk in a population of people with diabetes who were treated with GLP1-RAs when compared with those treated with DPP4is. Although this conclusion should be interpreted with some caution because of the study design limitations, it should be considered a robust initial evaluation. Future research is needed to confirm this finding and should explore whether this treatment strategy effectively reduces VTE risk in a general population and should investigate the underlying mechanisms further.

Data Extraction, Risk of Bias, and Quality Assessment

The following data were extracted from the published articles, supporting information, andor the European Union Clinical Trials Register: first author, year of publication, clinical trial identifier, treatment duration, baseline characteristics of participants (sample size, age, sex, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c), interventions, controls, and outcomes of interest (the number of DVTs, PEs, and VTEs [calculated as the sum of DVT and PE cases]). The risk of bias of the eligible studies was assessed according to the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was assessed through the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework.

Definition of Outcomes

In RCTs, DVTs or PEs were reported as serious adverse events. We identified the outcomes based on the terms from Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.1. DVT and PE were captured with the preferred terms. The total number of VTE events was calculated as the sum of DVT and PE cases. We retrieved outcomes from the results of serious adverse events reported on. The primary outcome was VTE calculated as the sum of DVT and PE cases. The secondary outcomes were defined as DVT and PE, both of which were captured with the preferred terms directly.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^8f2908ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose and reduces body weight. All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mean 24-hour Plasma Glucose Profiles (standardized meals) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo

Insulin Secretion

Both first-and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with OZEMPIC compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo, fasting glucagon (8%), postprandial glucagon response (14 to 15%), and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration (12%).

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was similar to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate Versus Glucose Concentration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during Graded Glucose Infusion before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo and in Untreated Healthy Subjects

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady-state.

Risk of Bias and Quality of Evidence

The details of risk of bias of the included studies were presented in Table S3 and summarized in Figure S1. Most of the studies had low risk of bias or some concerns of bias across the 5 domains. As illustrated in Table 2, the quality of evidence for the risk of all the outcomes was rated as moderate because of some concerns on possible reporting bias (underreporting could not be excluded).

Summary of Findings for VTE, DVT, and PE in the Meta‐Analysis

Association Between‐and Risk ofEvents

We observed an increasing trend in the risk of VTE among participants using GLP‐1RAs; however, this increase was not statistically significant (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94–1.50]) (Figure 2; Table 2). Notably, GLP‐1RAs were associated with a significant increase in the risk of DVT compared with controls (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.14–2.36]; absolute risk difference 25 [5 to 52] more events per 10 000 person‐years) (Figure 3; Table 2). In contrast, the risk of PE (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.69–1.26]) showed no significant difference between the GLP‐1RA group and control group (Figure 4; Table 2).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of venous thromboembolism: a Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^84990a1a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Specifically, we investigate the dose–response relationship between GLP‐1RAs and the risk of DVT, highlighting a significant increase in DVT risk for those using GLP‐1RAs for 1.5 years or longer. This dose–response relationship offers stronger evidence supporting the potential causal link between GLP‐1RAs use and the increased risk of DVT and provides clearer guidance for clinicians when considering the use of GLP‐1RAs in patients, enabling more informed, individualized treatment decisions. Interestingly, ORs > 1 were not only observed in the pooled result of the 12 RCTs with treatment duration > 1.5 years but also universally observed in every individual RCT with treatment duration > 1.5 years. This finding deserves particular attention, indicating that the DVT risk attributed to long‐term use of GLP‐1RAs should be evaluated with more caution in clinical settings. A possible explanation is that the development of unprovoked DVT typically occurs over a longer period. Additionally, we found that GLP‐1RAs were significantly associated with increased risk of DVT both in the pooled analysis of the 6 CVOTs, and in the result of every individual CVOT. Compared with non‐CVOTs, CVOTs were characterized with larger sample size, longer follow‐up duration, and more comprehensive information regarding adverse events, which might partially explain the discrepancy between CVOTs and non‐CVOTs. More importantly, this might indicate that some reporting bias could not be completely excluded in non‐CVOTs, although the funnel plot and asymmetry tests did not identify publication bias. The possible reporting bias might underestimate the risk of DVT associated with GLP‐1RAs, which alerts the researchers and clinicians to pay more attention to increased risk of DVT attributed to GLP‐1RAs. Moreover, multiple sparse event correction methods including an exact method (exact inference for fixed effects meta‐analysis) were applied in this meta‐analysis to address the issue of rare events and yielded consistent results, which improves the accuracy of estimating treatment effects when events are infrequent, enhancing the statistical power of the analysis to provide more reliable and precise results.

### Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^30d0fbaa]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors could increase blood viscosity, which may further increase risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SGLT2 inhibitors and risk of VTE in patients with type 2 diabetes. We systematically searched electronic databases up to April 2019 to identify randomized trials that reported the events of VTE in SGLT2 inhibitors group and control group (placebo or other active antidiabetic drugs). The primary outcome was VTE, and secondary outcomes included deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. In total, 29 randomized trials involving 56 035 patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Incidence of VTE was not significantly different between SGLT2 inhibitors group and control group (128/32 038 vs 92/23 997), yielding an RR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.75–1.28). Similarly, null associations were observed in the subgroup analyses. Our cumulative meta-analysis demonstrated the stability of our overall result over time. There was no significant association between SGLT2 inhibitors and risk of both DVT (17 trials; 31/17 442 vs 15/10 930; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.60–1.89) and PE (19 trials; 56/26 118 vs 41/19 517; RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67–1.46). Low statistical heterogeneity and no evidence of publication bias were observed. Current evidence from randomized trials found no association between SGLT2 inhibitors and risk of VTE among patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and risk of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1f8e93d3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is an established risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Observational data suggest that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may reduce the risk of VTE. However, the effects of GLP-1RAs on VTE have not been tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Objectives

To investigate the impact of GLP-1RAs on VTE risk using data from RCTs.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs focusing on GLP-1RA use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity. Five databases were searched from inception to October 2024. The primary outcome was VTE, which was a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and VTE at other sites, and the secondary outcomes were the individual events.

Results

Twenty-seven RCTs with 84,003 patients were analyzed. The median incidence of VTE was 1.1 and 2.5 per 1,000 patient-years in the GLP-1RA and placebo groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall VTE risk between GLP-1RA and placebo groups (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46–1.07). However, GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of PE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39–0.94). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the risk of DVT (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67–2.27) or VTE at other sites (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.25–1.26).

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis of randomized trials, GLP-1RAs were not associated with a significant reduction in overall VTE risk but were associated with a lower risk of PE among patients with T2DM or obesity.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of venous thromboembolism: a Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cede6602]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that the common gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea could result in dehydration, hemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity, important risk factors for DVT, might contribute to the association between GLP‐1RAs and increased risk of DVT. However, to date, in the absence of further experimental studies, no pathophysiological hypothesis can explain this potentially specific association between GLP‐1RAs and increased risk of DVT. The underlying mechanism of how GLP‐1RAs are involved in the development of DVT remains unclear. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to elucidate the potential effect of GLP‐1RAs on the development of DVT and the underlying mechanism.

Several strengths deserve to be mentioned for this study. First, this is the first meta‐analysis of RCTs systematically evaluating the association between GLP‐1RAs and risk of VTE. A further strength is the ability to identify granular data on adverse events from all studies in, providing confidence in event ascertainment. However, there are also some limitations for this study. First, DVT or PE events were not the predefined outcomes in these RCTs, so that the number of DVT or PE are likely underestimated. Second, given the low incidence of VTE in these RCTs, the study might be underpowered to detect that difference as significant. Third, considering that DVT or PE were not reported in quite a few trials, the potential publication bias cannot be fully excluded, although neither funnel plot nor statistical testing detected significant publication bias.

To date, the potential risk of VTE associated with GLP‐1RAs use remains largely unexplored. Given the severity of VTE and the increasingly widespread use of GLP‐1RAs, the public health impact of the excess risk of DVT deserves careful scrutiny and requires further investigation. Researchers should pay more attention and fully report VTE events in clinical studies regarding GLP‐1RAs and make them one of the predefined safety end points. More importantly, clinicians should carefully monitor patients who receive GLP‐1RAs and present with predisposing factors of DVT, especially for those who are expected to use GLP‐1RAs for a long period. Despite that GLP‐1RAs increased relative risk of DVT, the low incidence and small increase in absolute risk of DVT (25 cases per 10 000 people per year) should be weighed against the benefits of GLP‐1RAs in clinical practice.

Participants

Patients aged 18 years or older who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis and had been initially treated without interruption for 6 (range, 5.5 to 7) months with a vitamin K antagonist [target International Normalized Ratio (INR), 2.0 to 3.0] were eligible for inclusion. Unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis was defined as objectively confirmed symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis located in the popliteal vein or aboveoccurring in the absence of any major reversible risk factor for venous thromboembolism within 3 months before diagnosis and in the absence of active cancer or cancer resolved within less than 2 years prior to the diagnosis of the venous thromboembolism. Reversible risk factors included surgery with locoregional or general anesthesia lasting over 30 min, trauma with or without lower limb immobilization in a plaster cast, and bed-rest for more than 72 h. Estrogen-containing contraception (used by 6 women) was not considered as a major reversible risk factor. No deep-vein thrombosis was related to prolonged travel or hormone replacement therapy. All the index proximal deep-vein thromboses were objectively diagnosed using leg vein ultrasound.

The main exclusion criteria were: previous confirmed pulmonary embolism or proximal deep-vein thrombosis, concomitant symptomatic pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism or bleeding during the initial 6 months of anticoagulation, known major thrombophilia, indication for vitamin K antagonist therapy for reasons other than venous thromboembolism, increased bleeding risk, and life expectancy < 18 months (see the Online Supplement for the full list).

All participants were ambulatory patients enrolled in eight French hospital centers from July 13 th, 2007 to October 16 th, 2013 (last patient/last visit: December 31 st, 2016).

METHODS

All authors declare that all supporting data are available in the article, its online supplementary files or; the papers we included, and their supplementary files were found on online data bank (mainly PubMed).

We performed the systematic review and meta‐analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. The study protocol has been previously registered in PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; CRD42023450109).

Data Sources, Evidence Searches, and Identification

We comprehensively searched databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for RCTs of GLP‐1RAs with no restrictions on language up to July 3, 2024. The literature searches were conducted by 2 reviewers (Y.L. L.H.) independently (Table S1). We also manually screened additional gray literature in Google Scholar, the references of eligible studies and relevant reviews, and other resources.

Study Selection

Studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria (Table S2) were included: (1) RCTs investigating the efficacy or safety of GLP‐1RAs for adults > 18 years old with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, overweight, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or metabolic syndrome; and (2) the number of DVT or PE were reported. Studies including patients with type 1 diabetes, investigating coformulation of fixed‐dose combinations of GLP‐1RAs and other antidiabetic drugs (eg, IDegLira), with crossover design or post hoc analysis, or without non‐GLP‐1RAs comparators were excluded. Conference abstracts, reviews, and animal experiments were also excluded. When multiple articles reporting results from the same RCT, only the one with the most comprehensive data was included. The titles and abstracts of the literature were screened by 2 independent reviewers (Y.L. and L.H.) in the preliminary screening. Subsequently, full text of the potentially relevant articles was retrieved to confirm eligibility. The disagreement was resolved through discussion with 2 senior authors (H.Z. and Y.L.).

### Weighing the evidence on GLP1s and venous thromboembolism [^3dce2119]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Several choices around the study design should be highlighted to better understand the strength of the study conclusions. TTE is a technique that uses observational data to carry out a mock RCT and, in doing so, supports more causal interpretations than those that can be concluded from observational data while being more pragmatic and expeditious. With TTE, there are 2 key features, namely (1) the design is set up so that key elements used to describe the treatment effect are specified (population eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, treatment assignment from time zero, end points, outcome measures, etc), and (2) baseline confounders are accounted for to mimic randomization (herein, they used propensity score matching). Although this study provided a large population to help address the clinical questions, it also has inherent limitations related to the TriNetX database, namely data validity, coding practices, and completeness can vary across institutions and patients. For example, only 60% of patients in this study had available hemoglobin A1c and BMI data, and follow-up BMI data were not available to understand how the degree of weight loss might have influenced the findings. Despite propensity score matching, there may still be unmeasured variables that may explain why prescribers select certain medications over others, which, in turn, would affect the study outcomes.

With the important limitations of the study design noted, if the findings are replicated, this represents a potentially substantial off-target effect of the GLP1-RAs. Although it remains to be seen whether a similar VTE risk reduction might be seen in a nondiabetic population, the authors demonstrated a significant VTE risk reduction in both the nonobese and obese subgroups with risk reduced across all initial BMI categories. This study's results bring attention to older findings from the HOPE-3 and JUPITER RCTs that demonstrated a 47% reduction in VTE with rosuvastatin; it is intriguing to consider future possibilities of long-term nonanticoagulant treatments to reduce the primary or secondary risk of VTE. Important questions remain regarding the underlying mechanism of VTE reduction, namely is the reduction in VTE events related merely to the benefits of weight loss or something specific about VTE risk in diabetes or are there other mechanisms at play and could they be synergistic with the VTE reductions seen with statins? Could the solution to decreasing bleeding while preventing VTE lie outside of the coagulation cascade altogether? The broader impact of potentially reducing the incidence of VTE at a larger population level is also exciting to consider as GLP1-RAs are gaining widespread use for weight loss in people with obesity.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), may affect up to 900 000 patients per year, with over 300 000 deaths per year in the United States. The incidence has remained constant over the past 30 years and is increasing. DVT has been increasing with the age of the population – those 85–89 years old have an incidence as high as 310/100 000 population. Treatment costs run in billions of dollars per year and is increasing with the widespread adoption of the more expensive direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients aged 65 years and older and younger adult patients. In the CV outcomes trial, patients aged 75 years and older reported more fractures of the hip and pelvis on WEGOVY than on placebo. Patients aged 75 years and older (WEGOVY-treated and placebo-treated) reported more serious adverse reactions overall compared to younger adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the clinical trial in patients with MASH, of the 534 patients randomized to WEGOVY, 138 (26%) were aged 65 years and older and 13 (2%) were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of WEGOVY have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The recommended dosage of WEGOVY in patients with renal impairment is the same as those with normal renal function. In a study in patients with renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage of WEGOVY in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as those with normal hepatic function. In a study in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

3.4 Albiglutide

The clinical development programme for albiglutide included eight phase three trials with 2533 females, of whom 1242 received albiglutide, 190 received liraglutide and 1101 received comparators, including placebo. There were six pregnancies reported in the albiglutide group. Data on the number and outcomes of pregnancy in the comparator group were not reported in the FDA's clinical review, but one spontaneous abortion in the placebo group was reported on. Of the six pregnancies in the albiglutide group, three had no reported complications, one was terminated early, one was lost to follow‐up and one subject gave birth to a male with neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, transient tachypnea, and an abscess on the back and neck.

3.5 Dulaglutide

The clinical development programme for dulaglutide included ten trials with 2930 females, of whom 1872 females received dulaglutide, 120 received exenatide and 938 received placebo. There were nine total pregnancies reported in the clinical development of dulaglutide. Of these, seven received dulaglutide and two received placebo. There was one healthy child and one child born at low birthweight in the dulaglutide group. Among the seven other pregnancies, there were five healthy children and two elective terminations, but the exposure status of the mother was not reported.

3.6 Semaglutide

The clinical development programmes for semaglutide (brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Rebelsus) included 20 trials with 9736 females, of whom 5936 received semaglutide, 202 received liraglutide, 177 received exenatide and 3017 females received placebo. There were 53 pregnancies reported; 40 received semaglutide, one received exenatide and 12 received placebo. There were 22 healthy children, six spontaneous abortions, seven elective terminations, two lost to follow‐up, one congenital abnormality, one ectopic pregnancy and one ongoing pregnancy in the semaglutide group. The patient who received exenatide elected to terminate the pregnancy. In the placebo group, there were five healthy children, two congenital abnormalities, two elective terminations, one spontaneous abortion, one stillbirth and one lost to follow‐up.

Reporting safety data is beyond the scope of the current analysis; however, the safety profile of semaglutide in each SUSTAIN and PIONEER trial individually has previously been reported. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33

The limitations of our analysis include the low number of CV events and the short trial durations of SUSTAIN 6 (planned exposure 104 weeks and median follow‐up 2.1 years) and PIONEER 6 (median follow‐up 1.3 years) compared with other CVOTs. This resulted in small sample sizes and event numbers. Although findings from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER glycaemic efficacy trials support those of the CVOTs, the small number of events mean they should be interpreted with caution. Indeed, interpretation of subgroup analyses also requires caution, as our analyses (as with others discussed here) have not been controlled for multiplicity. There are additional limitations inherent to post hoc (versus prospective) analyses of randomized clinical trials.

4.5 Cardiovascular outcomes

Among 3183 patients with T2D and high CV risk enrolled in PIONEER 6, oral semaglutide was non‐inferior to placebo for the incidence of first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (3.8% in the oral semaglutide group and 4.8% in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [95% CI 0.57‐1.11], P < .001 for non‐inferiority). 40 A lower incidence of CV‐related death (HR = 0.49 [95% CI 0.27‐0.92]) and all‐cause death (1.4% vs 2.8%; HR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.31‐0.84]) was observed with oral semaglutide versus placebo. 40

In the other PIONEER trials, among patients at lower CV risk, the incidence of CV events between patients receiving oral semaglutide and those receiving placebo or other glucose‐lowering drugs was low. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 Fasting lipid levels (very low, low and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) remained similar or were reduced with oral semaglutide (generally at the 14 mg dose) versus comparators, and reductions were maintained over time. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44

3.2.2 Mental component summary

In the pooled treatment (semaglutide and placebo) analysis, the change in overall MCS score was 0.2 (SE: 0.2; 95% CI: −0.2, 0.5) from baseline to week 104 for all patients in the trial (Figure 1B). When analysed by the presence or absence of relevant factors, generally the mean MCS score was reduced from baseline in patients with the occurrence of MACE, hypoglycaemia or GI AEs during the trial, as well as in patients without HbA1c reduction ≥ 1% or without weight loss ≥ 5% at the end of the trial (Figure 1B).

5.5 Thrombosis

Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ at both 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily compared to TNF blockers in RA Safety Study 1 had an observed increase in incidence of these events. The incidence rate of DVT per 100 patient-years was 0.22 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.28 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.16 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of PE per 100 patient-years was 0.18 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.49 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.05 for TNF blockers [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA, PsA, or AS [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In a long-term extension study in patients with UC, five cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer.

Promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis and discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with symptoms of thrombosis.

Avoid XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. For the treatment of UC, use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

In a Phase II dose‐finding trial, oral semaglutide at doses of 2.5‐40 mg once daily demonstrated significant dose‐dependent reductions in glucose and body weight in patients with early T2D. 34 Oral semaglutide was well tolerated, and the main adverse events were GI‐related, which (in common with other GLP‐1RAs) mainly consisted of dose‐dependent, mild‐to‐moderate and transient nausea when initiating or titrating therapy. Fewer GI events were reported when patients started on a lower dose, suggesting that a gradual escalation could be a helpful mitigation strategy. 34 Based on the results of the Phase II trial, 34 oral semaglutide doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg were taken forward to the Phase 3 Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme, a series of 10 multicentre, randomized clinical trials.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^96598db7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The PIONEER programme was a robustly designed series of 10 clinical trials and established the premise of oral GLP‐1RA therapy. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Given that injections represent a barrier for some patients and health care providers, the availability of an oral GLP‐1RA should increase the number of eligible patients who receive this effective means of T2D management, and encourage use at an earlier stage. Thus, oral semaglutide addresses an important unmet need in the management of T2D.

In conclusion, the PIONEER programme demonstrated that the novel formulation of oral semaglutide was efficacious across the spectrum of T2D and more effective than comparators for glycaemic control and weight loss. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Tolerability was consistent with the known profile of GLP‐1RAs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Real‐world data will be required to confirm if the outcomes seen in the PIONEER trials are translated into clinical practice, and whether the availability of semaglutide in an innovative oral formulation will promote earlier and more frequent utilization of the GLP‐1RA class.

### Influence of preceding length of anticoagulant treatment and initial presentation of venous thromboembolism on risk of recurrence after stopping treatment: analysis of individual participants' data from seven trials [^6afea912]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications and conclusions

The clinical implications of our findings are that if patients with venous thromboembolism do not have an indication for indefinite anticoagulant treatment they generally should stop treatment at three months. As patients with a provoked isolated distal deep vein thrombosis who were treated for 1.0 or 1.5 months had a low risk of recurrence, and as extending treatment to three months did not seem to further lower this risk, our results suggest that the risk of recurrence will not be excessive if such patients need to stop anticoagulants before they have completed three months of treatment. Patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism had a high risk of recurrence whenever they stopped treatment; consistent with this observation, several studies suggest that these patients will often benefit from indefinite anticoagulant treatment. If patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism are not treated indefinitely, this analysis suggests that their risk of recurrence may be higher if they are treated for three months rather than six months (recurrent venous thromboembolism during the six months after stopping treatment in participants with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who were treated for three months compared with six months or longer: hazard ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 2.61; P = 0.08). However, as the increase in recurrent venous thromboembolism in the three month group was of borderline statistical significance, as we found no suggestion of a comparable increase in participants with provoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who were treated for three months rather than six months, and as this finding was one of many subgroup analyses, we cannot be certain that this was a true increase. Although extending treatment from three months to six months in such patients may reduce the subsequent risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, this potential benefit needs to be balanced against a higher risk of bleeding with, and the greater cost and inconvenience of, the longer duration of treatment. Elevated D-dimer concentrations during or after anticoagulant treatment seem to be a valuable predictor of recurrence in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism. This analysis was unable to assess if D-dimer or other laboratory variables were predictors of recurrence. If such factors improve identification of the subgroup of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can stop anticoagulant treatment because they have a low risk of recurrence, the results of this analysis suggest that treatment can be stopped after three months of anticoagulation.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^b93cda8e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

### Influence of preceding length of anticoagulant treatment and initial presentation of venous thromboembolism on risk of recurrence after stopping treatment: analysis of individual participants' data from seven trials [^33930bf0]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This analysis found that three months of anticoagulant treatment resulted in a similar risk of recurrence after treatment was stopped to a longer duration of treatment and that shortening treatment to 1.0 or 1.5 months doubled recurrence rates. Subgroup analyses suggested two possible exceptions to these overall findings. Firstly, patients with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis provoked by a temporary risk factor did not seem to have a higher risk of recurrence if they were treated for only 1.0 or 1.5 months. Secondly, patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism seemed to have a lower risk of recurrence if they were treated for six months or longer compared with three months. When a shorter course of treatment was associated with a higher rate of recurrence, this increase was confined to the first six months after stopping treatment.

The analysis also confirmed, and more precisely defined, that the risk of recurrence after stopping treatment is about double when venous thromboembolism is unprovoked compared with if it is provoked by a temporary risk factor; that the risk is about half after an isolated distal deep vein thrombosis compared with after either a proximal deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism; and that the rate of recurrence during the first six months of follow-up is about double the rate during the next 18 months. Patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer, who generally remain on anticoagulant treatment long term because they have a high risk of recurrence, were not included in the analysis.

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^1e392993]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To estimate the impact of semaglutide 2.4mg treatment on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with overweight/obesity in the United States based on the SELECT trial of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Materials and Methods

Using 2023 census projections and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we developed Markov population-based predictive models for US adults meeting SELECT inclusion criteria and, separately, for adults eligible for semaglutide 2.4mg for its MACE risk reduction indication. The 10-year rate of recurrent MACE and deaths was estimated based on the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease 2 risk calculator and estimated semaglutide 2.4mg treatment effect as per the SELECT MACE hazard ratio.

Results

Of 6164019 US adults meeting the SELECT criteria, 2523218 (40.9%) are estimated to have ≥ 1 new MACE in the next 10years with no additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg may prevent 496400 events, a 16% relative reduction. An estimated 2103630 deaths are predicted over the next 10years, of which 332597 deaths (any cause, 16% relative reduction) could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4mg. Among the estimated 22653158 meeting the MACE risk reduction FDA label criteria, 42.7% could experience ≥ 1 new MACE; treatment could prevent 1934493 MACE and 1231295 deaths (16% relative reduction for both).

Conclusion

Four in 10 individuals in the United States meeting the SELECT criteria are estimated to experience a recurrent CV event without additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg can potentially prevent between half a million and up to 2 million MACE over the next 10years in the population meeting SELECT and MACE risk reduction eligibility.

Plain Language Summary

What is the context and purpose of this research study? More than 7 in 10 US adults have overweight or obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease. Semaglutide is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. A clinical study called SELECT found that semaglutide reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by 20% in adults with overweight or obesity and heart disease. What was done? Our research estimated how many people in the United States would meet the criteria for participation in SELECT, how many heart disease events they might have with regular medical care over the next 10 years, and how many could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in addition to regular medical care. We also estimated how many people would still be alive if they were treated with semaglutide. We estimated the same information for all people eligible for treatment with semaglutide based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with heart disease. These estimations were based on a large survey of US adults. What were the main results? We found that over 6 million people would meet the SELECT study criteria. Of these, 41% are estimated to have at least 1 new heart disease event in the next 10 years. If treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 500 000 heart disease events and more than 300 000 deaths could be avoided. More than 22 million adults would qualify for semaglutide 2.4 mg, according to the FDA indication. If all of these people were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 2 million heart disease events and more than 1 million deaths might be prevented. What is the originality and relevance of this study? Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg can reduce the risk of new heart disease events and death in patients with existing heart disease, showing a substantial impact of semaglutide treatment in a real-world setting in the United States. Our study used different analyses to add to the existing research about reducing the risk of heart disease in people with overweight or obesity.
