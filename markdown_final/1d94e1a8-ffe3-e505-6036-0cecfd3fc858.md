## Question

First treatment for social anxiety

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base and how to rank interventions. Then, I should verify adult versus pediatric guidance because recommendations differ by age. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy between cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs, including durability and tolerability. After that, I need to consider access, delivery formats, and patient preference. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note special populations and nonresponders, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions. Multiple high-quality network meta-analyses and contemporary guidelines converge on the same conclusion: individual CBT has the strongest and most consistent evidence for adult social anxiety disorder, with large effect sizes versus waitlist and superiority to psychological placebo, while SSRIs are the most consistently supported pharmacologic option for those declining psychotherapy or when combined care is needed [^e0909146] [^2efc2b01] [^b3e434db].

> Wait, let me verify the adult-first-line recommendation precisely. The Lancet network meta-analyses and NICE-aligned syntheses conclude that individual CBT should be offered as the initial treatment of choice for adults with social anxiety disorder, with SSRIs reserved for patients who decline psychological treatment or as part of combination care, given CBT's larger effect sizes and better durability with fewer adverse effects than medication monotherapy [^e0909146] [^2efc2b01] [^7dadaefb].

> I should confirm the pharmacologic alternative and its magnitude of benefit. SSRIs and SNRIs demonstrate moderate effect sizes versus pill placebo in adults, with sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and escitalopram supported by randomized trials and regulatory labeling; however, relapse risk is higher after discontinuation and side effects such as sexual dysfunction and activation symptoms are common, so shared decision-making is essential [^b3e434db] [^9b1883cc] [^6e95f9ec] [^d465f176].

> Hold on, I should verify durability and maintenance because that influences first-line choice. Psychological interventions, especially CBT, show better maintenance of gains after treatment ends compared with pharmacotherapy, which often requires ongoing medication to sustain response; this durability advantage strengthens the case for starting with CBT when feasible [^2efc2b01] [^d465f176].

> Next, I should review pediatric guidance because it differs meaningfully. For children and adolescents, CBT is the first-line treatment and medication is not routinely offered as initial therapy; if pharmacotherapy is used, SSRIs are the first-line class, and combination CBT plus sertraline can be considered for severe, impairing cases, with careful monitoring for adverse effects and behavior activation [^fcc63207] [^7faf44c0] [^c86a7d8c].

> Let me consider access and delivery formats, since availability shapes real-world first-line choices. Face-to-face individual CBT is ideal, but therapist-guided internet-delivered CBT achieves comparable outcomes with far less therapist time, and digital CBT has been validated in youth as well, expanding access when in-person care is limited [^28bdb5b3] [^2140db70] [^2ecdca1f].

> I need to ensure I address patient preference and comorbidity because they guide sequencing. Guidelines emphasize aligning treatment with patient preference, and in the presence of significant depression, substance use, or when rapid symptom control is needed, starting with an SSRI or using combination treatment may be reasonable; conversely, in patients prioritizing durable skills and avoidance of medication side effects, CBT alone is preferred [^b3e434db] [^7dadaefb].

> But wait, what if first-line treatment fails or is declined. For adults not responding to an adequate SSRI trial, switching within class or to venlafaxine, or augmenting with clonazepam can be considered, though benzodiazepines carry dependency and withdrawal risks; for partial responders, adding CBT to ongoing medication is a rational next step, and for CBT nonresponders, adding an SSRI can be considered, acknowledging limited head-to-head combination data in SAD [^2a9610d2] [^d465f176].

> I should double-check special populations and caveats. Benzodiazepines are not first-line due to dependence and withdrawal risks, beta-blockers are not effective for generalized social anxiety, and while mirtazapine may help some with comorbid anxiety, evidence in SAD is limited and not first-line; in autism spectrum disorder, adaptations of CBT and careful targeting of social-cognitive maintenance processes are areas of active development rather than established standards [^2ecdca1f] [^e310c044] [^9b1883cc] [^86db1386].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with the evidence. For adults, start with individual CBT when available, offering therapist-guided internet CBT if access is limited. If CBT is declined or unavailable, initiate an SSRI such as sertraline, paroxetine, or escitalopram with counseling on benefits, side effects, and the need for continuation. For severe impairment or urgent need, consider combination CBT plus SSRI from the outset. For youth, prioritize CBT and avoid routine initial pharmacotherapy, reserving SSRIs and combination treatment for select severe cases with close monitoring [^e0909146] [^b3e434db] [^fcc63207] [^7faf44c0].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Individual CBT is the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder in adults because it achieves large, clinically meaningful effects with better durability and fewer adverse effects than medication alone; SSRIs are the first-line pharmacologic alternative for those who decline psychotherapy or when combined care is indicated, with selection and monitoring tailored to comorbidity, side effects, and patient goals [^e0909146] [^5b9ce230] [^b3e434db].

---

The first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder is **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** [^e0909146], with **SSRIs as the first-line pharmacologic option** [^b3e434db] for patients who decline or cannot access CBT. CBT yields large, durable effects [^2efc2b01] and is preferred for its favorable risk–benefit profile [^2efc2b01]; SSRIs are effective [^9b1883cc] but have more side effects and relapse risk after discontinuation [^2efc2b01]. Combination therapy is reasonable for severe or refractory cases, and patient preference should guide the choice [^7dadaefb].

---

## Psychological treatments

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

- **Effectiveness**: CBT is the most effective first-line treatment [^e0909146], with large effect sizes (SMD ≈ −1.19 vs waitlist) [^5b9ce230] and sustained benefits at follow-up [^2efc2b01].
- **Mechanisms**: CBT targets fear of negative evaluation, self-focused attention, and avoidance via exposure, cognitive restructuring, and social skills training [^da9ec779].
- **Formats**: Individual CBT is most effective; group CBT and therapist-guided internet CBT are also effective alternatives [^e0909146] [^28bdb5b3].

---

### Other psychological therapies

- **Psychodynamic psychotherapy**: Effective but generally less effective than CBT; consider when CBT is unavailable or declined [^b801d485].
- **Mindfulness-based interventions**: Limited evidence; not superior to CBT for SAD [^da74f751].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

- **Effectiveness**: SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy [^b3e434db] with moderate effect sizes (SMD ≈ −0.44 vs placebo) [^e0909146] [^9b1883cc].
- **Agents**: Paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and fluvoxamine have robust evidence [^6e95f9ec] [^363cf5ac] [^380bd6f6] [^1e201752].
- **Limitations**: Side effects (sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms) and relapse risk after discontinuation are common [^2efc2b01] [^d465f176].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Venlafaxine is effective [^b3e434db] and may be used when SSRIs are not tolerated or ineffective [^notfound].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are **effective short-term** [^9b1883cc] but are not first-line due to dependence, sedation, and withdrawal risks; reserve for short-term use or augmentation [^4e15097d].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

CBT has **larger, more durable effects** than SSRIs, with lower relapse after treatment ends [^2efc2b01] [^d465f176]. SSRIs act faster but have more side effects and relapse risk [^2efc2b01] [^d465f176]. Head-to-head trials show CBT and SSRIs have similar short-term efficacy, but CBT's effects persist longer [^2ecdca1f].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity and chronicity**: Severe or chronic SAD may benefit from combined CBT + SSRI [^7faf44c0].
- **Comorbidities**: SSRIs are preferred when depression or other anxiety disorders are present [^b3e434db].
- **Patient preference**: Strongly influence adherence and outcomes; shared decision-making is essential [^b3e434db].
- **Access and availability**: Internet-delivered CBT expands access when face-to-face CBT is limited [^28bdb5b3] [^2140db70].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

NICE recommends **individual CBT as first-line**, with SSRIs for those declining CBT or when combined treatment is needed [^7dadaefb]. AACAP recommends CBT as first-line for youth, with SSRIs or combination therapy for severe cases [^fcc63207] [^7faf44c0]. APA guidelines endorse CBT and SSRIs as first-line treatments, with selection tailored to patient factors [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| CBT (individual) | First-line | High |
| SSRIs | First-line pharmacotherapy | High |
| CBT (group) | Alternative | Moderate |
| Internet-delivered CBT | Alternative | Moderate |
| SNRIs (venlafaxine) | Second-line | Moderate |
| Benzodiazepines | Short-term or augmentation only | Low |

---

CBT is the **preferred first-line treatment** for social anxiety disorder because of its large, durable effects and favorable safety profile; SSRIs are the first-line pharmacologic option for patients who decline or cannot access CBT, with treatment individualized to severity, comorbidity, and patient preference [^e0909146] [^b3e434db].

### A 2010 evidence-based algorithm for the pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder [^c357b462]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A growing evidence base on the management of social anxiety disorder has yielded many meta-analyses and guidelines on the pharmacotherapy of this clinically important condition. We aimed to update a pharmacotherapy algorithm for the treatment of social anxiety disorder that was developed to be concise and user friendly and that was addressed to the primary care practitioner in particular. The updated algorithm attempts to summarize succinctly the recent literature in this area, as well as to include the views of an international panel of experts with diverse experience. The algorithm comprises eight sequential steps, beginning with those focused on diagnosis and initiating treatment and ending with the management of the treatment-refractory patient.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy

Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, for which a treatment manual specifically for social anxiety disorder can be followed.

Psychological placebo

A psychological intervention that includes features common to most well-undertaken psychological therapies (ie, non-specific components of treatment) and that was designed as a credible intervention.

Self-help with support

Interventions (usually CBT based) that are delivered by book or computer with limited therapist support (eg, short meetings, email support, or phone calls). For the purpose of clinical trials, participants typically received clinical interviews at the beginning and end of treatment.

Self-help without support

Interventions (usually CBT based) that are delivered exclusively by book or computer. For the purpose of clinical trials, participants were interviewed at the beginning and end of treatment.

CBT = cognitive–behavioural therapy.

We limited the network meta-analysis to interventions that people with social anxiety disorder and clinicians might regard as first-line treatments because network analysis assumes that treatment effects are transferable across studies. Ideally, all trial populations included in the network meta-analysis could have been eligible for all the treatment options investigated. Clinically, people choosing a first-line intervention have a different set of treatment options compared with people choosing second-line interventions; there would be a high risk that the assumption of exchangeability would be violated by the inclusion of clinically heterogeneous populations (eg, people who had not responded to treatments assessed in other studies). We identified eligible interventions by reviewing published and unpublished studies and through consultation with clinicians and experts (including people with social anxiety disorder, pharmacists, psychologists, and psychiatrists). We included interventions rather than excluded them if some experts thought they could be used as a first-line treatment.

### Social anxiety disorder: recent findings in the areas of epidemiology, etiology, and treatment [^faf2a9df]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Social anxiety disorder is a common and chronic disorder that leads to substantial psychosocial impairment. The disorder occurs early in childhood, and is frequently comorbid with a variety of other psychiatric diagnoses like depression, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Given these serious implications of social anxiety disorder, early effective treatment is extremely important. Pharmacotherapy, with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and cognitive behavioral therapy are the first choice of treatments for social anxiety disorder. This paper reviews recent findings on the epidemiology, etiology, and treatment for social anxiety disorder, and highlights areas where future research should be directed.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^7dadaefb]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Data for cost-effectiveness and side-effects both affect choices, and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be reported elsewhere. Taking these factors into account, NICE recently concluded that individual CBT should be offered as the treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline individual CBT, a SSRI is recommended for people who would prefer drug treatment and CBT-based supported self-help is recommended for people who prefer another psychological intervention. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is recommended as a third-line option, and other drugs are recommended only for people who do not respond to initial treatments. Thus, NICE recommendations are consistent with the results of this study, which suggests that increased access to treatment would reduce disability and improve quality of life for people with social anxiety disorder.

### Therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy vs internet-delivered supportive therapy for children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^2140db70]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent childhood-onset disorder associated with lifelong impairment and high societal costs. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for children and adolescents with SADand is considered the first-line treatment in clinical guidelines. However, only approximately 10% of individuals with SAD have reportedly ever been in contact with a health care professional about their social fears, and few have received an effective treatment. Barriers to treatment access include low availability of trained therapists, high treatment costs, long distances to clinics, and the nature of the social anxiety symptoms themselves, which makes it difficult for the individual to seek help.

The digital revolution has brought great opportunities to increase access to evidence-based treatments for mental disorders. There is increasing support for the efficacy of technology-delivered CBT for anxiety disorders in youths, with effect sizes in the moderate to large range compared with waitlist controls. The efficacy of internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for adults with SAD has been well established, but only 1 large randomized clinical trial of ICBT for youths specifically targeting SAD has been conducted, comparing a generic ICBT program suitable for all childhood anxiety disorders and a SAD-specific ICBT program with a waitlist control. Both active treatments were significantly more effective than the waitlist control, but no significant difference was observed between the 2 active treatments. To our knowledge, no study evaluating ICBT for SAD has yet used an active comparator, which is essential to distill the true effect of a behavioral intervention beyond the effects of practitioner attention and frequent monitoring and reporting of symptoms. Furthermore, no formal health economic evaluations of ICBT for SAD in youths have previously been conducted. Cost-effectiveness analyses are important when evaluating new interventions to guide policy makers on how to best allocate resources. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided ICBT for youths with SAD compared with an active comparator. We hypothesized that ICBT would be more efficacious and cost-effective than the active comparator.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders [^ae6ec79a]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illness and include disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are both effective treatments for anxiety disorders, with efficacy between 60% and 85%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line pharmacologic treatment for GAD, PD, and SAD. Recommendations for treating pediatric and geriatric populations vary slightly, but first-line treatments remain the same. Recent advancements in the treatment of anxiety disorders are limited although research has discovered novel pathways, which may lead to additional treatment options in the future.

### Absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies for eight mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a5766c1b]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychotherapies are first-line treatments for most mental disorders, but their absolute outcomes (i.e., response and remission rates) are not well studied, despite the relevance of such information for health care users, providers and policy makers. We aimed to examine absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies across eight mental disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We used a series of living systematic reviews included in the Metapsy initiative (www.metapsy.org), with a common strategy for literature search, inclusion of studies and extraction of data, and a common format for the analyses. Literature search was conducted in major bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up to January 1, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials comparing psychotherapies for any of the eight mental disorders, established by a diagnostic interview, with a control group (waitlist, care-as-usual, or pill placebo). We conducted random-effects model pairwise meta-analyses. The main outcome was the absolute rate of response (at least 50% symptom reduction between baseline and post-test) in the treatment and control conditions. Secondary outcomes included the relative risk (RR) of response, and the number needed to treat (NNT). Random-effects meta-analyses of the included 441 trials (33,881 patients) indicated modest response rates for psychotherapies: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.39–0.45) for MDD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33–0.43) for PTSD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30–0.47) for OCD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33–0.43) for panic disorder; 0.36 (95% CI: 0.30–0.42) for GAD; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.29–0.37) for social anxiety disorder; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.23–0.42) for specific phobia; and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.15–0.36) for BPD. Most sensitivity analyses broadly supported these findings. The RRs were significant for all disorders, except BPD. Our conclusion is that most psychotherapies for the eight mental disorders are effective compared with control conditions, but absolute response rates are modest. More effective treatments and interventions for those not responding to a first-line treatment are needed.

### Randomized trial of cognitive behaviour group therapy and a mindfulness-based intervention for social anxiety disorder: preliminary findings [^da74f751]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have evaluated the possible efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, few trials have compared MBIs with a first-line treatment. This study evaluated the relative efficacy of an MBI adapted for SAD (MBI-SAD) to cognitive behaviour group therapy (CBGT) for SAD. Participants were randomized to 12 weekly group sessions of the MBI-SAD (n = 52) or CBGT (n = 45). Results revealed that CBGT fared better than the MBI-SAD in reducing clinician- and self-rated social anxiety severity. The difference between the MBI-SAD and CBGT exceeded the prespecified noninferiority margin for our primary outcome the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, but findings are inconclusive as the width of the confidence interval extended in both directions surrounding the noninferiority margin. The MBI-SAD compared favourably with CBGT in improving other indices of well-being (depression, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, social adjustment). Contrary to expectation, the MBI-SAD did not produce greater changes in mindfulness and self-compassion than CBGT. Overall, results confirm that CBGT is robust treatment for SAD and should be considered as first-line treatment.

### Social phobia: an update on treatment [^e33e89f3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Social phobia is a prevalent anxiety disorder that may be treated with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both. This article reviews the empirical evidence for these interventions and discusses new treatment developments. Active ingredients and mechanisms involved in the effectiveness of treatment are discussed. In addition, the elements of social phobia and its treatment that are similar to other anxiety and non-anxiety disorders are considered. Finally, it discusses future efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment for social phobia, including possible revisions to the diagnostic criteria that might be considered in the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as well as routine care and obstacles for dissemination.

### Anxiety disorders: a review [^b3e434db]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning.

Observations

Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.55 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.76 to -0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, -0.30 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39 [small to medium effect[[95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65]), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.

### Social anxiety disorder | NEJM resident 360… [^2ecdca1f]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2. Differential Diagnosis. A: Social anxiety disorder can be treated with psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The choice of treatment depends on the patient's preferences and on clinical judgment. Several methods of psychotherapy are available for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently regarded as the first-line treatment. In high-quality studies of CBT for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, response rates were between 50% and 65%, an outcome that was superior to placebo and wait-list control groups, for which response rates were between 7% and 15%. Remission rates with CBT were between 8. 8% and 36%. For adults who do not have access to face-to-face CBT, guided Web-based CBT may be an alternative. The efficacy of Web-based CBT has been reported to be similar to that of face-to-face CBT and is applicable in primary care settings.

Other types of psychotherapy are also used to treat social anxiety disorder, but there have been fewer studies of these treatments. A: Pharmacotherapy and CBT appear to have a similar efficacy for the short-term treatment of social anxiety disorder. The available head-to-head comparisons suggest that more immediate improvements are achieved with pharmacotherapy but that the effects of CBT are more enduring. Several medications have been used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are considered to be the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Response rates reported for the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine have been similar to those reported for SSRIs. Randomized trials have also supported the efficacy of benzodiazepines for social anxiety disorder.

However, benzodiazepines carry a risk of physiological dependency and withdrawal symptoms and are not recommended for patients with coexisting depression or a history of substance abuse. Tricyclic antidepressants are not considered to be useful in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Table 4. Pharmacotherapies for Social Anxiety Disorder and Performance Anxiety.

### Pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder (SAnD) [^9b1883cc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recognition is growing that social anxiety disorder (SAnD) is a chronic and disabling disorder, and data from early trials demonstrate that medication may be effective in its treatment. This systematic review is an update of an earlier review of pharmacotherapy of SAnD.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and identify which factors (methodological or clinical) predict response to treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR-Studies and CCMDCTR-References) to 17 August 2015. The CCMDCTR contains reports of relevant RCTs from MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and CENTRAL (all years). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We updated the search in August 2017 and placed additional studies in Awaiting Classification, these will be incorporated in the next version of the review, as appropriate.

Selection Criteria

We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy versus placebo in the treatment of SAnD in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (TW and JI) assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion for this review update. We extracted descriptive, methodological and outcome information from each trial, contacting investigators for missing information where necessary. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided) and undertook subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included 66 RCTs in the review (> 24 weeks; 11,597 participants; age range 18 to 70 years) and 63 in the meta-analysis. For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found very low-quality evidence of treatment response for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (number of studies (k) = 24, risk ratio (RR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.85, N = 4984). On this outcome there was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (k = 4, RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.75, N = 235), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) (k = 8, RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55, N = 1270), and the benzodiazepines (k = 2, RR 4.03; 95% CI 2.45 to 6.65, N = 132), although the evidence was low quality. We also found clinical response for the anticonvulsants with gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogues (k = 3, RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.20, N = 532; moderate-quality evidence). The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. We assessed tolerability of SSRIs and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine on the basis of treatment withdrawal; this was higher for medication than placebo (SSRIs: k = 24, RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.97 to 3.39, N = 5131, low-quality evidence; venlafaxine: k = 4, RR 3.23; 95% CI 2.15 to 4.86, N = 1213, moderate-quality evidence), but there were low absolute rates of withdrawal for both these medications classes compared to placebo. We did not find evidence of a benefit for the rest of the medications compared to placebo. For the secondary outcome of SAnD symptom severity, there was benefit for the SSRIs, the SNRI venlafaxine, MAOIs, RIMAs, benzodiazepines, the antipsychotic olanzapine, and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) atomoxetine in the reduction of SAnD symptoms, but most of the evidence was of very low quality. Treatment with SSRIs and RIMAs was also associated with a reduction in depression symptoms. The SSRIs were the only medication class that demonstrated evidence of reduction in disability across a number of domains. We observed a response to long-term treatment with medication for the SSRIs (low-quality evidence), for the MAOIs (very low-quality evidence) and for the RIMAs (moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found evidence of treatment efficacy for the SSRIs, but it is based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence. Tolerability of SSRIs was lower than placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low. While a small number of trials did report treatment efficacy for benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, MAOIs, and RIMAs, readers should consider this finding in the context of potential for abuse or unfavourable side effects.

### Does cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth anxiety disorders improve social functioning and peer relationships? [^ad9c78f2]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent anxiety disorders (ADs) contribute to impairment in social functioning and peer relationships, exacerbating anxiety and related difficulties. The extent to which the AD treatment with the strongest evidence-base, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), improves social functioning and peer relationships is unclear. In this article, we report results of the first systematic narrative review of this topic. Randomized clinical trials of CBT for child and/or adolescent ADs were included if they used at least one measure of social functioning or peer relationships as a treatment outcome. Sixteen studies met our inclusion criteria. From each study, we extracted the sample characteristics, treatment arms, social and/or peer outcome measures, and statistical findings. Results show that social functioning and/or peer relationships improved over time in the majority of studies, highlighting an important aspect of treatment efficacy beyond anxiety reduction. There were also several treatment-specific effects, but considerable variability across studies' samples, methods, and findings, makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about which specific treatments improve specific outcomes. We recommend next steps for research to reconcile these findings, including improved operationalization and standardization of social and peer outcomes, and research on treatment specificity and mechanisms.

### First-line pharmacotherapy approaches for generalized anxiety disorder [^3236a776]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) do not receive adequate treatment. Several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, azapirones, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, alpha(2)delta Ca++ channel modulators, and atypical antipsychotics are consistently beneficial in patients with GAD. Cognitive therapy is also effective as a first-line treatment. When individualizing treatment, drug dose ranges and side effect profiles need to be considered, as well as the patient's comorbid conditions. Doses may need to be reduced for elderly or medically ill patients or those taking other medications. Doses may need to be increased for refractory cases. Common comorbid conditions with GAD include depression, alcohol or drug abuse, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. In patients with significant depression, an antidepressant is more likely to succeed than a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. Remission is attainable but can take several months, and stopping medication increases the risk of relapse within the first year of initiating treatment.

### Pharmacological treatment of social anxiety disorder: a meta-analysis [^27caedb9]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of several medications in the treatment of social anxiety disorder but information regarding their relative efficacy is lacking. We compared the efficacy of medications systematically studied for the treatment of social anxiety disorder using meta-analytic techniques. The methodology included a database search of articles published between January 1980 and June 2001 and manual searches of bibliographies in published manuscripts. Trials were included if they reported outcome data on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) or a categorical measure of responder status. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted using intent-to-treat data. There was substantial heterogeneity across trials. The medications with largest effect sizes were phenelzine [effect size, 1.02; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.52–1.52], clonazepam (effect size, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.49–1.45), gabapentin (effect size, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.29–1.27), brofaromine (effect size, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38–0.94), and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; effect size, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.81). There were no statistically significant differences between medications or medication groups. However, formal methods of interim monitoring adapted for meta-analyses suggested strongest evidence of efficacy for SSRIs and brofaromine. Several medications are efficacious for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The stability of the SSRI effect size estimate in conjunction with other evidence for safety and tolerability and their ability to treat comorbid conditions supports the use of SSRIs as the first-line treatment. Direct comparisons of SSRIs vs. other promising medications deserve consideration.

### Treatment… [^46a19718]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Treatment PSYCHOLOGIC TREATMENTS Nonpharmacologic modalities should be the initial treatment for patients with mild anxiety. 4 to address the three categories of symptoms of GAD. 10, 11 Relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to decrease arousal. 11 Cognitive therapy helps patients to limit cognitive distortions by viewing their worries more realistically, enabling them to make better plans to manage their anxiety. In cognitive therapy, patients may be taught to record their worries, listing evidence that justifies or contradicts the extent of their concerns. 20 Patients also learn that "worrying about worry" maintains anxiety and that avoidance and procrastination are not effective ways to solve problems.
20.

A small number of studies have found that cognitive therapy is more effective than behavior therapy 21, psychodynamic psychotherapy 22 and pharmacotherapy, 23, 24 but more research needs to be conducted before the superiority of cognitive therapy is firmly established. 20 Patients with personality disorders, those with chronic social stressors and those who expect little benefit from psychologic treatments do not respond well to psychotherapeutic techniques for the treatment of anxiety. 25 Often, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are necessary. 26 family members can provide another perspective on the patient's problems. In addition, family members should be included in efforts to help the patient develop problem-solving skills and can also help decrease the social isolation of patients with GAD by providing structured activities to promote interaction with others and lessen rumination about problems.

Another source of structured activity includes day programs provided by community mental health centers. If substance abuse is prominent, the patient should be referred to a rehabilitation facility. Patients and their families can be referred to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America for further information about available resources. PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT Pharmacologic therapy should be considered for patients whose anxiety results in significant impairment in daily functioning. Study results have not revealed an optimal duration of pharmacologic treatment for patients with GAD. 27 While 25 percent of patients relapse within one month of discontinuing drug therapy and 60 to 80 percent relapse within one year, 16 patients treated for at least six months have a lower relapse rate than those treated for shorter time periods.
16. Antihistamines are not potent anxiolytics.

Although some antipsychotic drugs have sedating properties, they should rarely be used as therapy for patients with GAD.

### Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder: what does the evidence tell us? [^0992b866]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment goals for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are to reduce fear, avoidance, physical distress, disability, and comorbidity. This review illustrates some of the primary studies used to evaluate efficacy of treatments for SAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine are effective treatments. They have the additional benefit of being able to treat comorbid conditions. For people who do not respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, treatment options include benzodiazepines (clonazepam, alprazolam, and bromazepam), alpha2delta calcium-channel blockers (gabapentin and pregabalin), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide, although agents in this class are not available in the United States), antiepileptics (levetiracetam), and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine). The irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine can be considered an effective third-line therapy. Combination treatments may be beneficial, but more research is needed. Benefits of beta-blockers (propranolol and atenolol) are limited to performance anxiety. Botulinum toxin A may be an effective augmentation treatment option for severe axillary hyperhidrosis in patients with SAD. Studies show that patients with SAD who are maintained on paroxetine, sertraline, or clonazepam have a low relapse rate.

### The gut microbiome in social anxiety disorder: evidence of altered composition and function [^6c3c97f7]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric conditions with estimated lifetime prevalence rates as high as 13% reported in the United States and similarly high prevalence rates across Europe. The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition (DSM-V) describes SAD as a condition characterised by 'marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others'. These fears generally extend across a variety of situations, including social interactions (e.g. having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g. eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g. giving a speech). SAD typically begins early in life and tends to run a chronic, often lifelong, course. It is associated with serious functional disability and markedly reduced quality of life with up to 69% of sufferers experiencing another lifetime major comorbid disorder. In particular, SAD markedly increases the risk of subsequent depression which is associated with a poorer prognosis and greater risk of suicide attempts. Thus, timely intervention in this early-onset disorder has the potential to not only reduce substantial disability, but to markedly reduce the psychiatric disease burden later in life. Current first-line treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients fail to adequately respond to first-line pharmacotherapy and even fewer patients will respond to subsequent second-line treatments. In a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating augmentation and switch strategies for refractory SAD (defined as more than two unsuccessful adequate pharmacological treatment trials), only 46% of patients demonstrated a response to treatment, while only 21% of all patients achieved remission at the 12-week endpoint. Thus, there is a great necessity for an improved understanding of the neurobiological basis for this condition and the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. The microbiome-gut-brain axis may represent one such potential avenue for investigation.

### More than doubling the clinical benefit of each hour of therapist time: a randomised controlled trial of internet cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder [^28bdb5b3]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder (CT-SAD) is recommended by NICE (2013) as a first-line intervention. Take up in routine services is limited by the need for up to 14 ninety-min face-to-face sessions, some of which are out of the office. An internet-based version of the treatment (iCT-SAD) with remote therapist support may achieve similar outcomes with less therapist time.

Methods

102 patients with social anxiety disorder were randomised to iCT-SAD, CT-SAD, or waitlist (WAIT) control, each for 14 weeks. WAIT patients were randomised to the treatments after wait. Assessments were at pre-treatment/wait, midtreatment/wait, posttreatment/wait, and follow-ups 3 & 12 months after treatment. The pre-registered (ISRCTN 95 458 747) primary outcome was the social anxiety disorder composite, which combines 6 independent assessor and patient self-report scales of social anxiety. Secondary outcomes included disability, general anxiety, depression and a behaviour test.

Results

CT-SAD and iCT-SAD were both superior to WAIT on all measures. iCT-SAD did not differ from CT-SAD on the primary outcome at post-treatment or follow-up. Total therapist time in iCT-SAD was 6.45 h. CT-SAD required 15.8 h for the same reduction in social anxiety. Mediation analysis indicated that change in process variables specified in cognitive models accounted for 60% of the improvements associated with either treatment. Unlike the primary outcome, there was a significant but small difference in favour of CT-SAD on the behaviour test.

Conclusions

When compared to conventional face-to-face therapy, iCT-SAD can more than double the amount of symptom change associated with each therapist hour.

### Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium [^e65e3e4e]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past 21 years since the birth of SP into the diagnostic nomenclature, there have been significant gains in knowledge about effective pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacologic treatment, although good evidence shows efficacy of benzodiazepines; MAOIs; and anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence about the efficacy of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism for the potential utility of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas requiring further investigation. There has been a great deal of excitement about the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, demonstrating efficacy for fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Given that SP starts in childhood and adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group because early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs to be more investigation into what is required for social phobic individuals who obtain a good response to pharmacotherapy to move into full-remission status. Additional research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy of different drug classes and to develop an improved capability of predicting treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research is needed regarding treatment resistance. In most of the anxiety disorders that have been studied, combining CBT with psychopharmacologic treatment has shown little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodologic problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments together. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals who have had untreated SP all of their lives and are now presenting for treatment in their "golden years". The current established treatments need to be evaluated further in this geriatric population.

### Attention bias modification augments cognitive-behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^6b83c62b]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) is a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, since many patients remain symptomatic post-treatment, there is a need for augmenting procedures. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the potential augmentation effect of attention bias modification (ABM) for CBGT.

Methods

Fifty patients with SAD from three therapy groups were randomized to receive an 18-week standard CBGT with either ABM designed to shift attention away from threat (CBGT + ABM), or a placebo protocol not designed to modify threat-related attention (CBGT + placebo). Therapy groups took place in a large mental health center. Clinician and self-report measures of social anxiety and depression were acquired pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Attention bias was assessed at pre- and post-treatment.

Results

Patients randomized to the CBGT + ABM group, relative to those randomized to the CBGT + placebo group, showed greater reductions in clinician-rated SAD symptoms post-treatment, with effects maintained at 3-month follow-up. Group differences were not evident for self-report or attention-bias measures, with similar reductions in both groups. Finally, reduction in attention bias did not mediate the association between group and reduction in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Structured Interview (LSAS) scores.

Conclusions

This is the first RCT to examine the possible augmenting effect of ABM added to group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult SAD. Training patients' attention away from threat might augment the treatment response to standard CBGT in SAD, a possibility that could be further evaluated in large-scale RCTs.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2efc2b01]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

We were not able to investigate whether immediate treatment effects persist or diminish in the long term because most trials stopped at the end of treatment. Findings from studies that have addressed this issue, suggest that most people who respond to a SSRI will relapse within a few months if the drug is discontinued after acute treatment, and about 25% of people who respond to SSRI treatment and continue drug treatment will relapse within 6 months. By contrast, the effects of psychological interventions are generally well maintained at follow-up, and participants can continue to apply new skills and make further gains after the end of acute treatment. For this reason, and because of the lower risk of side-effects, psychological interventions should be preferred over pharmacological interventions for initial treatment.

This study has several limitations. There were only a few studies of moderate size for several included interventions, and some have only been tested by one or two research groups. We included a broad range of interventions, which varied in duration, and there might be unknown differences among participants in different trials. However, we did not identify any systematic differences in participant demographics or initial symptom severity. Direct and indirect results were consistent, which provides further support to the pooled results. Control conditions were heterogeneous and rarely described in detail. Future trials should more clearly describe what was intended and what was actually received by people in control conditions. Statistical power might have been limited because we used scores after treatment rather than the change in scores and because we calculated effects conservatively, estimating effects accounting for dropout (eg, using last-observation-carried-forward) where possible. Conversely, pairwise analyses of small studies sometimes overestimate effects compared with large studies. Uncertainty in mean effects (ie, large CrIs) suggests that more research would improve our understanding of how these treatments compare. Specifically, large trials that compare active interventions and independent replications would improve the precision of these estimates and increase confidence in their external validity. We included only outcomes at the end of treatment; trials comparing active interventions with controlled long-term follow-up would provide better evidence of sustained effects.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^e0909146]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Social anxiety disorder-a chronic and naturally unremitting disease that causes substantial impairment-can be treated with pharmacological, psychological, and self-help interventions. We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146.

Findings

We included 101 trials (13164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD -1.01, 95% credible interval [CrI] -1.56 to -0.45), benzodiazepines (-0.96, -1.56 to -0.36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; -0.91, -1.23 to -0.60), and anticonvulsants (-0.81, -1.36 to -0.28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD -1.19, 95% CrI -1.56 to -0.81), group CBT (-0.92, -1.33 to -0.51), exposure and social skills (-0.86, -1.42 to -0.29), self-help with support (-0.86, -1.36 to -0.36), self-help without support (-0.75, -1.25 to -0.26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (-0.62, -0.93 to -0.31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD -0.56, 95% CrI -1.00 to -0.11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (-0.44, -0.67 to -0.22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD -0.56, 95% CrI -1.03 to -0.11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (-0.82, -1.41 to -0.24).

Interpretation

Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit.

### Do clinically anxious children cluster according to their expression of factors that maintain child anxiety? [^6ee1b8b0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 6.5% of children worldwide. The mean age of onset is 11 years of age yet anxiety disorders often persist into adulthood and increase the risk of other psychopathologies throughout life. The high prevalence, persistence and impairment associated with childhood anxiety disorders highlights the need for effective interventions.

Currently, the recommended first line treatment for anxiety in pre-adolescents is typically a general form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that can be applied across a range of anxiety diagnoses (e.g.;). Such general forms of CBT typically target mechanisms that appear in adult maintenance models of anxiety (e.g.), which are thought to also play a role in maintaining anxiety in children, including negative thinking styles (in particular threatening interpretations of ambiguous information and low self-efficacy), abnormal physiological arousal, avoidance of feared stimuli and, in some cases, social communication deficits.

The effectiveness of general CBT is promising (59.4% recovery) when compared to waitlist controls (17.5%;) and there are fewer side effects when compared to pharmacotherapy. However, almost half of the children who receive CBT retain a diagnosis and, as such, there is clear room for improvement.

In order to improve treatment for children with anxiety disorders, it is necessary to understand the reasons why they are not effective for some children. A number of demographic and clinical characteristics have previously been associated with impaired outcomes (i.e. higher symptom severity, lower socio-economic status (SES) and comorbid diagnoses of other anxiety, mood and behavioral disorders;). However, it may also be the case that the mechanisms that are targeted in general forms of CBT are not appropriate for all anxious children. Indeed, the evidence for the presence of these mechanisms in childhood anxiety disorders is unclear. For example, negative thinking styles have not consistently been found amongst anxious youth in comparison to non-anxious youth, particularly when samples are restricted to pre-adolescents. Furthermore, although avoidance of feared stimuli is often associated with anxiety in children it is not always required for a diagnosis (e.g. in social anxiety disorder where enduring with distress may be an alternative to avoidance;)

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^ad51f1e7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines cover the range and aims of treatment for anxiety disorders. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision making in primary and secondary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and their carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting involving experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines were constructed after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence for recommendations was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of anxiety disorders and key steps in clinical management, including acute treatment, relapse prevention and approaches for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments.

### Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-related disorders: a meta-analysis of recent literature [^4ca663ac]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are highly disabling and have a significant impact on patient's quality of life, relationships, occupational, and social abilities. In addition, such disorders contribute to enormous economic and public health costs. A recent report from the Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that more than 301 million people globally are affected by anxiety. A global return on investment analysis report indicates that approximately 12 billion workdays per year are lost due to anxiety and depressive disorders. Among the classifications of anxiety disorders, specific phobia (10.3%), panic disorders (6%), social phobia (2.7%), and generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) (2.2%) are the most common. In the current classification of anxiety disorders under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and posttraumatic disorder (PTSD) are no longer classified as anxiety disorders; however, they are highly comorbid with similar characteristics to anxiety symptoms such as irrational fear, avoidance and hyperarousal. Clinical guidelines recommend psychological and pharmacotherapy as a first-line treatment for anxiety-related disorders. Despite evidence for the efficacy of such interventions, a substantial proportion of patients receiving treatment still remain symptomatic.

### Guided and unguided internet-delivered psychodynamic therapy for social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^16d813cc]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked fear/anxiety or avoidance of social interactions as well as situations in which one is under scrutiny and/or the center of attention. Individuals suffering from SAD fear being negatively evaluated by others, humiliating themselves, being embarrassed, rejected or of offending others. To receive a diagnosis of SAD, this fear should also be out of proportion. SAD is a prevalent and disabling disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 4% globally. Although prevalence varies considerably between different countries, data suggests that SAD is a common mental health condition that typically debuts early in life and tends to persist over time. Furthermore, research suggests that the COVID–19 pandemic has led to elevated symptoms of social anxiety and that social distancing contributed to the maintenance of symptoms of social anxiety for many individuals.

### Paroxetine reduces social anxiety in individuals with a co-occurring alcohol use disorder [^315bf973]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with social anxiety disorder who are seen in clinical practice commonly have additional psychiatric comorbidity, including alcohol use disorders. The first line treatment for social anxiety disorder is selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine. However, the efficacy of SSRIs has been determined with studies that excluded alcoholics. Forty two subjects with social anxiety and a co-occurring alcohol use disorder participated in a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the efficacy of paroxetine for social anxiety in patients with co-occurring alcohol problems. Paroxetine was superior to placebo in reducing social anxiety, as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale total and subscale scores and additional measures of social anxiety. This study provides the first evidence-based recommendation for the use of an SSRI to treat social anxiety in this patient population.

### Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [^c86a7d8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Medication

There is some evidence that medication can be effective in treating anxiety in children and adolescents, at least in the short term. A recent meta-analysisshowed anxiolytic medication to be associated with a significantly greater clinical response than a placebo drug (58.1% vs 31.5%). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are regarded as the pharmacological treatment of choice for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents because of their effectiveness and safety profile. It is important to note that benzodiazepines have not been systematically evaluated in children and adolescents and, in view of concerns about dependency and side effects, their use is not recommended.

The relative effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people has been assessed in two trials. Beidel et al compared SSRIs to CBT in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents (7–17 years) and found CBT to be more effective than fluoxetine at the end of the treatment phase; however, Walkup et al in a sample of children and young people with a range of anxiety disorders, found no difference in outcome immediately after treatment between those treated with sertraline and those treated with CBT. Walkup and colleagues did, however, find the combination of sertraline and CBT to be more effective than either treatment alone. In the latter study, by 24 weeks after the end of acute treatment (with ongoing maintenance of sertraline or CBT booster sessions), there continued to be no significant differences between CBT and sertraline, although the advantage of the combined treatment had attenuated somewhat.

These recent findings suggest that CBT, sertraline and their combination are all possible options for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. However, several important questions concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in children remain unanswered. Thus, it is unclear if there is an age below which medication would be contraindicated; it is uncertain what the duration of treatment should be; and, most notably, it is unknown what the clinical consequences are of stopping a course of medication. As a result of these uncertainties, together with parental preference for psychological over pharmacological interventions for their children, the NICE guidelines for social anxiety disorderrecommend that medication should not be routinely offered to children and young people and that psychological treatment should be considered the first-line treatment. Although NICE is yet to report on the non-social forms of anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, there is nothing in the literature to suggest that their conclusion will be different concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in these other forms of anxiety disorder.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder [^cbcfe787]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Research on the treatment of SAD has progressed so that patients have a choice between two empirically supported modalities of treatment: (1) CBT and (2) pharmacotherapy. Current studies suggest that acute outcome for these treatments is approximately equal, or show subtle advantages for pharmacotherapy, but that CBT offers the advantage of strong maintenance of treatment gains and a relatively promising cost-benefit ratio. Despite this good news, there is concern that these modalities of treatment may be underutilized in clinical practice and that an informed choice of which modality of treatment to pursue may be limited by the availability of experienced cognitive-behavioral therapists who treat SAD.

### Establishment of remission criteria for anxiety disorders [^a8e59e28]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are typically chronic conditions associated with high health care costs and are often accompanied by psychiatric comorbidity, including major depressive disorder, substance abuse, and other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are associated with significant functional impairment in social, vocational, and familial spheres and with diminished overall quality of life. The following clinical overview provides informal guidelines for identifying remission in patients with an anxiety disorder. A systematic approach to treatment that includes patient education, encouragement of exposure, attention to relevant comorbidities, use of empirically proven pharmacotherapies, and psychosocial interventions of adequate intensity and duration will improve outcomes and move patients toward marked improvement and remission.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^5b9ce230]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Social anxiety disorder — a chronic and naturally unremitting disease that causes substantial impairment — can be treated with pharmacological, psychological, and self-help interventions. We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146.

Findings

We included 101 trials (13 164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD −1.01, 95% credible interval [CrI] −1.56 to −0.45), benzodiazepines (−0.96, −1.56 to −0.36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; −0.91, −1.23 to −0.60), and anticonvulsants (−0.81, −1.36 to −0.28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD −1.19, 95% CrI −1.56 to −0.81), group CBT (−0.92, −1.33 to −0.51), exposure and social skills (−0.86, −1.42 to −0.29), self-help with support (−0.86, −1.36 to −0.36), self-help without support (−0.75, −1.25 to −0.26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (−0.62, −0.93 to −0.31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD −0.56, 95% CrI −1.00 to −0.11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (−0.44, −0.67 to −0.22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD −0.56, 95% CrI −1.03 to −0.11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (−0.82, −1.41 to −0.24).

Interpretation

Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit.

### The pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders: a review of progress [^b08712ba]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders, as a group, are among the most common mental health conditions and frequently cause significant functional impairment. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic techniques are recognized to be effective management strategies. This review provides a discussion of the major classes of psychotropic medications investigated in clinical trials of the following anxiety disorders: panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Findings suggest that both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are useful first-line agents for most of the anxiety disorders, particularly given the frequent comorbidity with mood disorders. Highly serotonergic agents are preferred for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are generally reserved as second- and third-line strategies due to tolerability issues. Evidence for other agents, including anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics, suggests that they may have an adjunctive role to antidepressants in cases of treatment resistance, while azapirones have been used effectively for generalized anxiety disorder, and a substantial body of evidence supports benzodiazepine use in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite notable advances, many patients with anxiety disorders fail to adequately respond to existing pharmacologic treatments. Increased research attention should be focused on systematizing pharmacologic and combined pharmacologic-psychosocial strategies to address treatment resistance and developing novel treatments for anxiety disorders.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^da9ec779]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment implications by anxiety groups

The classification of anxiety disorders into fear-dominant, mixed, and anxiety-dominant groups directly informs treatment strategies (Table 1). International treatment guidelines provide consensus-based recommendations, emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment, followed by pharmacotherapy when necessary. The German guidelines for anxiety disorders recommend CBT as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as first-line pharmacological options. Benzodiazepines are discouraged due to dependency risks, while treatment-resistant cases may benefit from switching antidepressants or combination therapy. Similarly, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) clinical practice guidelines recommend CBT and SSRIs/SNRIs as standard treatments, with combination therapy considered for severe cases.

In the fear-dominant group (SP, AG), exposure therapy is highly effective. Gradually exposing patients to feared stimuli helps reduce exaggerated fear responses and avoidance behaviors. CBT, which involves exposure, is beneficial for SP but focuses primarily on the behavioral (exposure) component rather than on cognitive restructuring. For AG, CBT combines cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, helping patients challenge their fears and reduce avoidance. While SSRIs and SNRIs are not typically recommended for SP, they may be used to treat AG when comorbid with other anxiety disorders. However, some individuals remain resistant to standard treatments, requiring alternative therapeutic strategies.

In the mixed group (PD, SAD), CBT is the preferred treatment. It focuses on both exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. CBT has demonstrated strong efficacy across both PD and SAD, reducing avoidance and fear responses. In SAD patients, CBT is particularly effective in addressing fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. In PD, CBT helps patients correct catastrophic misinterpretations of panic symptoms and encourages gradual exposure to avoided situations. In addition to CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs serve as first-line pharmacological treatments, targeting both anticipatory anxiety and acute fear responses. However, residual symptoms persist in some patients, necessitating augmentation strategies and alternative interventions.

### A quality improvement project aimed at adapting primary care to ensure the delivery of evidence-based psychotherapy for adult anxiety [^165dd7d7]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Although primary care has become the 'de facto' mental health system in the USA, significant barriers exist when attempting to connect patients with evidence-based psychotherapy. A survey of over 1000 primary care patients with anxiety found that only 21% had received CBT. A 2012 review of over 100 meta-analytic articles concluded that CBT had the strongest degree of impact and efficacy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such that, it might be considered a reliable first-line therapy for anxiety.

Anxiety disorders are commonly found in primary care populations with prevalence estimates internationally ranging up to 31%.CBT for anxiety as delivered in primary care settings has shown the most robust results as compared with other short-term modalities. The primary care setting has advantages (eg, early treatment, reduced stigma) and disadvantages (eg, fast pace, diverse patient population) as a place for incorporating psychotherapy into practice. Efforts at incorporating evidence-based therapy into primary care have included a range of therapy approaches (eg, CBT, problem-solving therapy, supportive therapy) and various modes of delivery (eg, self-help, internet, education of primary care providers in CBT delivery). When compared with practice as usual and looking at multiple modes of delivery, there is overall support for the incorporation of evidence-based therapy into primary care as a cost-effective addition to services.

CALMwas the largest multisite, randomised controlled CBT trial in primary care for generalised anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CALM provided CBT directly within the primary care setting and demonstrated functional and symptomatic improvements in all disorders (excepting PTSD), along with a positive incremental net benefit in quality-adjusted life years.

### Childhood anxiety disorders and developmental issues in anxiety [^8bbab117]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are common disorders in childhood, and developmental differences must be considered when diagnosing and treating patients in this age group. Recent research has illuminated the course of childhood anxiety disorders, including how they can be precursors to continued anxiety and mood problems in adulthood. Recent studies of cognitive-behavioral therapy, the first-line psychosocial treatment for childhood anxiety, have focused on the following issues: the relative efficacy of group versus individual cognitive-behavioral therapy; the role of parent involvement; and the application of specific techniques to certain diagnostic groups (eg, social skills techniques in social phobia). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been associated with high acute response rates in controlled studies of children with anxiety disorders, and more recent evidence suggests they are efficacious and well tolerated when taken for longer periods. This article will review significant diagnostic and developmental issues, and highlight recent studies in psychosocial and pharmacologic therapies of pediatric anxiety disorders.

### Understanding social anxiety disorder in adolescents and improving treatment outcomes: applying the cognitive model of clark and wells (1995) [^cd7d0875]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018). Low credibility.

Improving Treatment Outcomes

In contrast to the limited evidence for treatment specificity in adolescents, substantial evidence for specific treatment effects has been observed in adults (Mayo-Wilson et al.), including CBT treatment based on the Heimberg model (Rapee and Heimberg). The version of CBT for adults that has the most evidence for treatment specificity is a specialised form of individual cognitive therapy, developed to target the cognitive abnormalities and maintenance processes specified in the Clark and Wells model of social anxiety disorder. Whilst there is overlap between this model and other cognitive behavioural models of social anxiety (Wong and Rapee) and the treatment has similarities to some other CBT approaches, many of the techniques are distinct. This can be seen in Table 1 which summarises what does and does not happen in cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder.

Table 1
Summary of what does and does not happen in cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder

Cognitive therapy based on the Clark and Wells has been compared to a number of other active treatments, and in the six randomized controlled trials that have been undertaken it has been shown to be superior to: Group CBT (Stangier et al; Mörtberg et al.), exposure therapy (Clark et al.), interpersonal psychotherapy (Stangier et al.), psychodynamic psychotherapy (Leichsenring et al.), fluoxetine (Clark et al.), medication-based treatment as usual (Mörtberg et al.) and pill placebo (Clark et al.). Therapy based on the Clark and Wells model is one of the two first-line treatments recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), an independent body that synthesises available research evidence to develop treatment guidelines [the other recommended treatment being individual CBT based on the Heimberg model].

Such consistent and broad evidence for treatment specificity is unusual and suggests that it might be profitable to investigate whether the Clark and Wells' model applies to adolescent social anxiety disorder as well as the adult condition. If the model does apply to adolescents, then a treatment that rather single-mindedly focuses on the maintenance factors specified in the model may be helpful for this population. Certainly, this type of approach, in which interventions are very tightly tied to known maintenance factors, has proved successful as a strategy for developing effective forms of CBT for a range of anxiety-related conditions in adults (Clark).

### Understanding mechanisms that maintain social anxiety disorder in autistic individuals through the clark and wells (1995) model and beyond: a systematic review [^86db1386]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024). Medium credibility.

A number of cognitive and behavioural models have been put forward to explain the persistence of SA (e.g. Clark & Wells; Rapee & Heimberg,) which share many common maintenance processes including negative social-evaluative cognitions including fear of negative evaluation from others, self-focussed attention, and a range of safety behaviours that include avoidance as well as wanting to escape the social situation (a detailed comparison across different social anxiety models have been summarised in a systematic review by Wong & Rapee). There has been a number of important efforts to develop interventions for social anxiety specifically in children and young people, a summary is provided by Mesa et al. which include a number of social skill based treatment programmes that largely focus on skill-building and use of exposure tasks to elicit changes in beliefs about oneself, social situations and other people, and also reduce social avoidance (Detweiler et al.). In this systematic review, we choose to focus on Clark and Wells model as it is one of the two theoretical models (the other being the Heimberg model (Rapee & Heimberg,) underpinning first-line of treatment for adults and recommended for children and young people by the Guideline Development Group (National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,), yet no studies to date have evaluated the extent to which empirical evidence support the extension and adaptation of this model to address co-occurring social anxiety amongst autistic individuals across the lifespan.

### Comparison of transdiagnostic treatment and specialized social anxiety treatment for children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^0a12f695]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric social anxiety disorder consistently shows the poorest treatment response of all anxiety disorders. The current study compared a generic cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for pediatric anxiety against a modified (social anxiety) treatment that incorporated specific components to target theoretically important maintaining processes.

Method

A total of 200 children and adolescents (mean age = 9.5 years, SD = 2.2 years; 47% boys) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as either their principal or additional disorder were randomly allocated to either the generic or the modified treatment. Both treatments were based on a manualized, empirically validated program (Cool Kids) and comprised 10 sessions over 12 weeks. Assessments comprised structured diagnostic interview and parent and youth reports, and covered diagnoses, symptoms, life impairment, and assessment of maintaining processes at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up.

Results

The treatments did not differ significantly on the primary outcome (remission of social anxiety disorder) at either posttreatment (remission in generic = 41%; modified = 44%) or follow-up (remission in generic = 51%; modified = 69%), although the latter approached significance (p = .08). They also did not differ at either time point on most secondary measures of outcome. The only maintaining process that changed more under modified treatment was attention to the current task.

Conclusion

Despite some positive hints in the data, there was little evidence that the modified intervention significantly improved treatment of pediatric social anxiety disorder, despite incorporating strategies to address putative maintaining mechanisms. The similar improvement between treatments on most maintaining processes suggests that new and innovative strategies may be needed to better target these processes.

### Social anxiety and agoraphobia symptoms effectively treated by prompt mental health care versus TAU at 6-and 12-month follow-up: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^e9149201]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

CBT is considered to be the first‐line treatment for both SAD and agoraphobia (Bandelow et al. 2015; Carpenter et al. 2018; Hans & Hiller, 2013; Hofmann et al. 2012; Mayo‐Wilson et al. 2014). Treatment effects and magnitude of effects are, however, still uncertain. First, only a few high‐quality trials have been conducted and these show lower effect sizes than low‐quality studies for both SAD and agoraphobia (Cuijpers et al. 2016). Second, most trials have used waitlist control groups, which also gain higher effect sizes than other control modes (Cuijpers et al. 2016). In sum, Cuijpers et al. (2016) did not find enough high‐quality studies to evaluate the effect of CBT compared to TAU for SAD in a 2016 review. Additionally, some evidence indicate that treatment effects are somewhat lower for SAD and panic disorder with agoraphobia than many other anxiety disorders (Carpenter et al. 2018) and agoraphobic avoidance is found to be the most consistent predictor of poor treatment response in CBT for panic disorders and agoraphobia (Porter & Chambless, 2015). Notably, also in an IAPT context, presenting with SAD or agoraphobia as a comorbid problem predicted poor treatment response (McDevitt‐Petrovic et al. 2019).

The objective in the current study is thus to do secondary analyses of the PMHC trial to investigate the effectiveness of the PMHC treatment compared to TAU among clients presenting with symptoms of SAD and/or agoraphobia on core symptoms at 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up. More specifically, the outcomes of interest are SAD avoidance and physiological discomfort, SAD cognitions, agoraphobic avoidance, and agoraphobic cognitions. We will also examine the characteristics of clients presenting with symptoms of SAD and/or agoraphobia as compared to PMHC clients in total.

### Cognitive behavior therapy for mental disorders in adults: a unified series of meta-analyses [^b8f91fdd]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for most mental disorders. However, no meta-analytic study has yet integrated the results of randomized clinical trials on CBT across different disorders, using uniform methodologies and providing a complete overview of the field.

Objective

To examine the effect sizes of CBT for 4 anxiety disorders, 2 eating disorders, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychotic and bipolar disorders on symptoms of the respective disorders using uniform methodologies for data extraction, risk of bias (RoB) assessment, and meta-analytic techniques.

Data Sources

Major bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for all disorders) were searched up to January 1, 2024, for each disorder separately. Data analysis was performed from August 2024 to January 2025.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing CBT with inactive control conditions in adults with 1 of the mental disorders established through a clinical interview were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Basic characteristics of patients, CBT, and studies were extracted. RoB was assessed with the Cochrane RoB tool 2. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (Hedges g) indicating the difference between CBT and controls at posttreatment on symptoms of the respective disorders.

Results

A total of 375 trials (423 comparisons) between CBT and controls were included among 32 968 patients. The overall mean (SD) patient age was 43.4 (13.7) years, and the mean (SD) proportion of women was 0.68 (0.24). Effect sizes for CBT compared to all control conditions (g) were lower than 0.5 for bipolar and psychotic disorder; between 0.5 and 1.0 for panic, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorders, depression, and OCD; and larger than 1.0 for PTSD and specific phobias (range of effect sizes: 0.31 for bipolar disorder to 1.27 for PTSD). Large effect sizes (g > 0.94) were observed in waitlist-controlled trials, a control condition mostly used in anxiety and eating disorders, PTSD, and OCD. Trials using care as usual showed more modest effect sizes (0.22–1.13). Study dropout rates within the CBT conditions ranged from 8% for specific phobia to 24% for PTSD.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this unified series of meta-analyses, CBT was probably effective in the treatment of mental disorders, including major depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, OCD, and eating disorders, and possibly effective in psychotic and bipolar disorders. However, the effect sizes depended on the type of control condition.

### Neural activation changes following attention bias modification treatment or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for social anxiety disorder [^4378460d]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD), which involves fear of situations where one may be scrutinized (American Psychiatric Association,), is common (Baxter, Patton, Scott, Degenhardt, & Whiteford; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters; Wittchen et al.) and impairing (Aderka et al; Stein et al.). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) pharmacotherapy is an efficacious first-line treatment for SAD (Curtiss, Andrews, Davis, Smits, & Hofmann; Davis, Smits, & Hofmann; Mayo-Wilson et al.), but many patients fail to respond to treatment (Blanco et al; Davidson et al.).

### Neuroinflammation mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies for anxiety and depression [^a5368fb1]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of anxiety and depression continues to increase. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobias, affecting 374 million people worldwide (4802 cases per 100,000 people). Depression, characterized by low mood, slowed thinking, and reduced volitional activity, affects 221 million people worldwide (3,152.9 cases per 100,000 people) in 2020. The Lancet estimated that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in an additional 53.2 million cases of major depressive disorder, which led to an increase in total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to 49.4 million, and 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorders, with total DALYs to 44.5 million worldwide in 2020. Symptoms of anxiety and depression often coexist, and comorbidity is associated with more severe symptoms, worse quality of life, greater recurrence, and higher suicide risk than either disorder alone. Despite the increasing incidence rates and heavy burden, the treatment effect for anxiety and depression is unsatisfactory. Conventional first-line treatment, including psychotherapy and medication, only achieves a 50% remission rate.

### Serotonin and dopamine transporter availability in social anxiety disorder after combined treatment with escitalopram and cognitive-behavioral therapy [^23f3afeb]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating and chronic psychiatric disorder associated with severe suffering for the individual, negative impact on working-life and relationships and high barriers to seek treatment. Existing treatments, predominantly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often successful and combining the two may further enhance clinical efficacy. Neuroimaging studies support that CBT, SSRIs, as well as combined treatment attenuate amygdala activity and connectivity during emotional conditions in SAD. Despite these advances, response rates for first line treatments are only 50–65%, indicating that many patients do not achieve remission. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy in SAD is therefore needed.

Serotonin has been implicated as a key neurotransmitter in the neurobiology of anxiety. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of serotonin synthesis capacity, serotonin 1A-receptor and transporter availability have suggested increased pre-synaptic serotonin activity in SAD patients and the beneficial effects of SSRIs further point to serotonergic involvement. The primary action of SSRIs is to block the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein that facilitates transmembrane reuptake of serotonin into the pre-synaptic cell and 76–85% occupancy has been suggested to exert efficient symptom relief. Adequate SSRI occupancy of the SERT has been verified in SAD. However, it is not clear if occupancy rate is linearly related to clinical SSRI responses. In a previous PET study, we failed to demonstrate such a relationship in SAD, consistent with several studies of major depression, although it has been observed for certain subpopulations of depression. Despite the well-characterized blockade of SERT by SSRIs, the anxiolytic mechanism of action is still debated. A number of downstream effects have been proposed to mediate the clinical effect, for example interactions with dopamine signaling.

### Evidence-based pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder: a revision of the 2005 guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^eaa82406]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

This revision of the 2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for the evidence-based pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders provides an update on key steps in diagnosis and clinical management, including recognition, acute treatment, longer-term treatment, combination treatment, and further approaches for patients who have not responded to first-line interventions. A consensus meeting involving international experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of supporting evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines are based on available evidence, were constructed after extensive feedback from participants, and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making in primary, secondary and tertiary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients, their carers, and medicines management and formulary committees.

### Pharmacotherapy for social phobia [^1e201752]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Social phobia (SP), or social anxiety disorder, is a prevalent and disabling disorder. There is growing evidence that SP is mediated by specific neurobiological factors, and increased interest in the use of medication in its treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for Social Phobia, and to determine whether particular classes of medication are more effective and/or acceptable than others in its treatment.

Search Strategy

Studies of the pharmacotherapy of SP were identified using literature searches of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003) and PsycLit (1966 to 2003). In addition, published and unpublished RCTs were requested from SP researchers and pharmaceutical companies and additional studies of any language were sought in reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs of the pharmacotherapy of SP were considered for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of selected RCTs was independently assessed by 2 raters on the CCDAN Quality Rating Scale, with the same raters collating data on treatment response and SP symptom ratings. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by medication class (SSRIs - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; MAOIs - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors; RIMAs - reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A), from which dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses undertaken.

Main Results

36 RCTs of a range of medications were included in the analysis (4268 participants), of which 26 were short-term (14 weeks or less). A funnel plot provided evidence of publication bias. Summary statistics for responder status (assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions scale change item (CGI-C)) from 25 short-term comparisons demonstrated superiority of various medication agents over placebo (relative risk of non-response (RR) = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.72; random effects model). Response to treatment by serotonin reuptake inhibitors (N = 11; RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.76), MAOIs (N = 3; RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.24, 0.76) and RIMAs (N = 6; RR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.91) supported the value of these agents. However, the SSRIs were significantly more effective than the RIMAs (Deeks' stratified test of heterogeneity (Deeks 2001): Qb = 29.82; p < 0.00001). Summary statistics for SP symptoms from 16 comparisons using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) showed a statistically significant difference between medication and placebo (weighed mean difference = -15.56, 95%CI = -17.95, -13.16), with this effect once again most evident for the SSRIs. Medication was also significantly superior to placebo in reducing SP symptom clusters, comorbid depressive symptoms, and associated disability. The value of long-term medication treatment in treatment responders was supported by 3 comparisons from maintenance studies (relative risk of non-response = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.85) and 5 comparisons from relapse prevention studies (relative risk of relapse = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.49).

Reviewers' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that medication can be effective in treating SP over the short term, with the strongest evidence of treatment efficacy observed amongst the SSRIs. Furthermore, the data support continued pharmacotherapy in medication responders over the longer-term. Nevertheless, the possibility of publication has to be acknowledged. Additional issues for future research include the use of medication in children and adolescents with SP, and in SP with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

### Social anxiety disorder in the primary care setting [^1a4f2692]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a disabling yet unrecognized condition for many individuals visiting primary care physicians. Social anxiety disorder carries a high risk of developing additional anxiety and mood disorders, including those with suicidal behaviors, as comorbidities, leading to a severe course. Screening and case-finding tools are available and can lead to the recognition of affected individuals. Once symptoms are recognized, an initial assessment will help to differentiate from other anxiety disorders and conditions that can be misdiagnosed as SAD. The primary care physician can manage treatment of SAD, which might require involving mental health professionals. Both pharmacotherapy, involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and psychotherapy, preferably with cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be effective. Long-term support strategies to monitor relapses or the development of additional psychiatric disorders or to provide anticipatory guidance at times of significant life transitions are additional primary care-based activities that can be helpful to the patient with SAD.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2e924b1a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

If a study reported continuous results for participants who completed the study only, as well as continuous results that accounted for missing data (eg, effects calculated using multiple imputation), we extracted the data that accounted for missing data. Studies reported several measures of social anxiety, none of which were common to all trials, so we calculated treatment effects for each study as a standardised mean difference (SMD). To reduce measurement error, we calculated the mean effect (Hedges' g) of all eligible scales for studies that reported more than one measure, taking between-scale correlation into account. For trials that reported only the change from baseline, the SD at baseline was used to ensure standardising constants were comparable across trials. Based on published psychometric properties and data from clinically referred participants who completed several measures (appendix A), we assumed that measures were equally responsive and had a mean correlation of 0.65.

Where reported, we also extracted data for recovery from social anxiety disorder (ie, no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) assuming that study dropouts had not recovered. We used the relation between continuous outcomes and recovery to estimate the treatment effect for all studies, including those that did not report recovery (appendix A).

We did a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis, which accounts for the correlation between trial-specific effects and random effects of trials with more than two arms. We analysed interventions by class (eg, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs and SNRIs]) and individually (eg, sertraline). In general, treatments with similar mechanisms of action were grouped in classes in which pooled effects were assumed to be similar. This grouping had the effect of drawing individual treatment effects towards the class mean. We used non-informative priors, except for the prior for within-class variability. Because there were few data to reliably estimate within-class variation, this prior was informative and was restricted with an inverse-gamma prior. This restriction limited variability to a clinically plausible range and had the effect of restricting the effect of outliers within a class; specific interventions with inconsistent results based on limited data would have otherwise had an undue effect on the results. For treatments not belonging to a class, we assumed no class variability and estimated only between-study heterogeneity. Combination interventions were included in a class because analysing of each combination as a distinct class would underestimate true variance (appendix A).

### Do comorbid social and other anxiety disorders predict outcomes during and after cognitive therapy for depression? [^673931a6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive therapy (CT) improves symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) plus comorbid anxiety disorder, but the specific type of anxiety may influence outcomes. This study compared CT outcomes among adults with MDD plus social, other, or no comorbid anxiety disorders.

Methods

Outpatients with recurrent MDD (N = 523, including 87 with social and 110 with other comorbid anxiety disorders) received acute-phase CT. Higher risk responders (n = 241 with partial or unstable response) were randomized to 8 months of continuation treatment (CT or clinical management plus fluoxetine or pill placebo), followed by 24 months of assessment. Lower risk responders (n = 49) were assessed for 32 months without additional research treatment. Depression, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance were measured repeatedly.

Results

Other (non-social), but not social, anxiety disorders predicted elevated depression and anxiety symptoms throughout and after acute-phase CT. Social, but not other, anxiety disorder predicted greater reduction in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT and elevated social avoidance during and after acute-phase CT.

Limitations

Anxiety disorders were assessed only before acute-phase treatment. The anxiety symptom measure was brief. Generalization to other patient populations and treatments is unknown.

Conclusions

Non-social comorbid anxiety disorders may reduce the efficacy of acute-phase CT for MDD by diminishing both short- and longer term outcomes relative to depressed patients without comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbid social anxiety disorder may increase relative reductions in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT for MDD, but patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder may require specialized focus on social avoidance during CT.

### Social anxiety disorder [^7209abdc]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Our understanding of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) has moved from rudimentary awareness that it is not merely shyness to a much more sophisticated appreciation of its prevalence, its chronic and pernicious nature, and its neurobiological underpinnings. Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder; it has an early age of onset — by age 11 years in about 50% and by age 20 years in about 80% of individuals — and it is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse. Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder, and genetic studies are increasingly focusing on this and other (eg, personality trait neuroticism) core phenotypes to identify risk loci. A range of effective cognitive behavioural and pharmacological treatments for children and adults now exists; the challenges lie in optimum integration and dissemination of these treatments, and learning how to help the 30–40% of patients for whom treatment does not work.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^c54dbcc8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with social phobia (social anxiety disorder) — Co-occurring social phobia may respond to the SRI used for OCD, though one small study found a poorer SRI response when social anxiety disorder co-occurred. Large, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies support the effectiveness of escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and clonazepam in treating social phobia. Phenelzine, while effective, cannot be combined with SRIs because the combination is likely to cause the serotonin syndrome, and controlled trials suggest social phobia also responds to cognitive-behavioral therapies.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of augmentation and switch strategies for refractory social anxiety disorder [^2a9610d2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Most patients remain symptomatic after an initial intervention with approved treatments for generalized social anxiety disorder. This randomized controlled trial provides systematic, prospectively derived data on the relative benefits of "next-step" pharmacotherapies to improve outcomes for individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder who remain symptomatic after initial treatment.

Method

This three site, 12-week, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the relative benefits of three strategies for patients remaining symptomatic (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale [LSAS] score > 50) after a 10-week trial of sertraline alone: the addition of up to 3.0 mg/day of clonazepam (sertraline plus clonazepam), a switch to up to 225 mg/day of venlafaxine, or prolonged sertraline treatment with placebo (sertraline plus placebo).

Results

A total of 397 participants received at least one dose of sertraline; 181 nonresponders (LSAS score > 50) at week 10 were randomly assigned to sertraline plus clonazepam, switch to venlafaxine, or sertraline plus placebo. Overall, 21% of patients achieved remission (LSAS score ≤ 30) at the endpoint, and 27% of patients assigned to sertraline plus clonazepam achieved remission compared with patients assigned to sertraline plus placebo (17%) or venlafaxine (19%), but the differences did not reach significance. Sertraline plus clonazepam was associated with a significantly greater drop in LSAS severity (p = 0.020) and disability (p = 0.0028) compared with sertraline plus placebo; no significant differences were observed on these parameters between venlafaxine and either sertraline plus placebo or sertraline plus clonazepam. In supplemental analysis, the overall response rate (LSAS score ≤ 50) was 46%, including a significantly greater proportion of patients in the sertraline plus clonazepam group (56%) compared with the sertraline plus placebo group responding (36%; p = 0.027); differences did not reach significance between venlafaxine and sertraline plus placebo or sertraline plus clonazepam.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that the clonazepam augmentation strategy provides relative benefits for sertraline nonresponders in social anxiety disorder.

### The nonpharmacologic treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^899e73dc]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article describes the latest nonpharmacologic therapies for generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, a review of available nonpharmacologic treatment outcome studies and studies that compare the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment is presented. The authors conclude that, of the nonpharmacologic therapies available, cognitive-behavioral therapy may be the preferred first-line treatment. Results of comparison studies have suggested that medication acts more quickly than does therapy in reducing symptoms, whereas therapy has more long-lasting effects. The authors recommend that further research be conducted in identifying the essential components of treatment and the most efficacious treatment combinations.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2bea92ed]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

All citations were screened by one author (KK or EM-W) who excluded citations that were not related to trials or to social anxiety disorder; potentially relevant citations were checked independently by a second author (EM-W or KK). Study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of biaswere extracted by one author (KK or EM-W) and checked independently by a second (EM-W or KK).

Randomised clinical trials of interventions for adults aged at least 18 years who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder were included. Studies that primarily focused on the treatment of comorbid disorders (eg, substance abuse) were excluded, but participants in the included studies often met criteria for another disorder (eg, depression) and were included. Eligible interventions were oral drugs (fixed or flexible doses), psychological or behavioural interventions (eg, promotion of exercise; panel), and combinations of interventions. Pharmacological interventions did not need to be licensed for social anxiety disorder, but interventions not used routinely in the treatment of social anxiety disorder, according to the consensus of the investigators and the NICE Guideline Development Group for the guideline Social anxiety disorder: recognition, assessment and treatment, were excluded (ie, exposure with a cognitive enhancer, surgical interventions, injected drugs, and antipsychotics). Studies of computerised cognitive bias modification were analysed in a separate review (unpublished). We excluded drugs that are no longer marketed (eg, brofaromine) if trials compared them only with placebo because these trials would not provide information about eligible interventions.

Panel
Definition of psychological interventions

Promotion of exercise

Behavioural change programmes that promote increased physical activity.

Exposure and social skills

Behavioural interventions that involve systematic exposure to social interactions or public speaking, but that do not include explicit cognitive techniques.

Group CBT

Therapist-led, group-based interventions that use both behavioural strategies (eg, exposure) and various cognitive strategies (eg, cognitive restructuring, video feedback, and attention training). Specific CBT manuals were followed for this intervention or the study investigators described the intervention as CBT.

Individual CBT

Individual interventions for which specific CBT manuals were followed or that were described as CBT by study investigators.

Other psychological therapy

Psychological therapies not included elsewhere were grouped to improve estimates of variance for the class model. This class includes the specific effects of interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness training, and supportive therapy.

### Augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) with D-cycloserine for anxiety and related disorders [^79e12cb5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the guidelines recommended by Cochrane.

Objectives

To assess the effect of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across different anxiety and related disorders.

Search Methods

This review fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB).

Main Results

Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the treatment of anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment responders, N = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; number of participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 91). There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality evidence for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. Although the observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a high efficacy of exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for clinical and methodological effect could not take place.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of effect in anxiety and related disorders.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^8c907a9e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression the largest cause of disability globally. Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together and the patient burden and complexity increases when both are present. Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with poorer chances of response to treatment, increased severity of depression and increased chance of suicide. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressants prescriptions increasingly yearly, with 67.5 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions on relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis, while a small study has shown promising anti-depressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder.

These trials did not, however, examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.

There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines around treating depression with comorbid anxiety. Most evidence-informed guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not offer any specific advice on treating comorbid psychiatric conditions or preferred augmentation agents. This issue is recognized by a recent guideline from the French Association for Biological Psychiatry: "Although the issue of comorbidity is recognized by evidence-based guidelines, few specific recommendations are provided regarding acute treatment with antidepressant drugs". This guideline, based on expert consensus, suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, NbN: SERT) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, NbN: SERT and NET) as first-line therapy for depression with any comorbid anxiety disorder, with mirtazapine recommended as a possible second-line agent.

### Recent trends in primary-care antidepressant prescribing to children and young people: an e-cohort study [^0337e1ac]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Implications

It may be useful to issue further guidance and support to GPs in relation to indications for effective antidepressant prescribing and to promote the recording of a diagnosis when issuing a prescription. Tricyclic antidepressants rather than SSRIs are the mainstay of neuropathic pharmacological pain treatment and are considered to be first-line drugs in adult practice (Gregoire & Finley). They are also used off-license in paediatrics, but without much published evidence. A Cochrane review (Kaminski et al.) failed to support their effectiveness in treating CYP's chronic pain. There are currently no published guidelines for neuropathic pain in children (Gregoire & Finley). Many GPs feel poorly equipped to manage young people's emotional distress and feel there is a lack of clarity (Roberts et al.). There are no specific NICE guidelines available for the management of anxiety in CYP. There are NICE guidelines for anxiety (which relate principally to adults; NICE,), depression for CYP (which includes mixed anxiety and depression; NICE, updated 2015) and for the assessment and treatment of social anxiety disorder (NICE). These all highlight some considerations for the management of anxiety in CYP. Psychological therapies should be the first line of treatment. Pharmacotherapy should not be routinely offered to treat social anxiety disorder in young people.

### Advances in pharmacotherapy for pediatric anxiety disorders [^e393bb5d]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The evidence base for psychopharmacologic interventions in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders has significantly increased, and our understanding of the relative efficacy and tolerability of interventions has expanded contemporaneously. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line pharmacologic treatment for pediatric anxiety due to their robust efficacy although other agents may have efficacy. This review summarizes the data concerning the use of SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, atypical anxiolytics (eg, 5HT 1A agonists, alpha agonists), and benzodiazepines in pediatric anxiety disorder cases (ie, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). The extant data suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are effective and well tolerated. SSRIs as monotherapy and SSRIs + cognitive behavioral therapy reduce symptoms in youth with anxiety disorders. However, randomized controlled trials do not suggest efficacy for benzodiazepines or the 5HT 1A agonist, buspirone, in pediatric anxiety disorder cases.

### Social anxiety and agoraphobia symptoms effectively treated by prompt mental health care versus TAU at 6-and 12-month follow-up: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^2874dbce]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and agoraphobia are two of the most common and disabling anxiety disorders. Their large negative impacts are related to high prevalence (Lecrubier et al. 2000; Remes et al. 2016; D. J. Stein et al. 2017) and early onset (Jones, 2018; Kessler et al. 2007), but also by their wide‐ranging associated impairment across several life domains, such as sleep, social/romantic relations, and occupational life (Aderka et al. 2012; Fehm et al. 2008; Lecrubier et al. 2000; M. B. Stein & Kean, 2000; D. J. Stein et al. 2017; Stuhldreher et al. 2014; Wittchen & Beloch, 1996), seen both in diagnostic threshold and subthreshold cases (Fehm et al. 2008). Moreover, both are associated with an elevated risk of developing other disorders, such as depression and alcohol/substance dependence (Lecrubier et al. 2000) and to follow a chronic course if left untreated (Bruce et al. 2005; Steinert et al. 2013; Wittchen & Beloch, 1996). Agoraphobia often occurs comorbid to panic disorder (Goisman et al. 1995), and these were conceptually linked in DSM‐IV whilst are coded separately in DSM‐5 (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2016). Despite their massive costs, both for the individual and society, anxiety disorders are often undetected in primary care (Kroenke et al. 2007) if at all seen, as individuals with SAD, in particular, tend to avoid seeking help (Lecrubier et al. 2000).

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^d465f176]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first time that psychological and pharmacological interventions for a mental health problem have been compared in network meta-analysis. The findings confirm that social anxiety disorder responds well to treatment, although many people continue to experience some symptoms after the end of the acute treatment phase.

Several classes of pharmacological and psychological intervention had greater effects on outcomes than did waitlist. Individual CBT and the class including SSRIs and SNRIs also had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebos, suggesting that they have specific effects. Psychological and pill placebo had greater effects than waitlist; investigation of these effects suggests that non-specific factors might account for about half the total effects of individual CBT and SSRIs. Comparisons between psychological interventions revealed some evidence of differential effects. In particular, individual CBT had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy and other psychological therapies (interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy). Many of the psychological treatments with large effects were versions of CBT (individual, group, or self-help), suggesting that CBT might be efficacious in a range of formats. Psychodynamic psychotherapy was also effective, although its effects were similar to psychological placebo.

Because pharmacological and psychological interventions were both efficacious, a logical question to ask is whether combined interventions might be more helpful than either intervention alone. Although large effect sizes were noted with combined treatments, only a few small studies were included, and there was no evidence that any combination was more efficacious than the leading pharmacological or psychological monotherapy in that combination.

There was little evidence of differential efficacy within or between classes of drugs. In the case of SSRIs and SNRIs, this finding is consistent with data from a previous network analysis, which showed no differences in efficacy but differences in tolerability. In the absence of convincing evidence for differential efficacy, differences in tolerability and side-effects are particularly important in the choice of treatment. SSRIs and SNRIs with a short half-life (eg, paroxetine and venlafaxine) are associated with the greatest risk of discontinuation effects, including effects during the treatment period and after the end of treatment. Some side-effects such as increased agitationand sexual dysfunctioncan be especially distressing for people with social anxiety disorder, particularly if these effects are unexpected or if they reinforce existing worries. These issues should be discussed with patients before starting drug treatment.

### Treatment of social anxiety disorder and attenuated psychotic symptoms with cannabidiol [^d9cb6702]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Anxiety disorders in young people are frequently comorbid with other mental disorders and respond unsatisfactorily to first-line treatment in many cases. Here, we report the case of a 20-year-old man with severe social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, insomnia and attenuated psychotic symptoms despite ongoing treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy and mirtazapine who was treated with adjunctive cannabidiol (CBD) in doses between 200 and 800 mg/day for 6 months. During treatment with CBD, he experienced subjective benefits to his anxiety, depression and positive symptoms during treatment that were confirmed by clinicians and by standardised research instruments. Findings from this case study add to existing evidence in support of the safety of CBD and suggest that it may be useful for young people with treatment refractory anxiety and for attenuated psychotic symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^e76feed8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AHRQ/Mayo review — scope and methods for treatments of child and adolescent anxiety disorders — The objective of the AHRQ/Mayo review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of specific child and adolescent anxiety disorders and to evaluate safety concerns, and it was made available in August 2017 with errata published in July 2018. To be eligible, studies included children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnoses of panic, social anxiety, specific phobia (including school phobia), generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, who received any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (alone or combined), and reported specified outcomes. Specified outcomes included primary anxiety symptoms from patient, parent, or clinician measures; secondary anxiety outcomes such as coping, avoidance, or anxious thoughts; global function; social function; satisfaction with treatment; response to treatment; and remission of the disorder. Both randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies were included for effectiveness outcomes, and case reports or case series were used to identify adverse events. The key questions were twofold, addressing the comparative effectiveness of treatments for these disorders and the general and potential harms of available treatments. The strength of evidence for each outcome and comparison (e.g., fluoxetine vs. CBT) was rated via a consensus process, with randomized controlled trials starting with high strength of evidence and observational studies starting with low strength, and initial ratings were then raised or lowered based on five additional domains: risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency, and publication bias.

### Antidepressant treatment duration in pediatric depressive and anxiety disorders: how long is long enough? [^2bce6206]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in the pediatric primary care setting, and respond to both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatment. However, there are limited data regarding the optimal treatment duration. This article systematically reviews guidelines and clinical trial data related to antidepressant treatment duration in pediatric patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. The extant literature suggests 9–12 months of antidepressant treatment for youth with major depressive disorder. For generalized, separation and social anxiety disorders, 6–9 months of antidepressant treatment may be sufficient, though many clinicians extend treatment to 12 months based on extrapolation of data from adults with anxiety disorders. Such extended treatment periods may decrease the risk of long-term morbidity and recurrence; however, the goal of treatment is ultimately remission, rather than duration of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Moreover, while evidence-based guidelines represent a starting point, appropriate treatment duration varies and patient-specific response, psychological factors, and timing of discontinuation must be considered for individual pediatric patients.

### Use of benzodiazepines in social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder [^4e15097d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are advantageous treatments for anxiety disorders because they work quickly. However, benzodiazepines can vary in terms of efficacy across anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines have been found to be a superior treatment in social anxiety disorder. While benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, other treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be more effective. Also, research indicates that benzodiazepines may not be effective in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Therefore, physicians need to consider the type of anxiety disorder before prescribing a benzodiazepine as a treatment.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Relative effects of CBT and pharmacotherapy in depression versus anxiety: is medication somewhat better for depression, and CBT somewhat better for anxiety? [^47785bb9]. Depression and Anxiety (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacotherapy is relatively more advantageous for depressive versus anxiety disorders.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis wherein we searched electronic databases and references to select randomized controlled studies comparing CBT and pharmacotherapy, with or without placebo, in adults with major depressive or anxiety disorders. The primary effect size was calculated from disorder-specific outcome measures as the difference between CBT and pharmacotherapy outcomes (i.e., positive effect size favors CBT; negative effect size favors pharmacotherapy).

Results

Twenty-one anxiety (N = 1,266) and twenty-one depression (N = 2,027) studies comparing medication to CBT were included. Including all anxiety disorders, the overall effect size was.25 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.55, P = 0.07). Effects for panic disorder significantly favored CBT over medications (.50, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.98). Obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar effects-sizes, though not statistically significant (.49, 95% CI: -0.11, 1.09). Medications showed a nonsignificant advantage for social anxiety disorder (-.22, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.06). The overall effect size for depression studies was.05 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.19), with no advantage for medications or CBT. Pooling anxiety disorder and depression studies, the omnibus comparison of the relative difference between anxiety and depression in effectiveness for CBT versus pharmacotherapy pointed to a nonsignificant advantage for CBT in anxiety versus depression (B = .14, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.43).

Conclusions

On balance, the evidence presented here indicates that there are at most very modest differences in effects of CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety versus depressive disorders. There seems to be larger differences between the anxiety disorders in terms of their relative responsiveness to pharmacotherapy versus CBT.

### Comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder [^9feea06b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.

### Treatment-resistant anxiety disorders [^77643e79]. Molecular Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Several epidemiological studies confirmed that Anxiety Disorders as a group are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the United States. The importance of these conditions is underlined by the fact that they cause significant disability, poor quality of life, alcohol and drug abuse. Anxiety disorders are treatable conditions and respond to the front-line interventions such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, only about 60% of patients respond to those treatments to any significant degree. Many still have residual symptoms or stay treatment refractory. The group of anxiety patients that is resistant to the treatment has been shown to have very poor quality of life and have highest rate of suicidal attempts than any other disorders. Many biological, treatment specific and social factors are affecting treatment resistance. In this paper, we are attempting to review reasons for the treatment resistance. In addition, we would like to review current strategies that could be helpful in reducing treatment resistance and aiding people chronically suffering from these severe and disabling conditions.

### Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [^01fd6190]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

The studies described above have typically included children with a range of anxiety disorders. This is partly driven by theoretical considerations, in that there are no well-validated diagnosis-specific models of the maintenance of disorder in children and young people; and partly for practical reasons, in that there is such a high level of comorbidity between the anxiety disorders. There has been some recent suggestion, however, that disorder-specific treatments may be associated with better outcomes for some disorders, especially social anxiety disorder. Indeed, a number of recent reports have noted that children and young people with social anxiety disorder do not make as substantial gains from generic treatment as those with other anxiety disorders. Correspondingly, recent meta-analyses have revealed better outcomes for young people with social anxiety disorder following disorder-specific compared to generic treatments. These 'specific' treatments have typically included the addition to generic treatments of social skills training and opportunities for peer interactions. There has been some interest in specific treatments for other conditions, such as specific phobiasand separation anxiety disorder. For separation anxiety disorder no clear advantage over generic treatments has emerged to date. For specific phobias, direct comparisons with generic treatments have not been conducted; however, some evidence suggests that taking an especially focused approach may allow for particularly rapid treatment. Thus, brief exposure-based treatment has been found to be effective compared to an active (education support) control, with 55% of children being free of their specific phobia after a single treatment session.

Considerations for good practice in the delivery of psychological interventions for children and young people with anxiety disorders

The recent NICE guidelines for the assessment and treatment of social anxiety disorderset out treatment principles for working with children and young people that apply well across the anxiety disorders. Specifically, it is noted that all interventions should be delivered by competent practitioners who receive regular, high-quality supervision that is informed by routine monitoring of treatment progress from each treatment session. The content of treatment should be based on relevant evidence-based treatment manuals, and adherence to these manuals should be monitored and evaluated in supervision, for example, using video or audio recordings of treatment sessions. Therapists should be aware of the potential impact of the child's home, school and wider social environment on the maintenance and treatment of anxiety disorders, so should work with the child or young person's parents, teachers or peers, as appropriate, to create an environment that supports the goals of treatment.

### Childhood social anxiety disorder: from understanding to treatment [^dc4cc652]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Childhood social anxiety disorder is a condition of complex origins. Longitudinal studies of shyness and behavioral inhibition, and twin and family history studies, support a genetic component, but experiences such as family environment, parenting, and traumatic conditioning also are observed. Many children with significant shyness and behavioral inhibition do not develop social anxiety disorder, reinforcing the need for longitudinal studies exploring resiliency and risk factors that can be incorporated into diathesis stress models. Efficacy data regarding cognitive and behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy are promising, and their effectiveness awaits further research. These studies will need to incorporate a multiplicity of perspectives to ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions for social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents.

### CBT for pharmacotherapy non-remitters – a systematic review of a next-step strategy [^34cc70d7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Non-remission rates to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders are related to higher relapse rates, decreased quality of life and greater functional impairment. Here we sought to investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as a next-step strategy in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit after a pharmacological intervention.

Method

We carried out a systematic review in the ISI, Pubmed and PsycINFO/PsychLit databases. Studies that did not use CBT and that did not focus on resistance to drug therapy were excluded. We considered resistant patients who failed to respond (did not fully remit) to an adequate trial of pharmacotherapy and still exhibited residual symptoms of anxiety disorder.

Results

We identified 603 references in our survey, of which 17 were included: eight were on OCD, five on panic disorder, and four on PTSD. No studies were found on social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. We observed a lack of standardization of terminology and of definitions of resistance, which makes comparison of results difficult. Finally, all of the identified studies showed benefits from the addition of CBT as a next-step strategy.

Limitations

A limited number of randomized controlled studies were found.

Conclusions

CBT seems to be a promising next-step strategy for patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit with drug-based therapies. However, further clinical trials with strong methodological designs are needed to definitely establish its efficacy in this population.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^b63745e4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications

Clarifying effective treatment for patients with treatment-resistance in primary care is key, as these patients are a common group that suffer from poorer quality of life, are harder to manage and utilize substantial healthcare resources. When depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur, they represent a more severe end of the population of depressed people. This is reflected in the baseline characteristics of participants in our high generalized anxiety group (GAD-7 ⩾16) who had higher baseline depression, rates of suicidal ideation and rates of struggling financially in addition to lower quality of life measures.

These results add support to existing evidence that mirtazapine is a useful treatment in managing generalized anxiety in those with depression. Additionally, this analysis suggests the possibility that this use of mirtazapine in those with severe generalized anxiety may improve both depressive symptoms and social functioning. This result was achieved by the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI, a strategy previous trials did not examine. These findings suggest a possible path to selectively targeting the addition of mirtazapine based on comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms when first-line treatment fails. This is in line with existing expert-consensus-based guidance on the use of mirtazapine in those with anxiety-predominant depression.

Conversely, these findings did not find any evidence for adding in mirtazapine in those without generalized anxiety symptoms, who have failed to respond to first-line antidepressant therapy. This is important, given the increase in prescriptions of antidepressants, to identify groups where antidepressants fail to work, in addition to those in whom they might be effective.

### Predictors of response to pharmacotherapy in social anxiety disorder: an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled paroxetine trials [^27d8516a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that patients with social anxiety disorder (social phobia) respond to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Response rates to SSRIs in social anxiety disorder have ranged from at least 50% in controlled trials to up to 80% in open trials. To date, however, there has been little information available about predictors of response to treatment in this disorder.

Method

Data from 3 placebo-controlled multicenter trials of paroxetine in DSM-IV social anxiety disorder (N = 829) were analyzed using logistic regression to determine predictors of response. Demographic (age, sex), physiologic (baseline heart rate, baseline mean arterial pressure), clinical (baseline social anxiety symptom severity, baseline disability, duration of illness), and trial variables (paroxetine dose, treatment duration) were included.

Results

Only duration of treatment was a statistically significant predictor of treatment response. Further analysis demonstrated that, in paroxetine-treated patients in particular, many nonresponders at week 8 (46/166; 27.7%) were responders at week 12.

Conclusion

These data demonstrate that paroxetine is a reasonable choice of treatment in a broad spectrum of patients with social anxiety disorder. An optimal trial of medication should continue beyond 8 weeks.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^b6afda95]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety disorders guideline — CBT implementation and quality measurement considerations emphasize that CBT should be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobia, or panic disorders, and describe CBT as a diverse group of interventions targeted at the three primary dimensions of anxiety: cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic. Treatment is characterized by collaboration among the patient, family, and therapist, and, in some cases, school personnel, with the goal of structured CBT to achieve meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement within 12 to 20 sessions. Systematic assessment of treatment effectiveness using standardized symptom rating scales can supplement the clinical interview, as their use has been shown to optimize therapists' ability to accurately assess treatment response and remission, and specialized education, training, and experience are necessary for the effective delivery of CBT.

Results

Main effect of treatment on social anxiety symptoms

Self-reported social anxiety

As shown in Fig. 1, LSAS-SR scores from screening (LSAS-SR mean = 77.98, s.e. = 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 72.09, 83.86) did not change significantly to the first (Z = 0.78, p = 0.438) or second baseline (Z = 1.81, p = 0.071). As expected, LSAS-SR scores decreased markedly (B = –33.46, s.e. = 2.55, Z = 13.13, p < 0.001) to posttreatment (LSAS-SR mean = 44.52, s.e. = 3.00, 95% CI 38.64, 50.41). The within-group Cohen's d effect size for improvement (difference between the mean of screening, first and second baseline, and posttreatment) was large (d = 1.46; 95% CI 1.05, 1.87).

### Efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in 12-and 24-week treatment of social anxiety disorder: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study [^380bd6f6]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the pharmacological treatment of choice for the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The efficacy and tolerability of fixed doses of escitalopram were compared to those of placebo in the long-term treatment of generalised SAD, using paroxetine as an active reference. Patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of SAD between 18–65 years of age were randomised to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo (n = 166), 5 mg escitalopram (n = 167), 10 mg escitalopram (n = 167), 20 mg escitalopram (n = 170), or 20 mg paroxetine (n = 169). Based on the primary efficacy parameter, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score at Week 12 (LOCF), a significantly superior therapeutic effect compared to placebo was seen for 5 and 20 mg escitalopram and for all doses for the OC analyses. Further improvement in LSAS scores was seen at Week 24 (OC and LOCF), with significant superiority over placebo for all doses of escitalopram, and 20 mg escitalopram was significantly superior to 20 mg paroxetine. Response to treatment (assessed by a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score ≤ 2) was significantly higher for all active treatments than for placebo at Week 12. Clinical relevance was supported by a significant decrease in all the Sheehan disability scores, and the good tolerability of escitalopram treatment. It is concluded that doses of 5–20 mg escitalopram are effective and well tolerated in the short- and long-term treatment of generalised SAD.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^b1ab02e8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety and depression

Is the diagnosis correct?

A correct and complete diagnostic assessment is essential. We have evidence for what works for depressive and anxiety disorders (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for both, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for both (but probably just robust evidence for fluoxetine in depression) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression only), but no evidence that those same treatments work for other disorders/problems, for example, situational sadness. So, prescribers should ensure that diagnostic criteria are met.

Particular caution needs to be taken around personality disorders (in particular emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), also referred to as borderline personality disorder). We note that the diagnosis of personality disorders in adolescence is controversial, with some practitioners/researchers endorsing this diagnosis, and others using the term emerging personality disorder. Young people with EUPD or emerging personality disorder may appear to have depression during the first assessment, as they are most likely to present when their mood is low. A careful assessment is essential. If young people diagnosed with a depressive disorder do not respond to first-line treatment, the prescriber should go back and review the diagnosis and consider personality disorder/ emerging personality disorder (which tends to become more obvious the longer a young person is treated).

Are we addressing all the problems?

A complete diagnostic formulation is essential. Basic treatments aimed solely at depression or anxiety are unlikely to be effective if there are significant co-morbidities. For instance, if ADHD is causing educational failure, leading to low self-esteem, then this needs to be addressed alongside treatment for depression. Another example is when CBT for depression ignores the primary anxiety disorder, which is unlikely to lead to the resolution of the depression.

We must also address social factors that contribute to depression – for example, if a young person is being bullied and becomes depressed, an SSRI will not stop the bullying which makes them feel worthless. We must enquire about social factors and do our best to address them and revisit what social stresses there may be if a young person does not respond to treatment. One should bear in mind that young people may not disclose challenging events in their lives (particularly abuse) during the first assessment, but they may feel more comfortable with the practitioner in subsequent sessions.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^fcc63207]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety disorders guideline — cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) recommendation and evidence states: AACAP recommends (1C) that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) be offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobia, or panic disorder. Evidence included a total of 60 RCTs and 3 nonrandomized comparative studies compared CBT to waitlist/no treatment, 29 RCTs and one nonrandomized comparative study compared CBT to attention control/treatment as usual, and 3 RCTs compared CBT to pill placebo, with overall, 6,978 patients were included (47.9% male; mean age 11.2 years, range 6–18 years). Compared to inactive controls (waitlist/no treatment), CBT improved primary anxiety symptoms (child, parent, and clinician report), global function, and response to treatment (all moderate SOE), and may have improved remission of disorder (low SOE). Compared to active controls (attention control/treatment as usual), CBT improved only primary anxiety (child report) (moderate SOE); CBT did not separate from attention control/treatment as usual for primary anxiety (parent and clinician report), satisfaction, secondary measures, or remission of disorder (all low SOE), and there was insufficient evidence for global function, social function, and response to treatment. CBT did not separate from pill placebo for primary anxiety (child report) or secondary measures (all low SOE), with insufficient evidence for primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, or social function; except as noted, CBT did not separate from pill placebo, waitlist/no treatment, or attention control/treatment as usual with respect to any short-term AEs (all low SOE), while compared to pill placebo, CBT reduced dropouts (low SOE) and compared to waitlist/no treatment, CBT reduced dropouts due to AEs (low SOE). Additional support notes that this recommendation was supported by the findings from four meta-analyses, and one meta-analysis suggested the possible superiority of group CBT over all other assessed psychotherapies and control conditions; the CQI Guideline Writing Group voted unanimously in favor of this recommendation.

### Probability and predictors of first treatment contact for anxiety disorders in the United States: analysis of data from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions (NESARC) [^0e4ac68f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and the demonstrated efficacy of their treatment, most individuals with anxiety disorders never utilize mental health services.

Objective

To identify predictors of treatment-seeking for DSM-IV anxiety disorders from a range of sociodemographic factors and comorbid mental disorders.

Design

Survival analysis with time-varying covariates was performed using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).

Setting

Face-to-face interviews conducted in the United States.

Participants

34,653 respondents, aged 18 years and older, from the 2004–2005 Wave 2 NESARC.

Main Outcome Measure

The cumulative probability of treatment-seeking (assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV version, Wave 2 version) across the anxiety disorders in 1 year, 10 years, and lifetime and the median delay to the first treatment contact.

Results

Most individuals with panic disorder sought treatment within the same year of disorder onset, whereas the median delays to first treatment contact for generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and social anxiety disorder were 1 year, 13 years, and 16 years, respectively. Several personality disorders and earlier age at anxiety disorder onset decreased the probability of treatment contact. By contrast, younger cohort membership, a recent change in marital status, treatment for a psychiatric disorder other than substance use disorder, and comorbid anxiety disorders increased the lifetime probability of treatment contact.

Conclusions

Treatment-seeking rates for most anxiety disorders are low, are associated with long delays, and sometimes are hindered by co-occurrence of other psychopathology. These patterns highlight the complex interplay of personal characteristics, individual psychopathology, and social variables in the treatment-seeking process.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^7faf44c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline — combination cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (recommendation 3) suggests (2C) that combination treatment (CBT and an SSRI) could be offered preferentially over CBT alone or an SSRI alone to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, two RCTs compared combination treatment to either treatment alone and these 2 studies included 550 patients (52.6% male; mean age 12.2 years, range 7–17 years). Compared to CBT alone and to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline improved primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), whereas combination CBT plus fluoxetine did not separate from CBT alone for global function, secondary measures, or response to treatment (all low SOE) and may have reduced remission of disorder compared to CBT alone (low SOE). For adverse effects (AEs), combination CBT plus sertraline did not differ from CBT alone with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all low SOE) but increased AEs related to behavior activation (moderate SOE) and increased any AEs and AEs related to sleep (both low SOE); compared to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline decreased AEs related to behavior activation and reduced AEs due to fatigue/somnolence (both moderate SOE), and insufficient evidence precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior. Because there were only two studies with conflicting results, the AHRQ/Mayo review did not find definitive evidence for the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy, yet expert consensus generally supports the prioritization of combination treatment; in CAMS, youths who received combination treatment had significantly higher rates of remission than monotherapy with SSRI or CBT or placebo at week 12 and week 24, and in clinical practice, combination treatment may be favored if there is a need for acute symptom reduction in a severe, functionally impairing disorder or a partial response to monotherapy. Combination treatment typically involves concurrent administration of psychotherapy and medication, optimally delivered in the same facility to enhance convenience and provider communication, and naturalistic follow-up (CAMELS) failed to demonstrate long-term maintenance of treatment effects by original randomized treatment while initial response — significantly superior in the combination treatment — was a strong predictor of long-term outcome.

### Cognitive functioning in youth with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^29759f5f]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are one of the most prevalent mental health disorders in children and adolescents (henceforth youth) with estimates ranging from 10 to 32% (Costello et al; Merikangas et al.). Anxiety disorders in youth are associated with an array of adverse outcomes, including impaired social functioning (Seeley et al.), impaired occupational and family functioning (Essau et al; Swan & Kendall,), academic underachievement and dropout (Van Ameringen et al; Woodward & Fergusson,), and decreased life satisfaction (Dooley et al.). Anxiety disorders are often theorized as disorders of thoughts or cognitions (Ingram & Kendall,), involving affective, physiological, and behavioral responses. Not surprisingly the first-line treatment for youth with anxiety disorders is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Higa-McMillan et al; Walter et al.), which places a focus on identifying thoughts as well as learning skills to manage fear and prevent avoidance behaviors (e.g. cognitive restructuring, problem solving, exposure; Gosch et al.).

### Optimising exposure for children and adolescents with anxiety, OCD and PTSD: a systematic review [^744c67b4]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety and related disorders 1 are among the most common and impairing mental health disorders in children and adolescents, with worldwide prevalence rates estimated at 6.5% (Polanczyk et al.). This is of particular concern as, if left untreated, childhood anxiety disorders can run a chronic course (Bittner et al; Broeren et al.), are associated with educational underachievement (Owens et al.), poor peer relationships (Asendorpf et al.) and poor social (Settipani and Kendall) and occupational (Swan and Kendall) functioning.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is typically the first-line treatment for child and adolescent anxiety disorders (e.g. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; World Health Organization). Although CBT is an effective treatment, approximately 41% of young people do not benefit (James et al.). Furthermore, a naturalistic follow-up study of anxious youth treated with CBT found that 48% of initial treatment responders relapsed following treatment (≤ 6 years) (Ginsburg et al.). Together these studies emphasise that although CBT for childhood anxiety disorders is beneficial, there is a clear need for improvement. The critical ingredient in CBT for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and young people appears to be behavioural exposure (Kendall et al; Peris et al; Peterman et al.), a controlled therapeutic technique that involves the person facing an anxiety-provoking stimulus or situation (Marks). The theoretical foundations and proposed mechanisms of change that guide behavioural exposure have important implications for how the exposure session is planned, conducted and appraised (Abramowitz).

### Understanding social anxiety disorder in adolescents and improving treatment outcomes: applying the cognitive model of clark and wells (1995) [^4d7d8c48]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018). Low credibility.

As well as traditional generic CBT, psychological therapies designed specifically for social anxiety disorder have been developed. Cognitive behavioural group therapy (CBGT; Albano et al.) was one of the first to be tested. This treatment, based on the Heimberg model (Rapee and Heimberg), involves psycho-education and skills training (social skills and anxiety management strategies) followed by exposure tasks (Albano and DiBartolo). In an early randomized controlled trial (RCT), CBGT was compared to no treatment amongst female adolescents (Hayward et al.). The authors note that whilst those in the CBGT group showed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety symptoms compared to the no treatment group post-treatment, they continued to report considerable residual symptoms and at one-year follow-up the control group had also improved and there was no longer a significant group difference. Herbert et al. did not find evidence for specific treatment effects of CBGT in an RCT comparing the treatment to an educational supportive therapy amongst adolescents, with both treatments associated with an improvement in social anxiety symptoms, functioning and social skills.

Social Effectiveness Therapy (SET; Turner et al.) and its parallel version for 8–12-year olds Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C; Beidel et al.) is another SAD specific treatment. It is a behavioural group treatment comprising psycho-education, social skills training and exposure. Baer and Garland adapted the treatment for adolescents and compared it to waitlist in a pilot RCT with 12 adolescents. SET-C outperformed waitlist based on clinician- and self-report of symptoms. Olivares et al. compared SET-C and CBGT to a waitlist control using a quasi-experimental design (participants were allocated to group according to their school timetables; random allocation was not used). Both active treatments yielded significantly better self- and clinician-rated improvements compared to waitlist with no differences between the two, and gains were maintained at 5-year follow-up (Garcia-Lopez et al.).

### Efficacy of sertraline in severe generalized social anxiety disorder: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^363cf5ac]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Generalized social anxiety disorder is an early onset, highly chronic, frequently disabling disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 13%. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for the treatment of severe generalized social anxiety disorder in adults.

Method

After a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, patients with DSM-IV generalized social phobia were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of sertraline (50–200 mg/day) or placebo. Primary efficacy outcomes were the mean change in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score and the responder rate for the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), defined as a CGI-I score ≤ 2. Data were collected in 2000 and 2001.

Results

211 patients were randomly assigned to sertraline (intent-to-treat [ITT] sample, 205), and 204 patients, to placebo (ITT sample, 196). At week 12, sertraline produced a significantly greater reduction in LSAS total score compared with placebo (mean last-observation-carried-forward [LOCF] change from baseline: -31.0 vs. -21.7; p = .001) and a greater proportion of responders (CGI-I score ≤ 2: 55.6% vs. 29% among week 12 completers and 46.8% vs. 25.5% in the ITT-LOCF sample; p < .001 for both comparisons). Sertraline was well tolerated, with 7.6% of patients discontinuing due to adverse events versus 2.9% of placebo-treated patients.

Conclusion

The results of the current study confirm the efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of severe social anxiety disorder.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^6e95f9ec]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Social Anxiety Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, as defined in DSM-IV (300.23). Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 12-week trials in adult patients with social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV). Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with social phobia (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

The effectiveness of paroxetine in long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to prescribe paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose comparison of paroxetine and placebo in the treatment of generalized social anxiety disorder [^92181b1a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out to determine the effectiveness and safety of various daily dosages of paroxetine for the treatment of generalized social anxiety disorder.

Method

A 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in was followed by 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. 384 eligible patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine, 20 (N = 97), 40 (N = 95), or 60 mg (N = 97), or placebo (N = 95) once daily in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Primary efficacy variables included mean change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score and proportion of patients exhibiting a therapeutic response (defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement scale [CGI-1] score of 1 or 2).

Results

In the last-observation-carried-forward analyses, patients treated with paroxetine, 20 mg/day, had significantly greater improvement on mean LSAS total scores compared with those receiving placebo (p < .001), while the incidence of responders, based on the CGI-I rating, was significantly greater with paroxetine, 40 mg/day, than with placebo (p = .012). Patients treated with paroxetine, 20 and 60 mg, also had significantly better responses on the social item of the Sheehan Disability Scale than did patients treated with placebo (p < .019). The completer analyses showed a significant difference between the placebo group and the 20-mg and 40-mg paroxetine groups on LSAS total score and rate of response (p ≤ .006). There were no serious adverse experiences attributed to paroxetine treatment.

Conclusion

Paroxetine, 20 mg/day, is an effective and safe treatment for patients with generalized social anxiety disorder and significantly improves social anxiety, avoidance of social interactions, social disability, and overall clinical condition. Further data analyses are needed to determine whether more specific guidelines for paroxetine dosage escalation in social anxiety disorder can be drawn.

### Beta-blockers for the treatment of anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e310c044]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker prescriptions for patients with anxiety increased substantially between 2003 and 2018, yet there is no clinical guidance concerning their use. A previous review of propranolol - a beta-blocker - in the treatment of anxiety concluded there was insufficient evidence to support its use. Additional data have been published in the eight years since that review including some evidence for other beta-blockers. We aimed to synthesise all available data on the effectiveness of beta-blockers in the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Trial Registries (September 2023), including randomised controlled trials (RCT), non-randomised control group comparative studies and cross-over trials reporting self- or clinician-reported anxiety symptoms. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool, with meta-analyses conducted by comparator group using random-effects models.

Results

Searches produced 3068 records, with 10 studies included, of which five were included in meta-analyses (n = 179). There was no evidence for a beneficial effect of beta-blockers compared with either placebo or benzodiazepines in patients with social phobia or panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (p-value for all meta-analyses ≥ 0.54).

Limitations

Many of the included studies had small sample sizes, missing data and high or unclear risk of bias.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers are increasingly prescribed for anxiety, yet there is a lack of robust evidence of effectiveness. There is a need to understand when and why practitioners are using these drugs, and to undertake a large RCT to provide definitive evidence of whether beta-blockers are an effective and safe treatment for anxiety.

### Blood glutamate scavenging as a novel glutamate-based therapeutic approach for post-traumatic brain injury anxiety and social impairment [^46cac0be]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious condition that requires significant economic resources for treatment, both for the individual patient and for the healthcare system. Patients with TBI need to be treated for the proximal effects of the trauma and for long-term effects, which can include life-long disability, as experienced by more than five million people in the United States.

TBI is also associated with an increase in severe, long-term psychiatric disorders. Among those with moderate to severe TBI, nearly half (49%) have shown indications of psychiatric illness within the first year after TBI, compared with 34% of those with mild TBI and 18% in the general population without TBI. These psychiatric illnesses commonly include major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social withdrawal, apathy, or aggression. TBI survivors can suffer these disorders for decades following the brain injury, causing major difficulties to lifestyle and health through disruptions to rehabilitation efforts.

Anxiety disorders, which occur in ~18% of the adult population, are often co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders and are associated with an elevated risk of suicide, and increased economic and social burden. Treatment involves pharmaceutical or behavioral therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which fails or leads to incomplete relief in 46.4% of patients. First-line pharmacological treatment for DSM-5 anxiety disorders primarily consists of antidepressants that modulate serotonin neurotransmission such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Serotonergic antidepressants, though, have a number of adverse effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, diaphoresis, headaches, tremor, asthenia, insomnia, and somnolence. Abruptly stopping antidepressant treatment can also result in a withdrawal syndrome characterized by increased anxiety symptoms, panic attacks, dizziness, and nausea.

### Escitalopram in the treatment of social anxiety disorder: analysis of efficacy for different clinical subgroups and symptom dimensions [^594af967]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

Escitalopram has demonstrated efficacy for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) in two placebo-controlled trials and for long-term treatment in a relapse-prevention study. Social anxiety disorder is a heterogeneous disorder. This study questions whether this new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is effective across different subgroups of patients. Data from two randomised, placebo-controlled, 12-week escitalopram SAD trials were pooled. General linear models were used to determine the efficacy of escitalopram in different patient subgroups. Furthermore, a factor analysis of the primary efficacy scale, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), was undertaken, and a determination made of whether treatment effects were similar for the different symptom dimensions. Escitalopram was effective in both younger and older patients, in male and female patients, and in patients with more and less severe social anxiety symptoms. The LSAS factor analysis showed six factors, which were differentially associated with different areas of disability. Escitalopram was significantly superior to placebo for all six symptom dimensions. The treatment effects of escitalopram were independent of gender, symptom severity and chronicity, and comorbid depressive symptoms. A six-factor model of social anxiety symptoms is supported by the distinctive association between these symptom dimensions and different areas of disability, but did not predict differential response to escitalopram.

### Neural predictors of cognitive-behavior therapy outcome in anxiety-related disorders: a meta-analysis of task-based fMRI studies [^576d26f3]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a well-established first-line intervention for anxiety-related disorders, including specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Several neural predictors of CBT outcome for anxiety-related disorders have been proposed, but previous results are inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating whole-brain predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders (17 studies, n = 442).

Results

Across different tasks, we observed that brain response in a network of regions involved in salience and interoception processing, encompassing fronto-insular (the right inferior frontal gyrus-anterior insular cortex) and fronto-limbic (the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) cortices was strongly associated with a positive CBT outcome.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that there are robust neural predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders that may eventually lead (probably in combination with other data) to develop personalized approaches for the treatment of these mental disorders.

### Psychodynamic therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy in social anxiety disorder: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^b801d485]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Various approaches to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have been shown to be effective for social anxiety disorder. For psychodynamic therapy, evidence for efficacy in this disorder is scant. The authors tested the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy and CBT in social anxiety disorder in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHOD In an outpatient setting, 495 patients with social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to manual-guided CBT (N = 209), manual-guided psychodynamic therapy (N = 207), or a waiting list condition (N = 79). Assessments were made at baseline and at end of treatment. Primary outcome measures were rates of remission and response, based on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale applied by raters blind to group assignment. Several secondary measures were assessed as well. RESULTS Remission rates in the CBT, psychodynamic therapy, and waiting list groups were 36%, 26%, and 9%, respectively. Response rates were 60%, 52%, and 15%, respectively. CBT and psychodynamic therapy were significantly superior to waiting list for both remission and response. CBT was significantly superior to psychodynamic therapy for remission but not for response. Between-group effect sizes for remission and response were small. Secondary outcome measures showed significant differences in favor of CBT for measures of social phobia and interpersonal problems, but not for depression. CONCLUSIONS CBT and psychodynamic therapy were both efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder, but there were significant differences in favor of CBT. For CBT, the response rate was comparable to rates reported in Swedish and German studies in recent years. For psychodynamic therapy, the response rate was comparable to rates reported for pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral group therapy.

### Social anxiety and agoraphobia symptoms effectively treated by prompt mental health care versus TAU at 6-and 12-month follow-up: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^b2b33bfa]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Interventions

A summary of interventions follows, we refer to the primary evaluation for further details (Knapstad et al. 2020; Lervik et al. 2020).

2.3.1 Prompt Mental Health Care

A matched‐care model organized care, where both initial assessment and client preferences informed choice of treatment, notably with low‐intensity treatments as recommended first choice. At both trial sites, most clients started with a four‐session psychoeducational course. Guided self‐help programs were to a little extent readily available during most of the trial period. Individual CBT was framed to 2–15 sessions. Treatment type and length did not differ significantly between those scoring above and below the clinical threshold for SAD/agoraphobia (all p > .05). The whole PMHC group received median 5 (IQR = 4–9) treatment sessions. In total, 85.8% received at least two treatment sessions (ex. assessment) and 76.9% completed treatment (therapist reporting that treatment goal was fulfilled and/or completed at least six sessions). Group‐based psychoeducation was the primary treatment form for 35.1%, individual CBT for 30.0%, and guided self‐help for 0.9%. The remaining 34.0% received a combination of these treatment forms.

2.3.2 Treatment as usual

This included all ordinary services available to the target population. This often included follow‐up by the GP, alternatively by private psychologists or occupational health services. The letter informing TAU clients about their allocation, also encouraged clients to contact their GP for further follow‐up, and provided references to publicly available self‐help resources (Internet, books).

As previously reported (Sæther et al. 2020), about one in four reported at a 12‐month follow‐up to have received some form of additional treatment in the PMHC group since baseline, while this was one in two in the TAU group. The additional treatment was mainly provided by GP's and/or specialist mental healthcare (Sæther et al. 2020). These patterns were similar for the subgroups of clients with clinically significant baseline levels of social anxiety and agoraphobia. As such, the TAU condition reflected, as intended, the situation before the arrival of PMHC.

Figure 4
Efficacy of classes of interventions

Classes of interventions are ordered according to efficacy ranking from largest mean effect (top, left) to smallest mean effect (bottom, right). Data in blue represent the effects on symptoms of social anxiety (SMD [95% CrI]); SMD less than 0 favours the intervention in the row. Data in green represent the effects on recovery (RR [95% CrI]); RR greater than 1 favours the intervention in the column. Significant results are shaded dark blue and dark green. CBT = cognitive–behavioural therapy. CrI = credible interval. EXER = promotion of exercise. EXPO = exposure and social skills. MAOI = monoamine oxidase inhibitors. NSSA = noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants. OTHER = other psychological therapy. PDPT = psychodynamic psychotherapy. PSYP = psychological placebo. RR = risk ratio. SHNS = self-help without support. SHWS = self-help with support. SMD = standardised mean difference. SNRI = serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. SSRI = selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor.

Of the pharmacological interventions, there were greater individual effects compared with waitlist for all SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) and the SNRI venlafaxine. Effects of SSRIs and SNRIs were measured in 32 studies, and they were similar in magnitude within the class except for citalopram, which was assessed in two small studies; all individual SMDs were within 0.08 of the class SMD. Compared with waitlist, the effects of the MOAIs phenelzine (SMD −1.28, −1.57 to −0.98) and moclobemide (−0.74, −1.03 to −0.44) were also greater; however, only 125 people received phenelzine across five trials and the results might be overestimated. The large effect for phenelzine was dissimilar to the small effect for moclobemide (appendix B), which was the only other MAOI included in the analysis.

### Dopaminergic challenges in social anxiety disorder: evidence for dopamine D3 desensitisation following successful treatment with serotonergic antidepressants [^703b288e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder [SAnD], though there is evidence of dopaminergic system dysfunction. Twenty subjects with DSM-IV SAnD, untreated (n = 10) and SSRI-remitted DSM-IV SAnD (n = 10), were administered a single dose of 1) a dopamine agonist (pramipexole 0.5 mg) and 2) a dopamine antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg), followed by anxiogenic challenges (verbal tasks and autobiographical scripts) in a double-blind crossover design, the two test days being one week apart. Anxiety symptoms were measured by self-reported changes in Visual Analogue Scales, specific SAnD scales and anxiety questionnaires. Plasma levels of prolactin were obtained. Untreated SAnD subjects experienced significant increases in anxiety symptoms following behavioural challenges after either sulpiride or pramipexole. Following remission with SSRIs, the socially anxiogenic effect of behavioural provocation was significantly attenuated under pramipexole, whereas under sulpiride effects remained significantly elevated. There appears to be instability of the dopamine system under behavioural stress in social anxiety subjects that is only partly rectified by successful treatment with an SSRI, which may induce a desensitisation of postsynaptic dopamine D(3) receptors.

### Psychotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^b5a440b9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders in adults. Psychotherapies are among the most recommended treatments for GAD, but which should be considered as first-line treatment needs to be clarified.

Objective

To use a network meta-analysis to examine the short- and long-term associations of different psychotherapies with outcomes of effectiveness and acceptability in adults with GAD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from database inception to January 1, 2023, to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of psychotherapies for adults with GAD.

Study Selection

RCTs comparing any type of psychotherapy against another or with a control condition for the treatment of adults (≥ 18 years, both sexes) with a primary diagnosis of GAD were eligible for inclusion.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study followed Cochrane standards for extracting data and assessing data quality and used the PRISMA guideline for reporting. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the second version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis was used to rate the certainty of evidence for meta-analytical results.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Eight psychotherapies were compared against one another and with 2 control conditions. Primary outcomes were severity of GAD symptoms and acceptability of the psychotherapies. Random-effects model pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted. For effectiveness, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were pooled, and for acceptability, relative risks with 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Data from 65 RCTs were included. Effect size estimates on data from 5048 participants (mean [SD], 70.9% [11.9%] women; mean [SD] age, 42.2 [12.5] years) suggested that third-wave cognitive behavior therapies (CBTs) (SMD, -0.76 [95% CI, -1.15 to -0.36]; certainty, moderate), CBT (SMD, -0.74 [95% CI, -1.09 to -0.38]; certainty, moderate), and relaxation therapy (SMD, -0.59 [95% CI, -1.07 to -0.11]; certainty, low) were associated with reduced GAD symptoms vs treatment as usual. Relative risks for all-cause discontinuation (indication of acceptability) signaled no differences compared with treatment as usual for all psychotherapies (eg, relative risk, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.64–1.67] for CBT vs treatment as usual). When excluding studies at high risk of bias, relaxation therapy lost its superiority over treatment as usual (SMD, -0.47; 95% CI, -1.18 to 0.23). When considering anxiety severity at 3 to 12 months after completion of the intervention, only CBT remained significantly associated with greater effectiveness than treatment as usual (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.21).

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the evidence in this systematic review and network meta-analysis for its associations with both acute and long-term effectiveness, CBT may represent the first-line therapy of GAD. Third-wave CBTs and relaxation therapy were associated with short-term effectiveness and may also be offered.
