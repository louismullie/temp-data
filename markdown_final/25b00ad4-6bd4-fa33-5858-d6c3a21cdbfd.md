## Question

A 58-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a 2-year history of chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. She reports that the pain has gradually worsened, limiting her ability to walk long distances and participate in gardening, which she enjoys. She has tried over-the-counter acetaminophen intermittently, with partial relief. She has not participated in any structured physical therapy or exercise program. She asks if you can prescribe her opioid pain medication, as her neighbor has found it helpful for similar pain.

Based on current CDC guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial approach to managing this patient's chronic arthritic pain, and how should opioid therapy be considered in her case?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 58-year-old woman with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain who is requesting opioid therapy, and specifically wants to know the most appropriate initial approach and how to consider opioids if needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline pain and function. Then, I should verify the first-line, nonpharmacologic recommendations and their evidence base. Next, I will review nonopioid pharmacologic options and their comparative effectiveness. After that, I need to check the guideline stance on opioids for osteoarthritis and the quality of evidence. Then, I should outline a risk–benefit framework and monitoring plan if opioids are ever considered. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and communicate it clearly to the patient, ensuring shared decision-making and safety.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline assessment. Chronic knee osteoarthritis is a clinical diagnosis in patients over 45 with activity-related pain and brief morning stiffness, and imaging is not routinely required unless red flags are present, so I should anchor on history and exam and then quantify pain and function with a simple tool like the PEG (Pain, Enjoyment, General activity) to track progress over time [^116LR7K8] [^11313a3v].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line foundation: nonpharmacologic therapy is preferred and should be maximized before any escalation. Exercise therapy — particularly strengthening, low-impact aerobic activity, and neuromuscular training — improves pain and function in knee osteoarthritis, and weight loss for those with overweight/obesity is strongly recommended; I should also consider assistive devices and patient education to support self-management and activity pacing [^116LR7K8] [^1131tMBP] [^117SsDZM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications yet. I need to check nonopioid pharmacologic options and their evidence. Topical NSAIDs are a good next step for localized knee pain, with favorable safety compared with oral NSAIDs, especially in older adults; if topical therapy is insufficient, I can consider oral NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, or duloxetine as an alternative or adjunct, noting that acetaminophen has limited effectiveness for osteoarthritis and is not first-line in current guidance [^117JtNRK] [^1131tMBP] [^1167HXN7].

> I should confirm the stance on opioids before discussing them with the patient. The CDC 2022 guideline states nonopioid therapies are preferred for chronic pain and that opioids should be considered only if benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks after maximizing nonpharmacologic and nonopioid options; importantly, evidence for long-term opioid benefit in osteoarthritis is limited, with small average benefits that diminish over time and meaningful risks of dependence, overdose, and adverse effects, so routine opioid initiation is not recommended [^115AbWS9] [^114KTDUG] [^113sLZsH].

> Let me consider disease-specific guidance to ensure alignment. The VA/DoD osteoarthritis guideline issues a weak recommendation against initiating opioids, including tramadol, for hip and knee osteoarthritis due to very low-quality evidence and unfavorable risk–benefit balance; the ACR guideline allows tramadol as a conditional option, but this reflects limited evidence and should be interpreted cautiously in the context of broader recommendations to avoid routine opioid use in osteoarthritis [^116fWkSw] [^111u6Kn5].

> If, after a structured trial of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies, pain remains severe and function remains limited, I need to ensure a careful risk–benefit discussion and documentation of goals. Before any opioid trial, I should review PDMP data, screen for mental health and substance use risks, avoid sedative co-prescribing, and co-prescribe naloxone when indicated; if initiated, I would use the lowest effective dose of an immediate-release opioid for a short, time-limited trial with predefined functional goals and a plan to discontinue if benefits do not outweigh risks [^115AbWS9] [^111F2YBX] [^114H38Wk] [^115PSmeW].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence. For subacute or chronic pain, reassess benefits and harms within 1–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation, then at least every 3 months if continued, with closer follow-up for higher-risk regimens or comorbidities; clinically meaningful improvement is often defined as about a 30% reduction in pain and improvement in function, which should guide continuation or tapering decisions [^114Z8NZ8] [^112U4wgZ] [^11313a3v].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about access to nonpharmacologic care? I need to ensure equitable, feasible options. Walking programs, community exercise classes, and telehealth-based stepped exercise programs can be effective and lower-cost ways to deliver structured activity; I should also address barriers such as transportation, insurance coverage, and safety concerns to make the plan realistic and sustainable [^117SsDZM] [^1131tMBP].

> Let me synthesize the prioritized plan. First, confirm the diagnosis and establish baseline pain and function with PEG. Second, initiate a structured exercise program and weight-loss counseling if applicable, with referral to physical therapy if needed. Third, optimize nonopioid pharmacotherapy, starting with topical NSAIDs and escalating to oral NSAIDs or duloxetine if needed, while reassessing response. Fourth, reserve opioids as a last resort after these steps, using a short, closely monitored trial only if benefits are expected to outweigh risks, with explicit exit criteria and safety measures. Fifth, schedule regular follow-up to track function, adverse effects, and misuse risk, and adjust the plan accordingly [^116LR7K8] [^115AbWS9] [^1131tMBP].

> I will now examine how to communicate this to the patient. I should explain that current evidence shows exercise, weight management, and topical or oral NSAIDs or duloxetine provide meaningful improvements for most patients with knee osteoarthritis, whereas opioids offer small, short-term benefits at best and carry substantial risks; I will also clarify that guidelines from CDC and VA/DoD recommend against routine opioid use for osteoarthritis, and that our plan prioritizes safer, more effective options first, with opioids reserved for exceptional circumstances after shared decision-making [^115AbWS9] [^11329yVx] [^116LR7K8].

---

The most appropriate initial approach is a **multimodal, non-opioid plan** [^115AbWS9] emphasizing exercise-based physical therapy, weight loss if overweight, and topical NSAIDs as first-line pharmacotherapy [^117JtNRK] [^1167HXN7]. Opioids are not first-line for chronic osteoarthritis pain [^11329yVx] and should be considered only if non-opioid therapies fail and benefits clearly outweigh risks [^115AbWS9]; if used, start low, go slow, and monitor closely with PDMP checks and naloxone co-prescribing [^111F2YBX] [^115PSmeW]. This aligns with CDC 2022 and VA/DoD guidance to maximize non-opioid care and reserve opioids for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making [^115AbWS9] [^11329yVx].

---

## Recommended initial management approach

### Nonpharmacologic therapies (first-line)

- **Exercise-based physical therapy**: Structured programs (aerobic, resistance, aquatic) improve pain, function, and quality of life in knee OA [^116LR7K8] [^1131tMBP].
- **Weight loss**: For patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², weight loss reduces pain and improves function [^116LR7K8].
- **Patient education and self-management**: Education on joint protection, activity modification, and self-management improves outcomes [^116LR7K8] [^115hPey4].

---

### Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (first-line)

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Preferred for localized knee OA pain; lower systemic risk than oral NSAIDs [^117JtNRK] [^1131tMBP].
- **Oral NSAIDs**: Use at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration; monitor for GI, CV, and renal risks, especially in older adults [^117JtNRK] [^116wYT4B].
- **Duloxetine**: Consider for patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs or contraindications [^117JtNRK] [^111iGkv9].
- **Acetaminophen**: May be considered, but evidence for efficacy in OA is limited; use cautiously with hepatic disease [^117JtNRK] [^1153yu57].

---

## Role of opioid therapy

### General principles

Opioids are **not first-line** for chronic pain, including OA [^115AbWS9]; consider only if benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks after maximizing non-opioid therapies [^11224N28]. Before initiating, discuss realistic benefits and risks, establish measurable goals, and plan for discontinuation if benefits do not outweigh risks [^11313a3v].

---

### Specific considerations for osteoarthritis

Evidence for opioids in OA is **limited**, with small average benefits and significant risks (misuse, overdose, fractures, falls) [^117REtmr] [^114KTDUG]. The VA/DoD recommends against initiating opioids for hip/knee OA; if considered, use the lowest effective dose, avoid ER/LA formulations, and monitor closely [^11329yVx] [^114H38Wk].

---

## Risk mitigation strategies if opioids are prescribed

If opioids are prescribed, implement the following:

| **Risk mitigation strategy** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| PDMP review | Check state PDMP before prescribing and periodically during therapy [^1129F96H] [^1121agYX] |
| Naloxone co-prescribing | Offer naloxone to patients at overdose risk (≥ 50 MME/day, concurrent CNS depressants, history of OUD) [^114wjGTx] |
| Benzodiazepine avoidance | Avoid concurrent benzodiazepines when possible [^114QmWu7] |
| Regular monitoring | Reassess benefits and harms within 1–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation, then every 3 months [^114Z8NZ8] [^112U4wgZ] |
| Functional goals | Set and track functional goals (e.g. walking distance, gardening) to guide therapy [^11313a3v] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older adults have higher risks with NSAIDs and opioids; tailor choices and monitor closely [^116wYT4B].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential; consider patient values and goals [^112SEUz1].
- **Access and affordability**: Address barriers to nonpharmacologic care and consider low-cost options (e.g. community programs, telehealth) [^117SsDZM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Strength of recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonpharmacologic therapies (exercise, weight loss, education) | Strong | High |
| Topical NSAIDs | Strong | High |
| Oral NSAIDs (lowest effective dose, shortest duration) | Strong | High |
| Duloxetine | Conditional | Moderate |
| Acetaminophen | Conditional | Low |
| Opioids (only if benefits outweigh risks) | Weak | Low |

---

The most appropriate initial approach is a **multimodal, non-opioid plan** emphasizing exercise, weight loss, and topical NSAIDs, with escalation to oral NSAIDs or duloxetine as needed. Opioids are not first-line and should be reserved for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making and close monitoring [^115AbWS9] [^11329yVx].

Regarding medical management for chronic arthritic pain, more specifically with respect to analgesic therapy, CDC 2016 guidelines recommend to implement nonpharmacologic therapy and non-opioid analgesics as first-line treatment for chronic non-cancer pain. Consider opioid therapy only if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, consider combining with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate.

Recommendation 2

Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

Each of the 12 recommendation statements is followed by considerations for implementation and a rationale for the recommendation. The implementation considerations offer practical insights, context, and specific examples meant to further inform clinician-patient decision-making for the respective recommendation and are not meant to be rigidly or inflexibly followed.

The recommendations are grouped into four areas:

Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain
Selecting opioids and determining dosages
Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up
Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use

In addition, these five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across recommendations (Box 4):

BOX 4
Guiding principles for implementation of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain — United States, 2022 recommendations

Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.
Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.

ASIPP guidelines — Continuation and maintenance phase: After initiation of opioid therapy and stable maintenance for 8 to 12 weeks with appropriate outcomes, it is important to arrive at a conclusion to either continue or to discontinue the opioids. If persistent or new pain is present, a comprehensive evaluation can be repeated or a specialist referral made; if there is any indication of abuse, misuse, lack of analgesia or activity, adverse effects, or aberrant behavior, the physician may consider tapering or discontinuing therapy after careful assessment. Per prior CDC recommendations, physicians should evaluate for a 30% benefit in pain and function with opioid treatment and ensure there is no misuse/abuse or major adverse effects. If treatment is successful, intermittent dose reduction may be considered to test a lower dose, and if continuing therapy is necessary, close patient monitoring is imperative.

Opioids

The United States accounts for 5% of the worldwide population yet consumes roughly 80% of opioids worldwide. As a nation, we have a obvious proclivity for choosing opioids to treat pain, even in cases where other treatments have been shown to be more effective and safer long term – as is the case when it comes to treating knee pain. From 2004 to 2014, 16% of the patients presenting with knee pain and osteoarthritis were prescribed opioid medications for treatment. Despite this, there are no data supporting the effectiveness of chronic opioids for either pain or functional improvement in patients with osteoarthritis. In fact, only about 35% of the patients who take opioids for osteoarthritis report pain improvement. This is compared to 31% of the patients who were given placebo for similar pain. Similar numbers are revealed when we evaluate physical functional improvements in response to opioids or placebo. While opioids have not demonstrated benefits, they definitely have their risks. Opioid-naïve patients who are prescribed an 8-day supply of opioids have a 13.5% probability of continuing opioid therapy at 1-year. If this is increased to > 30 days, the probability increases to 29.9%. With the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reporting 46,802 opioid overdose deaths in 2018, the risk of opioid therapy in this population is felt to be greater than any potential benefit, with the exception of high-risk patients with limited alternative therapies.

Despite the presence of a plethora of suitable alternatives (most of which possess high levels of evidence to support their utility), practitioners continue to recommend opioids for the treatment of knee pain – even though there is little-to-no evidence to support their use in this particular setting. One of the principal goals of these guidelines is to illustrate just how many evidence-based treatment options that are available for knee pain that go beyond a seemingly innocuous prescription for opioid pain medication.

Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain

All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e. pain lasting < 1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e. pain lasting 1–3 months] or chronic pain [i.e. pain lasting > 3 months].)

Recommendation 1

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

Opioid therapy medical necessity requires a complete medical evaluation with documentation of diagnosis and previous treatments across non-pharmacologic, pharmacologic, psychological, procedural, and surgical interventions; opioid therapy is only one part of a multidisciplinary and multimodality treatment program and response demonstrating reduction in pain with improvements in function and QOL should support and be documented for continued treatment; the CDC recommends that clinicians should consider non-opioid therapies are preferred, and clinicians should discuss known risks and benefits, establish clear treatment goals, and consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks; Recommendation 5 states that prior to starting opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss the realistic benefits and known risks, establish clear treatment goals for pain and/or function, and should consider – and discuss – how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks, with Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong.

Despite their favorable benefit-to-risk profile, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always covered or fully covered by insurance. Access and cost can be barriers for patients, particularly persons who have low incomes, do not have health insurance or have inadequate insurance, have transportation challenges, or live in rural areas where services might not be available. Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness. In addition, for many patients, aspects of these approaches can be used even when access to specialty care is limited. For example, previous guidelines have strongly recommended aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip and maintenance of physical activity, including normal daily activities, for patients with low back pain. A randomized trial found no difference in reduced chronic low back pain intensity, frequency, or disability between patients assigned to relatively low-cost group aerobics and those assigned to individual physiotherapy or muscle reconditioning sessions. Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise. A randomized trial found a stepped exercise program, in which patients were initially offered an Internet-based exercise program and progressively advanced to biweekly coaching calls and then to in-person physical therapy if not improved at previous steps, successfully improved symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, with 35% of patients ultimately requiring in-person physical therapy. In addition, primary care clinicians can integrate elements of psychosocial therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which addresses psychosocial contributors to pain and improves function, by encouraging patients to take an active role in the care plan, supporting patients in engaging in activities such as exercise that are typically beneficial but that might initially be associated with fear of exacerbating pain, or providing education in relaxation techniques and coping strategies. In many locations, free or low-cost patient support, self-help, and educational community-based or employer-sponsored programs are available that can provide stress reduction and other mental health benefits. Clinicians should become familiar with such options within their communities so they can refer patients to low-cost services. Patients with higher levels of anxiety or fear related to pain or other clinically significant psychological distress can be referred for treatment with a mental health specialist (e.g. psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker).

### Treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a clinical practice… [^112S3KdF]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice from AFP Persons with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis should participate in self-management programs, strengthening, low-impact aerobic exercise, and neuromuscular education. Acupuncture, glucosamine, and chondroitin are not recommended therapies for knee osteoarthritis. Recommended pharmacologic therapies include oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tramadol. Hyaluronic acid injections are not recommended, and evidence to support corticosteroid injections is inconclusive From the AFP Editors. In the United States, approximately 240 per 100, 000 persons per year have knee osteoarthritis. In 2010, approximately 9. 9 millions adults had symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The risk of this condition, especially in women, increases with age. Other risk factors include genetics, being overweight, working in certain job fields, repeated bending of the knee or heavy lifting, and hereditary vulnerability.

Older adults who self-report having osteoarthritis have more appointments with their physicians and have more limited function than those without osteoarthritis. The aging population, increase in obesity rates, and increased focus on older persons staying active indicate that knee osteoarthritis will continue to have a large impact on the emotional and physical health of the U. S. population. This clinical guideline from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons updates the one previously published in 2008 and addresses treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in adults 19 years and older. Strength of recommendation in this guideline was defined as follows: Strong: benefits of the approach clearly exceed the potential harm, and/or the quality of the supporting evidence is high.

Moderate: benefits exceed the potential harm, but the quality or applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Limited: quality of the supporting evidence is unconvincing, or well-conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach over another. Consensus: expert opinion supports the recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Inconclusive: lack of compelling evidence, resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Treatment Recommendations CONSERVATIVE Persons with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis should participate in self-management programs, strengthening, low-impact aerobic exercise, and neuromuscular education. They should also participate in physical activity as outlined by national guidelines.

It is suggested that those with a body mass index of 25 kg per m. 2 or greater should lose weight. Acupuncture, glucosamine, and chondroitin are not recommended. Most of the studies regarding the use of acupuncture were not statistically significant, much of the evidence was not clinically significant, and some outcomes were associated with clinical, but not statistical, significance. A considerable amount of research has been done on glucosamine and chondroitin; however, there is basically no evidence indicating that there are clinically important outcomes compared with placebo. The strength of recommendation against acupuncture, glucosamine, and chondroitin use was based on lack of effectiveness, not on possible harm. The use of lateral wedge insoles is not suggested. A recommendation for or against the use of physical agents (e.g.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113t7Bkw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain - United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1–49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of < 1 month), subacute (duration of 1–3 months), and chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1131tMBP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis.
Clinicians should recommend appropriate noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to help manage chronic pain, such as exercise (e.g. aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g. yoga, tai chi, or qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache.
Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.
Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness.
Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.
When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g. knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered.
NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding.
When patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications.
Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
In patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g. amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g. duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g. topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e. pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8).
Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.
Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful.
Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals.
For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥ 30 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5).
Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions.
Clinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance.
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

Introduction

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care in the United States. Acute pain, a nearly universal experience, is a physiologic response to noxious stimuli that can become pathologic. Acute pain is usually sudden in onset and time limited (defined in this clinical practice guideline as having a duration of < 1 month) and often is caused by injury, trauma, or medical treatments such as surgery. Unresolved acute pain or subacute pain (defined in this clinical practice guideline as pain that has been present for 1–3 months) can evolve into chronic pain. Chronic pain typically lasts > 3 months and can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or unknown cause. Approximately one in five U.S. adults had chronic pain in 2019 and approximately one in 14 adults experienced "high-impact" chronic pain, defined as having pain on most days or every day during the past 3 months that limited life or work activities. Pain, especially chronic pain, can affect almost every aspect of a person's life, leading to impaired physical functioning, poor mental health, and reduced quality of life, and contributes to substantial morbidity each year. In 2011, the economic costs of chronic pain were estimated to range from $560 to $635 billion in annual direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to clinical monitoring, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program data when prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations putting the patient at high risk for overdose.

Review of the patient's history and context beyond the presenting pain syndrome is helpful in selection of pain treatments. In particular, medications should be used only after assessment and determination that expected benefits outweigh risks, considering patient-specific factors. For example, clinicians should consider fall risk when selecting and dosing potentially sedating medications (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids) and should weigh benefits and risks of use, dosage, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults and patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. NSAIDs are potentially inappropriate for use in older adults with chronic pain because of higher risk for adverse effects with prolonged use. Some guidelines recommend topical NSAIDs for localized osteoarthritis (e.g. knee osteoarthritis) over oral NSAIDs in patients aged ≥ 75 years to minimize systemic effects. (See Recommendation 8 for additional considerations for assessing risks of opioid therapy.)

Implementation Considerations

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

HIVMA/IDSA chronic pain guideline — opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain in persons living with HIV: Patients who do not respond to first-line therapies and who report moderate to severe pain and functional impairment can be considered for a time-limited trial of opioid analgesics (weak, low), with values and preferences placing a relatively high value on safer opioid prescribing and balancing potential benefits against risks of adverse events, misuse, diversion, and addiction; as a second- or third-line treatment for chronic nonneuropathic pain, a typical adult regimen should start with the smallest effective dose, combining short- and long-acting opioids. Tramadol taken for up to 3 months may decrease pain and improve stiffness, function, and overall well-being in patients with osteoarthritis (weak, moderate), with studied dosing ranging from 37.5 mg (combined with 325 mg of acetaminophen) once daily to 400 mg in divided doses.

### Issues in opioid management [^115Fouok]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Although a universal consensus has evolved concerning the utility of opioids in cancer pain, the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain syndromes is much debated in the medical literature. Although for clinical, regulatory, and medicolegal reasons, many clinicians disagree with their use, others find them helpful, with little prevalence of abuse behaviors or intolerable adverse effects. In a review of this topic, several issues of relevance to management decisions, including efficacy, medication compliance, and safety, are evaluated. As a clinically distinct population among chronic pain sufferers, patients with arthritis-associated pain (including rheumatoid and osteoarthritis) are discussed separately. Particularly important issues with regard to prescribing decisions, including divergent goals and expectations, and factors associated with avoidance of withdrawal and addiction, are also evaluated to ensure that management of patients with nonmalignant chronic pain is optimized when opioids are considered.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114Jgcp4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs. For postoperative pain, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of use and refills and on consensus).

Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected. However, if pain continues longer than expected, some patients might face challenges in successfully navigating the health care system (e.g. clinician and pharmacy contact, transportation, and need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems should ensure all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment as needed to minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills.

Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain. If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy. If patients already receiving long-term opioids require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.

Supporting Rationale

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Detailed recommendations on diagnosis are provided in other guidelines. Evaluation should include a focused history, including history and characteristics of pain and potential contributing factors (e.g. function, work history and current work demands, psychosocial stressors, and sleep), and physical examination, with imaging or other diagnostic testing only if indicated (e.g. if severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or if serious underlying conditions are suspected). For complex pain syndromes, consultation with a pain specialist can be considered to assist with diagnosis and management.

Diagnosis can help identify disease-specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g. improving glucose control to prevent progression of diabetic neuropathy; immune-modulating agents for rheumatoid arthritis; physical or occupational therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve severe mechanical or compressive pain). The underlying mechanism for most pain syndromes has traditionally been categorized as neuropathic (e.g. diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia) or nociceptive (e.g. osteoarthritis and muscular back pain). More recently, nociplastic pain has been suggested as a third, distinct category of pain with augmented central nervous system pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation as experienced in conditions such as fibromyalgia. The diagnosis and pathophysiologic mechanism of pain have implications for symptomatic pain treatment with medication. For example, evidence is limited for improved pain or function, or evidence exists of worse outcomes, with long-term use of opioids for several chronic pain conditions for which opioids are commonly prescribed, such as osteoarthritis, nonspecific low back pain, headache, and fibromyalgia. For moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain, a nonopioid strategy starting with acetaminophen or NSAIDs results in improved pain intensity with fewer side effects compared with a strategy starting with opioids. Tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI antidepressants, selected anticonvulsants, or transdermal lidocaine are recommended for neuropathic pain syndromes (e.g. diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia).

When to consider opioid analgesia

As a general rule, opioids are not usually the first-line agents to manage pain unless the pain is acute (e.g. traumatic pain or postsurgical pain) or overwhelmingly severe. Guidelines for various pain syndromes usually specify that nonopioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be utilized first and opioids trialed only if nonopioid therapy does not offer adequate analgesia.–Thus, patients with pain associated with osteoarthritis may first be administered acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and progress to opioids only if these agents do not provide adequate pain control.

Opioid therapy in an opioid-naïve patient should commence as a trial rather than the initiation of long-term therapy. The patient and caregivers should be informed about the potential risks as well as benefits of opioid therapy. In some cases, informed consent or another type of agreement should be signed to assure that the patient understands not just the risks of opioid therapy but the clinician's expectation for patient compliance as well. Patients should be educated about possible side effects, so that they are reported promptly. Clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if the expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh the risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function, and should consider how therapy will be discontinued if the benefits do not outweigh the risks. Clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Clinicians should review prescription drug monitoring program data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain.

For clinicians, predicting whether benefits of opioids for chronic pain will outweigh risks of ongoing opioid treatment for individual patients can be challenging. Therefore, opioid therapy should only be initiated with consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy that could be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful in improving pain and pain-related function.

Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. Some patients have reported treatment goals are effective in increasing motivation and functioning. Goals ideally include improvement in function (including social, emotional, and physical dimensions), pain, and quality of life. Goals can be tailored to specific patient and clinical circumstances. For example, for some patients with diseases typically associated with progressive functional impairment or catastrophic injuries such as spinal cord trauma, reductions in pain without improvement in physical function might be more realistic. Clinicians can assess and then follow function, pain severity, and quality of life using tools such as the three-item PEG (Pain average, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity) assessment scale (see Recommendation 7). Clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a 30% improvement in scores for both pain and function. Clinicians can ask patients about functional goals that have meaning for them (e.g. walking the dog or walking around the block, returning to part-time work, and attending family events or recreational activities), and then use these goals in assessing benefits of opioid therapy and weighing benefits against risks of continued opioid therapy for individual patients (see Recommendation 7).

Patients with subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point, both for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should reevaluate patients with subacute pain and their treatment course, ensure that potentially reversible causes of ongoing pain are addressed, and optimize pain management as needed. For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥ 30 days, clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid prescribing simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid guideline — objectives and application outlines that these evidence-based guidelines address initial steps of opioid therapy, assessment of effectiveness, monitoring adherence and side effects, and final-phase decisions about continuation or discontinuation based on individual response, risk, and harms. They are intended for interventional pain physicians, do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations, and expect clinicians to develop case-by-case plans based on patient-specific factors and clinician expertise. The document states these guidelines do not represent a "standard of care", acknowledges that some interventions may have strong clinical support even without formally graded evidence, aims to inform practitioners, patients, payors, and regulators about whether evidence supports a "standard" for chronic opioid therapy, and emphasizes the distinction between "standard" and "standard of care".

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^1171iGPs]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this Internet-based survey of people with chronic pain that was conducted after the publication of the CDC guideline for opioid prescribing, decreases in opioid dose were associated with reduced pain control and diminished function. These results demonstrate a need for further guidance on how to apply the CDC guideline to patients with chronic pain who are stable on long-term opioid therapy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic arthritic pain, more specifically with respect to pain assessment, EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to assess for the following as part of the initial evaluation of patients with inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis:

- patient's needs, preferences, and priorities regarding pain management and important activities, values, and goals in daily life

- patient's pain characteristics, including severity, type, spread, and quality

- previous and ongoing pain treatments and the perceived efficacy

- current inflammation and joint damage as sources of pain, and whether these are adequately treated

- pain-related factors that might need attention, including the nature and extent of pain-related disability, beliefs and emotions about pain and pain-related disability, social influences related to pain and its consequences, sleep problems, and obesity.

### Opioid guidelines are a necessary response to the opioid crisis [^112xTARG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines for opioid prescribing in noncancer pain have proliferated since the opioid crisis in the United States became widely recognized. The recently published Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for opioid prescribing have been controversial. Many of these concerns arise from underestimation of the scale of the opioid crisis, as well as misunderstanding what the guidelines actually say. Strict guidelines should be welcomed as a constructive approach to managing a thorny public health issue.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113LMk8q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid naïve, risks also might be associated with dosage escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long-term opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implemented for both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible. If additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1154BiF8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study finding long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1–36 MME/day), medium (36–120 MME/day), and high (≥ 120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction.

Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies "may be preferred" or "may be effective" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies "are preferred" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.

Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111yVqEc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Future Directions

CDC indicated the intent to evaluate and reassess the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline as new evidence became available and determine when sufficient new evidence would prompt an update. CDC funded AHRQ to conduct systematic reviews of the scientific evidence. The following five areas were assessed: 1) noninvasive nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain, 2) nonopioid pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain, 3) opioid treatments for chronic pain, 4) treatments for acute pain, and 5) acute treatments for episodic migraine. An update to the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline was warranted on the basis of these reviews.

The new evidence reviews conducted by AHRQ's Evidence-based Practice Centers affirmed the appropriateness of the recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline for using opioids to treat chronic pain. The reviews also prompted CDC to modify the recommendations to include acute and subacute pain more explicitly. This updated clinical practice guideline also includes a new topline recommendation for patients who are already receiving ongoing opioid therapy for pain. Specifically, the clinical practice guideline outlines how clinicians and patients should work together in assessing the benefits and risks of continued opioid use and if or when to taper opioids to a lower dosage or discontinue opioids altogether in accordance with the HHS Tapering Guide.

Four key areas are covered in this clinical practice guideline for prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients aged ≥ 18 years for pain, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. These areas are 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain; 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages; 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up; and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. In addition, five guiding principles were identified to inform implementation across recommendations. These guiding principles focus on 1) the appropriate treatment of pain; 2) flexibility to meet the care needs and clinical circumstances of each patient; 3) a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management; 4) avoiding misapplication of the clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use; and 5) vigilance in attending to health inequities and ensuring access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain treatment for all persons.

### Patient information: knee osteoarthritis… [^116LR7K8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Voelker R. What Is Knee Osteoarthritis. JAMA. 2024; 332:

1954. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.17482 Knee osteoarthritis is a common cause of knee pain and disability among adults. Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that consists of damage to the cartilage, bone, and surrounding tissues of the knee. It affects approximately 23% of people older than 40 years worldwide and about 45% of people by age 85 years.

1. People who are most likely to develop knee osteoarthritis include women and individuals with obesity, a previous knee injury, misaligned knees, or weak thigh muscles and those who squat and kneel frequently for work, such as farm workers. The most common symptoms of knee osteoarthritis are knee pain with activity and/or functional limitations such as difficulty getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, and walking. Additional symptoms may include morning knee stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes, knee swelling, and a sensation of the knee buckling or giving way.

Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis typically begin gradually and may include brief, intermittent flares of knee pain. Knee osteoarthritis is typically diagnosed based on a patient's medical history and physical examination. Common signs include a cracking or popping sound with knee movement, knee joint enlargement, and a limited range of motion of the knee. X-rays are not needed to make the diagnosis in patients aged 45 years or older who have activity-related knee pain without morning stiffness or with morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes. X-rays and laboratory tests may be used for patients with atypical symptoms such as prolonged joint stiffness or knee pain at rest, a change in symptoms such as knee swelling and redness with nighttime pain or an unexpectedly rapid progression of symptoms, or if another knee condition is suspected. X-rays can help assess the severity of knee osteoarthritis, prognosis, and likelihood of improvement with knee replacement surgery.

Because there are currently no therapies that reverse or prevent progression of knee osteoarthritis, treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. First-line treatments are exercise therapy, weight loss for those with overweight or obesity, patient education, and use of a knee brace or cane, if indicated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are applied to the skin or taken orally may help reduce knee pain. However, oral NSAIDs should be used for a short duration at the lowest effective dose. For patients with persistent pain due to knee osteoarthritis, injection of corticosteroids into the knee joint may provide temporary pain relief. Commonly used medications such as acetaminophen, duloxetine, and tramadol are only conditionally recommended for knee osteoarthritis. Other treatments, including supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin, opioids, acupuncture, and arthroscopy, have not been proven effective for knee osteoarthritis.

Total knee replacement surgery may be considered for patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis on x-ray and persistent symptoms despite 6 months of behavioral and medical treatments. Although many patients have substantially decreased pain in the first 12 months after total knee replacement, 10% to 34% report long-term pain between 3 months and 5 years afterward.

### Opioid management: initiating, monitoring, and tapering [^113KXguR]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous guidelines targeting safe use of opioids for chronic pain have been published but substantial challenges persist in clinical application of best practice recommendations. This article describes a pragmatic approach to clinical care of adults with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy. Three components of care are emphasized: (1) medical and mental health assessment before initiating opioid therapy, (2) clinical surveillance during the course of long-term opioid therapy, and (3) clinical considerations and strategies governing opioid tapering. A pressing need exists for ongoing research to further clarify the optimal role that long-term opioid therapy has in treatment of chronic pain.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1177AgQN]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

CDC invited input on the draft clinical practice guideline and received approximately 5,500 public comments. Many of these comments were related to experiences with pain or with the aftermath of a family member's, friend's, or significant person's overdose; barriers to and access to pain care and evidence-based treatment; concerns about the level of specificity of recommendations; and overall communication and implementation of the clinical practice guideline. Some respondents expressed concerns that insufficient specificity of recommendations might leave clinicians without sufficient practical advice or context, whereas others were concerned that inclusion of more-specific recommendations or information in the guideline could facilitate misapplication through adaption of the clinical practice guideline or components of the guideline into rigid policies and laws. CDC incorporated insights from public comments into the clinical practice guideline, including special considerations for each recommendation. To help prevent misapplication of recommendations as inflexible rules and enable clinicians to account for individualized, person-centered clinical considerations, specific prescription dosages and durations are generally not included in the summary recommendation statements, which highlight general principles. Greater specificity is provided in implementation considerations and supporting rationales, which can offer more flexibility to help clinicians weigh benefits and risks of different therapeutic courses for specific patients.

Recommendation statements emphasize that opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before initiating opioid therapy for patients with pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy. Before starting ongoing opioid therapy for patients with subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function and consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are initiated, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage of immediate-release opioids for no longer than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. During ongoing opioid therapy, clinicians should collaborate with patients to evaluate and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioid therapy and exercise care when increasing, continuing, or reducing opioid dosage. Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and should work with patients to incorporate relevant strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone and reviewing potential interactions with any other prescribed medications or substances used. Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder.

ASIPP guidance — responsible opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain — outlines the guideline landscape, key emphases, and areas of controversy. Multiple guidelines have described steps for long term opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain, including HHS, CDC, VA/DoD, and Canadian guidance, and ASIPP has provided steps for appropriate practice patterns. CDC guidelines published in 2016 and updated in 2022 are described as largely unchanged and focused on behavioral aspects of chronic pain, while barriers to accessing therapeutic options include inadequate clinician education and training, unconscious bias, shortages of specialists, limited access to behavioral therapy, siloed health systems, insurance and reimbursement policies, and uncertainty about supporting evidence. The Pain Management Best Practices Interagency Task Force's final report published in May 2019 delineated updates and emphasized the need for true multidisciplinary approaches. VA/DoD guidelines were similarly formatted with 3 modules and 20 evidence-based recommendations covering appropriateness of care, initiation of treatment with opioids, and maintaining, tapering, discontinuing, or switching from full agonist opioids. Dowell et al. provided 12 recommendations spanning initiation to discontinuation of opioid therapy, including when to initiate or continue opioids; opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow-up, and discontinuation; and assessing risks and addressing harms. It has been difficult to assess the effect of published guidelines, and many believe recently published CDC guidelines will hinder access to patient care, with ongoing opposition from physician and patient groups.

### Changes in initial opioid prescribing practices after the 2016 release of the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^112VrpdE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Opioid prescribing began to increase in the US in the 1990s, continued to increase thereafter, and peaked in 2010, resulting in millions of people using opioids for pain management. Although the public health crisis of opioid overdose has evolved over time, with use of heroin and other synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl)increasing in relative importance in the past decade, prescription opioid overdose death rates have remained high. In addition, individuals receiving prescription opioids are at increased risk of developing opioid use disorder, with approximately 4 in 5 people who initiate heroin use having previously misused prescription opioids, and many patients presenting with heroin overdose have a history of having received an opioid prescription. Given these facts and the lack of evidence-based guidelines to encourage opioid stewardship, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the "Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain"in 2016 (hereafter, CDC guideline).

The voluntary CDC guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to encourage clinicians in primary care settings to use caution when prescribing opioids for adults with chronic, noncancer pain. The purpose of the guideline is to (1) improve patient-physician communication about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy, (2) enhance safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and (3) reduce risks of long-term opioid use. When opioids are prescribed, the CDC guideline provides recommendations on dosage and duration, including when opioids are used for acute pain prescribing for a period similar to the expected duration of severe pain (in which 3 days or less is often sufficient and more than 7 days is rarely needed) and the lowest daily dosage at which pain is reduced should be used (with special care taken surrounding dosages of 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] or more per day). How these recommendations corresponded to changes in prescribing for patients who are opioid naive, beyond just those affected by chronic pain, remains an open question.

Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain (Recommendations 1 and 2)

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^112sMBV8]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid guidelines — multimodal and multidisciplinary management is outlined with supporting evidence and CDC guidance. A randomized controlled trial of 521 patients with chronic low back pain showed that multi‑modal non‑pharmacological interventions (including cognitive therapy, mindfulness‑based stress reduction, and behavior therapy) produced reductions in pain and improvements in physical function, mood, and sleep disturbance. CDC guidelines support that multimodal therapies and multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation can reduce long‑term pain and disability, and they state that medications should ideally be combined with non‑pharmacologic therapies to enhance pain and function outcomes. CDC guidance also notes that less intense multidisciplinary rehabilitation can be as similarly effective as high intensity, and to consider combination of medications (such as 2 non‑opioid medications with different mechanisms of action or a non‑opioid with an opioid) as part of multidisciplinary management. Although short and intermediate outcomes have been indicative of clinical effectiveness, present evidence of long‑term efficacy of multidisciplinary pain care is limited, with a review reporting insufficient evidence for lumbar radiculopathy and a Cochrane review finding similar pain, disability, and work outcomes at 2-years between surgery and multi‑ or interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111vpjyP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who started opioid therapy for acute pain and are continuing to receive opioids for subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see Recommendation 2).

In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1–3 months than at 3–6 months. A cohort study found an association between longer duration of therapy and increased risk for new-onset depression. Because of potential changes in the balance of benefits and risks of opioid therapy over time, clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently. Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2). Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at greater risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation. In addition, policymakers can consider evidence-based methods of minimizing barriers to care (e.g. paid sick leave). In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted when available.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114bswKC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

Evaluation of the patient is critical to appropriate management. Evaluation can identify reversible causes of pain and underlying etiologies with potentially serious sequelae that require urgent action. To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can help identify interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g. surgical intervention to repair structure and function after certain traumatic injuries, bracing to prevent recurrence of acute ankle sprain, fracture immobilization, ice or elevation to reduce swelling, and early mobilization to maintain function).

Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Acute Pain

Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinical evidence reviews found that some nonpharmacologic treatments were likely effective for acute pain, such as heat therapy for acute low back pain; several others might be effective for specific acute pain conditions, such as spinal manipulation for acute back pain with radiculopathy, a cervical collar or exercise for acute neck pain with radiculopathy, acupressure for acute musculoskeletal pain, massage for postoperative pain, and remote electrical neuromodulation for acute pain related to episodic migraine.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as a cornerstone of treatment for acute low back pain. ACP and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) suggest acupressure to improve pain and function and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries.

Despite evidence supporting their use, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always or fully covered by insurance, and access and cost can be barriers, particularly for persons who are uninsured, have limited income, have transportation challenges, or live in rural areas where treatments are not available. Experts from OWG expressed concern about limited access to nonopioid pain management modalities, in part because of lack of availability or lack of coverage by payers, and emphasized improving access to nonopioid pain management modalities as a priority. Health insurers and health systems can contribute to improved pain management and reduced medication use by increasing access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence of effectiveness. Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches should be used as appropriate to alleviate acute pain, including ice and elevation to reduce swelling and discomfort from musculoskeletal injuries, heat to alleviate low back pain, and other modalities depending on the cause of the acute pain.

### Are prescription opioids driving the opioid crisis? Assumptions vs facts [^112WpCLN]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline for Chronic Pain

In March 2016, the CDC published an opioid prescribing guideline for chronic pain in primary care. Of its 12 recommendations, most represent standard practice, including risk mitigation strategies. A minority of these recommendations, however, provoked intense criticism and alarm by pain professionals and patient advocacy groups, and concerns by the American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Academy of Pain Management, American Academy of Pain Medicine, and other organizations. The CDC guidelines have already begun to have a major impact on opioid prescribing. Nonetheless, they perpetuate the misperceptions of opioid analgesics discussed above. Discussion of specific recommendations is beyond the scope of this paper, but aspects of the development process merit closer attention, as this shaped the contents of the end product.

Guideline recommendations can be influenced by the opinions, experience, and makeup of the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Instead of placing patient needs as the priority, practices can be regulated to control costs, serve societal needs, or protect special interests. Much of the opposition to the CDC guideline reflected the perception that it was not patient-centered.

The guideline notes that the current VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain "recommends against initiating long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain", that "Alternatives to opioid therapy… are the mainstay of management", and that "non-opioids are recommended over opioids". For patients who "do not have an adequate response to several non-pharmacologic and non-opioid therapies" and have "persistent, severe OA pain", a cautious, patient-centered opioid therapy approach "may be considered" for "carefully selected patients in which the benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks", and if opioids are prescribed, "it should be for the shortest duration and at the lowest effective dose" with "appropriate monitoring as per the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy is suggested". The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was "very low" and trials were short-term "1–17 weeks"; because of serious opioid risks, the Work Group concluded risks outweighed potential benefits, while benefits included "a modest reduction in pain intensity and improved function" that "have not been studied over the long-term and are likely not clinically significant". The Work Group acknowledged opioids "may be considered for certain patients" and issued a "Weak against" recommendation.

### CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain – United States, 2016 [^113sLZsH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Primary care clinicians find managing chronic pain challenging. Evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited. Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose.

Objective

To provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.

Process

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category.

Evidence Synthesis

Evidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥ 1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects.

Recommendations

There are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.

Conclusions and Relevance

The guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.

### Multimodal treatment patterns for osteoarthritis and their relationship to patient-reported pain severity: a cross-sectional survey in the United States [^1174RGHU]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

During this time, opioid prescriptions for patients with OA were common. There was growing alarm around the continuing opioid epidemic in the US with a rapidly rising incidence of deaths due to overdose. The majority of these deaths were associated with synthetic opioids, and there was increasing co-involvement with prescription opioids. Guidelines for the treatment of hip and knee OA were uncertain around recommending opioids due to the lack of high-quality data demonstrating clinically relevant efficacy in this population, the frequent incidence of side effects, and the clear risk of addiction. The 2012 ACR guidelines for hip, knee, and hand OA conditionally recommended the use of tramadol, whereas the 2008 OARSI guidelines (hip OA) recommended use of weak opioids in patients refractory to other analgesics and the use of strong opioids only in the management of severe pain.OARSI guidelines for knee OA (2014) were "uncertain" about recommending opioids. Furthermore, the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain state that nonopioid therapies are preferred and opioids should only be used (cautiously) when benefits outweigh the risks.

There is little published evidence reporting on the multimodal treatment patterns for patients with OA (the combination of prescribed, over-the-counter [OTC], and nonpharmacologic therapies). In view of the importance of pain relief in the treatment of OA and the concern around the use of opioids in this population, this study uniquely assessed the relationship between patient-reported pain severity and physician-determined multimodal treatment patterns in routine clinical practice in the US during 2017.

### Clinical indications associated with opioid initiation for pain management in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study [^113zPoLT]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

The use of prescription opioids has increased considerably over the past 2 decades, particularly in Canada and the United States, which had the highest level of opioid consumption per capita worldwide in 2015. High levels of opioid prescribing have raised concerns among clinicians and policymakers, given the limited evidence of long-term effectiveness of this class of drugs and research finding increased risks of adverse events including mortality with long-term use.

Previous research has associated long-term use of prescription opioids and dose escalation with worse outcomes. In turn, recently published clinical practice guidelines for chronic noncancer pain management recommended nonopioid alternatives as first-line and have suggested threshold doses for patients newly started on opioids. However, opioids are prescribed for a range of acute and chronic pain conditions, including arthritis, back pain, postsurgical pain, and dental pain. Studies in select populations have demonstrated that characteristics of opioid initiation and prescribing vary by clinical indication, which may reflect different anticipated needs for different indications as well as variations in training across specialties. Therefore, there has been an emerging recognition that policies and programs developed to address appropriate prescribing of opioids may need to be tailored to each clinical indication. This requires an understanding of the relative contribution of each clinical indication to patterns of opioid initiation. Previous studies investigating these indications have been limited to smaller populations.,

Accordingly, we set out to determine the apparent clinical indications for opioid initiation at the population level and to describe the characteristics of the initial prescriptions and patients by indication.

Scope of this guideline — purpose and evidence base: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is based on published clinical evidence and related information available through April 9, 2021, and is intended to provide general guidance on best evidence-based practices. It is not intended to serve as a standard of care and is intended to aid practitioners in understanding the state of evidence on the use of opioids for chronic pain; the use of guidelines must always be in the context of a health care provider's clinical judgment, and guidelines may be viewed as a tool to aid a practitioner in making evidence-based clinical decisions.

Deciding Duration of Initial Opioid Prescription and Conducting Follow-Up (Recommendations 6 and 7)

When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).
Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

Assessing Risk and Addressing Potential Harms of Opioid Use (Recommendations 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12)

Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and discuss risk with patients. Clinicians should work with patients to incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).
When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).
When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and nonprescribed controlled substances (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).
Clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system depressants (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).
Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).

Rationale

Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation. This evidence includes studies on misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, benefits and risks of different tapering strategies and rapid tapering associated with patient harm (,–), challenges in patient access to opioids, patient abandonment and abrupt discontinuation of opioids, a seminal randomized clinical trial comparing prescription opioids to nonopioid medications on long-term pain outcomes, the association of characteristics of initial opioid prescriptions with subsequent likelihood for long-term opioid use, and the small proportion of opioids used by patients compared with the amount prescribed to them for postoperative pain.

Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012. During 2015–2018, approximately 6% of U.S. adults reported use of one or more prescription opioids during the past 30 days, and in 2020, approximately 143 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed from pharmacies in the United States. Rates of opioid prescribing continue to vary across states, medical specialties, patient demographics, and pain conditions in ways that cannot be explained by the underlying health status of the population, and often are discordant with the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline recommendations (,–). The prevalence of prescription opioid misuse and prescription opioid use disorder also has declined in recent years. In 2019, among persons aged ≥ 12 years in the United States, 9.7 million reported misuse of prescription opioids during the past year (a decrease from 12.5 million in 2015), and 1.4 million met criteria for a past-year prescription opioid use disorder (a decrease from 2.0 million in 2015). However, in 2020, prescription opioids remained the most commonly misused prescription drug in the United States. Also in 2020, among those reporting misuse during the past year, 64.6% reported the main reason for their most recent misuse was to "relieve physical pain" compared with 11.3% to "feel good or get high" and 2.3% "because I am hooked or have to have it". Taken together, these factors underscore the need for an updated clinical practice guideline on appropriate opioid prescribing for pain and pain management.

Opioid analgesics can be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with chronic pain, but issues surrounding their use-including side effects, tolerance, and the potential for misuse and diversion-prompt some clinicians to avoid using these agents, and can lead to the continued undertreatment of pain. This article offers practical advice to clinicians who choose to prescribe opioid analgesics. Through a series of case presentations, it illustrates the steps health care providers can take to prepare their practice for opioid prescribing, assess and select patients for opioid treatment, initiate and manage therapy, and address concerns about aberrant behaviors.

The increase in overdose deaths from prescription opioids and heroin in the United States over the past 20 years is believed to have resulted from increases in prescription of opioids for management of acute and chronic pain. Managing chronic pain is challenging for primary care clinicians for many reasons, including the lack of evidence to guide practice. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a comprehensive guideline in 2016 to help clinicians with opioid prescribing for chronic pain. In this Grand Rounds, the guideline is reviewed and an expert discusses its application to 3 patients prescribed opioids to treat chronic pain.

Nonopioid Medications for Subacute and Chronic Pain

Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selected antidepressants and anticonvulsants) are used for painful symptoms in chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are associated with risks, particularly in older adults, pregnant patients, and patients with certain comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and liver disease. For example, NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events. Increases in nonserious adverse events have been found with anticonvulsants pregabalin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain, dizziness, and peripheral edema) and gabapentin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, and weight gain), cannabis (nausea and dizziness), and SNRI antidepressants duloxetine (nausea and sedation) and milnacipran (nausea); dosage reductions reduced the risk for some adverse events with SNRI antidepressants. Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.

For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs including topical NSAIDs and SNRI antidepressant duloxetine have small to moderate benefits for pain and function at short-term assessment (3–6 months), with intermediate-term (6–12 months) evidence for certain medications (celecoxib and duloxetine) and evidence that duloxetine is more effective in older (> 65 years) than younger patients and in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen has limited evidence for effectiveness and is no longer considered a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis. When patients have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g. exercise for arthritis pain), and if a single or a few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g. knee) are affected by osteoarthritis, use of topical NSAIDs is recommended. In patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled pain with topical NSAIDs, systemic NSAIDs or duloxetine can be used. However, systemic NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dosage and shortest duration needed because risks might increase with longer use and at higher dosages.

Managing patients with chronic pain on chronic opioid therapy (COT) can be challenging if done mainly by an individual clinician. A stepwise, systematic approach to managing patients on COT includes centering the discussion around safety for the patient. Treatment agreements and monitoring plans are important to safe prescribing. With a team-based care approach programs can be implemented, which optimize the benefits of opioid therapy and mitigate the risk. In these settings COT can be prescribed adhering to current guidelines in order to help achieve pain management, optimize function, and advance the patients' quality of life goals.

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^117Xmq77]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline on opioid prescribing suggests that clinicians "should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess the evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day". These recommendations are presented as "voluntary, rather than prescriptive standards", and the guideline asserts that "clinical decision-making should be based on a relationship between the clinician and patient and an understanding of the patient's clinical situation, functioning, and life context".

The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed concerns about the CDC guideline, including the potential for insurers and other payers to consider guideline recommendations as inflexible rules, rather than points for prescribers to consider, and use the recommendations to deny coverage. The guideline recommendations also may be used by pharmacies to deny prescriptions that exceed the recommended thresholds. State medical board opioid guidelines (eg, guidelines from the Federation of State Medical Boards)discourage clinicians from prescribing opioid dosages higher than the CDC guideline thresholds, and some payer policieslink the guideline to supply limits for opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. As a result, the guideline may have unintended consequences of not only creating barriers to initial prescription but also disrupting care in otherwise stable patients, even though the guideline itself notes that the dosing recommendations are less applicable to established patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy. Furthermore, reports from patients and health care providers corroborate the concerns about CDC guidelines expressed by the AMA.

The objective of this study, which was conducted after the publication of the CDC guidelines, was to assess the incidence and impact of opioid dose reduction on patients with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy.

### Updated centers for disease control and prevention guidelines on opioid prescribing: what should surgeons know? [^116i5wmJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published a 2022 guideline on opioid prescribing for acute, subacute, and chronic pain. This information is relevant to surgeons because many patients receive their first opioid prescription after surgery. When prescribing opioids, surgeons walk the line between benefit and harm. Many of the CDC recommendations mirror the AAO-HNS Clinical Practice Guideline: Opioid Prescribing for Analgesia After Common Otolaryngology Operations. For example, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pain from otolaryngology-head, and neck surgery procedures. New insights include safeguards and strategies to mitigate the risk of complications in patients with chronic pain undergoing surgical procedures. Consultation with a pain specialist should be considered for patients transitioning from acute to chronic pain, cognizant of the risks of abrupt discontinuation of opioids in patients with opioid use disorder. This article summarizes key considerations for providing individualized, evidence-based perioperative pain management.

Pharmacological management: acetaminophen — In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that when not contraindicated, oral acetaminophen may be considered to improve pain and function in the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip. Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. The systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this option, and the use of non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids. Although oral acetaminophen is widely utilized to treat osteoarthritis of the hip, there are contraindications to its use. Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with preexisting liver disease. Acetaminophen is widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip, this option should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice, and oral acetaminophen is widely available such that this option should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption.

### Opioid taper practices among clinicians [^114AVnVN]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently there are no consensus guidelines on how to safely and effectively taper or discontinue opioids. The available guidelines focus instead on safe and effective prescribing strategies. In 2016 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. The recommendations made were largely based on case series or expert opinion. Notably per the National Guideline Clearing House, these represent type 3 or 4 evidence, yet received a GRADE A recommendation. Moreover, these guidelines exist in a backdrop where prescription opioid deaths in persons to whom they were prescribed are not delineated from illicit opioid use, nor do we know if these deaths are from a single opioid or the combination of other agents, including but not limited to alcohol. As previously published in Practical Pain Management, by far the majority of opioid-related deaths over the last several years are clearly due to illicit fentalogues. Unfortunately, the CDC Opioid Guidelines have had adverse, unintended consequences, in part due to their misapplication, that have in and of themselves caused increased morbidity and mortality. This study seeks to assess prescribers interpretation and application of at least one portion of these guidelines.

This clinical practice guideline expands and updates the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations for prescribing opioid pain medication for acute, subacute, and chronic pain for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care (Boxes 1 and 2). Lessons learned from the development of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline informed the process used to generate this update. This update leverages new data to expand content on prescription opioids for acute and subacute pain throughout the recommendations. Importantly, the update also aims to clearly delineate recommendations that apply to patients who are being considered for initial treatment with prescription opioids and patients who have been receiving opioids as part of their ongoing pain management.

BOX 1
Executive summary of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain — United States, 2022

This clinical practice guideline updates and expands the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1–49]) and provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care and other clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners) providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years with acute (duration of < 1 month) pain, subacute (duration of 1–3 months) pain, or chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain. Recommendations on use of opioids for acute pain and on tapering opioids for patients already receiving opioid therapy have been substantially expanded in this update. These recommendations do not apply to patients experiencing pain associated with the following conditions or settings: pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Applicable outpatient settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to providing care to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management when patients are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.

Societal and Clinical Impact

The Institutes of Medicine's (IOM's) report Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research drew attention to pain as a major health problem and placed it on the national agenda. This report called for work to promote tangible objectives to advance pain treatment, education, and research and acknowledged that not all acute pain is being effectively managed. Such efforts are necessary because those with acute pain are currently not offered comprehensive, integrated, evidence-based assessment and treatments.

Acute pain has broader societal impact beyond the initial suffering imparted by the originating insult. Inadequately managed acute pain can lead to patient dissatisfaction, pathophysiologic sequelae, and maladaptive behaviors. With musculoskeletal conditions alone, one in four patients progresses from acute to chronic pain, contributing to serious long-term pain and pain-related physical disability. The US Department of Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on opioid prescriptions for chronic noncancer pain, both recently released, emphasize that chronic pain begins with acute pain. However, the transition from acute to chronic pain remains difficult to predict and little is known about how to prevent its development.

Conversely, unintended consequences of the treatment of acute pain can directly threaten patient safety. For example, there exists a wealth of data on the cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal adverse events associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and the risk of hepatic toxicity from over-the-counter analgesics containing acetaminophen remain a substantial public health problem. Public policy debates on acute pain in the United States have recently centered on opioid analgesics and their effects both on near-term patient safety (e.g. respiratory depression, cognitive dysfunction) and longer-term issues of opioid use disorders. It is well known that patients who develop opioid use disorders often have their first exposure to opioids during an acute pain episode. With increasing numbers of surgeries and the push to better control pain, there are concerning trends about increases in both number and dosage of opioid prescriptions following surgery and their contribution to the US opioid epidemic. Researchers have recently identified certain surgeries and patient vulnerabilities that are associated with increased likelihood of being on persistent opioids after surgery. However, much research is needed to determine if preventive strategies can reduce the development of opioid use disorders. An acute pain taxonomy would be an important part of that effort.

### Osteopathic manipulation in the management of chronic pain: current perspectives [^112w2Vur]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic Pain in the United States

The Institute of Medicine report on Relieving Pain in America in 2011 declared that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial condition that often requires integrated, multimodal, and interdisciplinary treatment, all components of which should be evidence-based. The National Pain Strategyand the Federal Pain Research Strategysubsequently developed coordinated approaches aimed at reducing the burden of pain in the United States. These clinical and research efforts both must be informed by and responsive to the biopsychosocial mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain, thereby leading to the development of safe and effective pain treatments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2016 for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. These guidelines recommended non-pharmacological treatment as an initial preferred approach for chronic pain management. The American College of Physicians subsequently issued a clinical practice guideline in 2017 that similarly recommended nonpharmacological treatment, including spinal manipulation, as the initial approach to patients with chronic low back pain. Despite such efforts and guidance over the past decade, the CDC recently estimated that 50 million adults in the United States suffer from chronic pain, including 20 million with high-impact chronic pain that interferes with work or life most days or every day. This narrative review provides current perspectives on the osteopathic approach to the management of chronic pain in the United States, including evidence for the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) based on systematic searches of the biomedical literature and the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113ZMsv1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is

a clinical tool to improve communication between clinicians and patients and empower them to make informed, person-centered decisions related to pain care together;
intended for primary care clinicians and other clinicians providing pain care for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years with acute pain (duration of < 1 month), subacute pain (duration of 1–3 months), or chronic pain (duration of > 3 months); and
intended to be flexible to enable person-centered decision-making, taking into account a patient's expected health outcomes and well-being.

This clinical practice guideline is not

a replacement for clinical judgment or individualized, person-centered care;
intended to be applied as inflexible standards of care across patients or patient populations by health care professionals, health systems, pharmacies, third-party payers, or governmental jurisdictions or to lead to the rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids for patients;
a law, regulation, or policy that dictates clinical practice or as a substitute for Food and Drug Administration–approved labeling;
applicable to management of pain related to sickle cell disease, management of cancer-related pain, or palliative care or end-of-life care; or
focused on opioids prescribed for opioid use disorder.

CDC developed a draft clinical practice guideline on the basis of five systematic reviews of the best-available evidence on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and nonpharmacologic treatments. The draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent federal advisory committee (the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control), peer reviewers, and the public and was revised after feedback from these reviews. Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care.
