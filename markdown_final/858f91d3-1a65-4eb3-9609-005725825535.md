## Question

What medications have mortality benefits in patients with CAD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications have mortality benefits in coronary artery disease and how to prioritize them by strength of evidence and clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical populations within CAD where mortality benefit is relevant, namely chronic coronary syndromes and acute coronary syndromes. Then, I should verify which drug classes have randomized or guideline-level evidence for reducing mortality. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for each class, including statins, antiplatelet therapy, RAAS inhibitors, beta-blockers, and SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in appropriate subgroups. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy and note caveats such as adherence, age, and comorbidities that modify benefit, anchoring to contemporary guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why mortality benefit matters differently across CAD phenotypes. In chronic coronary syndromes, optimal medical therapy is foundational and often sufficient, whereas in acute coronary syndromes, early initiation of evidence-based therapies and risk stratification drive outcomes; I need to ensure I separate mortality-proven therapies from those that improve symptoms or ischemia without clear survival benefit in stable disease.

> I will now examine statins, because I need to verify whether they reduce mortality in established CAD and whether intensity matters. High-intensity statins are recommended to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in chronic coronary disease, and meta-analytic data show that statins reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention populations, with the magnitude of LDL-C lowering correlating with event reduction; observational and trial syntheses also suggest mortality benefit across ages, including older adults, though confounding must be considered [^114h85Ug] [^1123Hsa5] [^111DuezT] [^113kA5zc].

> Wait, let me verify the antiplatelet evidence for mortality, not just MACE. Aspirin reduces all-cause mortality in secondary prevention cohorts and is guideline-recommended lifelong for chronic coronary disease absent contraindications; dual antiplatelet therapy after ACS or PCI reduces ischemic events but increases bleeding, so mortality benefit is nuanced and patient-specific, with guideline-endorsed durations tailored to ischemic versus bleeding risk [^112Lj4gQ] [^116PgChc] [^111hpv8v] [^111zMxq7].

> Next, I should review RAAS inhibition, and I need to check whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduce mortality in CAD with preserved LV function. A meta-analysis of randomized trials in CAD with preserved LV systolic function showed significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and myocardial infarction with ACE inhibitors, and the EUROPA trial with perindopril demonstrated a reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or cardiac arrest; contemporary guidelines endorse ACEi/ARB use broadly in chronic coronary disease, with particular emphasis in those with hypertension, diabetes, or CKD, and consider initiation even without these comorbidities in selected patients [^112fGAWG] [^117F4fYA] [^113K37CY] [^111yyMDk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about beta-blockers in stable CAD. I initially thought beta-blockers universally reduce mortality in CAD, but I should double-check the era and LV function context. Classic benefits were established in the prereperfusion era and in patients with LV dysfunction or recent MI; contemporary observational data and guideline updates suggest no clear mortality benefit in stable CAD without recent MI or LV dysfunction, prompting a recommendation to reassess beta-blocker use one year after MI if LVEF is preserved and no angina or arrhythmias persist [^112GFVEo] [^112RMdvd] [^117VTnAL].

> Let me consider SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and I should confirm whether their mortality benefit extends to CAD populations without diabetes. In patients with chronic coronary disease and type 2 diabetes, both SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality, and SGLT-2 inhibitors also reduce cardiovascular mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction irrespective of diabetes; for CAD without diabetes, evidence is evolving, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond guideline-supported indications [^113XFgrG] [^115A3Tra] [^113arzJf].

> I should confirm the role of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors on mortality, because clinicians often ask about add-on therapy. While ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors further reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular events on top of statins, large outcome trials have not demonstrated a consistent reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality when added to statins, so their role is in event reduction and risk modification rather than proven mortality benefit per se [^113kA5zc] [^115uyZ89].

> But wait, what if the patient has nonobstructive CAD or angina without recent infarction; do any of these drugs still help with mortality. Observational and mechanistic data support statins and RAAS blockade for risk reduction in nonobstructive CAD, but mortality evidence is limited; guideline statements allow individualized use of preventive pharmacotherapy while we await definitive trials, so I should tailor therapy to risk enhancers and plaque features rather than assume equivalent mortality benefit [^113UqbxE] [^1149ELNQ].

> Next, I should review adherence, because medication-taking behavior modifies mortality benefits in real-world CAD. Meta-analyses show that a 20% improvement in adherence to cardiovascular medications is associated with roughly a 12% reduction in all-cause mortality, with the clearest adherence–mortality signal for statins, ACEi/ARBs, and antiplatelet agents; simplifying regimens and addressing barriers can materially change outcomes at the population level [^112KAGy1] [^1157LUDe] [^1153HqLf].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy, and I should double-check that each tier aligns with guidelines and mortality data. Tier 1 with robust mortality benefit in established CAD includes high-intensity statins, aspirin in appropriate secondary prevention contexts, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in CAD with preserved LV function; Tier 2 with strong event reduction and conditional mortality benefit in selected subgroups includes SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes or heart failure; Tier 3 includes ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors for LDL-C lowering and event reduction without definitive mortality benefit, and beta-blockers reserved for recent MI, LV dysfunction, angina, or arrhythmias rather than routine use in stable CAD without these features [^114h85Ug] [^116PgChc] [^112fGAWG] [^113XFgrG] [^112RMdvd].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical implementation details are addressed. Initiate or uptitrate statins to high intensity when tolerated, start low-dose aspirin lifelong if no contraindication, add an ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, layer in SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist for eligible patients with diabetes, and reassess beta-blocker continuation one year post-MI if LVEF is preserved and symptoms are controlled; throughout, monitor adherence, interactions, and adverse effects, especially in older adults where polypharmacy and frailty complicate management [^115kuAvy] [^113arzJf] [^1153Fp62].

---

In coronary artery disease (CAD), **high-intensity statins** [^114h85Ug] reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and are first-line therapy [^114h85Ug]. Aspirin [^116PgChc] lowers mortality in secondary prevention [^112Lj4gQ] and is recommended lifelong after MI or revascularization [^111hpv8v]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduce mortality in CAD with LV dysfunction or hypertension [^112fGAWG] and are reasonable in others [^113K37CY]. Beta-blockers reduce mortality post-MI and in CAD with LV dysfunction, but not in stable CAD without these features [^112GFVEo]. SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce mortality in CAD with diabetes or heart failure [^113XFgrG] [^113arzJf]. Combination therapy yields additive benefits [^1118Djij], and adherence is critical to realize mortality gains [^112KAGy1].

---

## Statins

- **Evidence**: High-intensity statins reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CAD [^116LdZ2k].
- **Guidelines**: Initiate high-intensity statins [^114h85Ug] to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction; use moderate intensity if high-intensity is not tolerated [^1137rgBc].
- **Additional benefit**: Add ezetimibe [^115uyZ89] or PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statins [^notfound].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

- **Evidence**: Aspirin reduces mortality in secondary prevention [^111wE4gP] and is recommended lifelong after MI or revascularization [^111hpv8v].
- **Guidelines**: Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) [^116PgChc] is first-line unless contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Reduces mortality after ACS or PCI [^notfound]; tailor duration to ischemic and bleeding risk [^112jKQVu].

---

## Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)

ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduce mortality in CAD with **LV dysfunction or hypertension** [^notfound]. Guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors or ARBs for patients with **LVEF ≤ 40%**, **hypertension**, **diabetes**, or **CKD** [^notfound]; consider in others [^113K37CY].

---

## Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers reduce mortality post-MI and in CAD with **LV dysfunction** [^117VTnAL]. Guidelines recommend beta-blockers post-MI or in CAD with **LV dysfunction**; re-evaluate use in stable CAD without these features [^112RMdvd].

---

## Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors

SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce mortality in CAD with **diabetes or heart failure** [^116sGCcH] [^115A3Tra]. Guidelines recommend SGLT-2 inhibitors for CAD with **T2DM** or **HF**, regardless of diabetes status [^115A3Tra].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy provides **additive mortality benefits** [^1118Djij] versus monotherapy. Clinical implication: Use **guideline-directed medical therapy** [^115kuAvy] to maximize mortality reduction [^112KNgcA].

---

## Impact of medication adherence on mortality

Greater adherence is associated with **lower mortality** [^112KAGy1]. Clinical implication: Simplify regimens [^1153HqLf] and address barriers to improve adherence [^116jAkYa].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Statins and ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, but monitor for side effects and interactions [^1153Fp62].
- **Women**: Similar relative benefits from statins and ACE inhibitors; absolute benefits may be greater due to higher risk [^114uc167].
- **Diabetes**: SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists provide additional mortality benefit [^116sGCcH].

### Revascularization in stable coronary artery disease [^114rj45N]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) centers on medication to prevent myocardial infarction and death. Many anti-anginal medications also have benefit for reducing symptoms, and have been proven to be effective against placebo control. Before effective preventive medications were available, patients with stable CAD often underwent revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), on the plausible assumption that these procedures would prevent adverse events and reduce symptoms. However, recent randomized controlled trials have cast doubt on these assumptions. Considering results from the recent ISCHEMIA trial, we discuss the evidence base that underpins revascularization for stable CAD in contemporary practice. We also focus on patient groups at high risk of myocardial infarction and death, for whom revascularization is often recommended. We outline the areas of uncertainty, unanswered research questions, and key areas of potential miscommunication in doctor-patient consultations.

### Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^116QQTdL]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. In patients who have had a myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure, secondary prevention of coronary artery disease by comprehensive risk factor modification reduces mortality, decreases subsequent cardiac events, and improves quality of life. Options for secondary prevention include medical therapy and surgical revascularization in the form of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention. Medical therapy focuses on comprehensive risk factor modification. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (including weight management, physical activity, tobacco cessation, and dietary modification) improve cardiac risk factors and are universally recommended by evidence-based guidelines. Treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia reduces morbidity and mortality. Recommendations for persons with diabetes mellitus generally encourage glucose control, but current evidence has not shown reductions in mortality with intensive glucose management. Aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers reduce recurrent cardiac events in patients after myocardial infarction. Surgical revascularization by coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended for those with significant left main coronary artery stenosis, significant stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery, multivessel coronary disease, or disabling angina. Percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered in select patients with objective evidence of ischemia demonstrated by noninvasive testing.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^112KAGy1]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta‐analysis that quantitively analyzes the effect of cardiovascular medication adherence on outcomes among patients with CAD in a real‐world setting. By incorporating 18 prospective studies with 402 201 patients, we novelty found a 20% cardiovascular medication adherence unit increased could reduce the risk for cardiovascular events by 8% and all‐cause mortalities by 12%, respectively. Furthermore, by using incidence rates from the general US population, we found the absolute risk difference associated with per 20% medication adherence to cardiovascular medication was 93 per 1 million cardiovascular cases per year and 140 per 1 million all‐cause death. This meta‐analysis strengthens and extends the understanding of the positive impact of cardiovascular medication adherence on secondary prevention among people with CAD, further supporting the notion that improved cardiovascular medication adherence was associated with better outcomes in patients with CAD.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease [^115Li6ow]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Statin therapy: where are we? Where do we go next? [^111U5HL4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials including patients with elevated and average cholesterol levels. The association between reduction of total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preventive benefit is well established. However, additional risk factors for coronary artery disease need to be incorporated into risk assessment to provide an accurate measure of global risk for use in lifestyle intervention and drug therapy guidelines. Assessment of outcomes in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study primary prevention trial, which involved patients with average cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), suggests the importance of on-treatment values of apolipoproteins B and A-I in predicting first major events in such a population. Other data, including trials of fibrate therapy showing reduction in coronary artery disease events, support the importance of triglycerides and HDL-C in coronary artery disease risk. Challenges for future treatment guidelines include incorporation of emerging and novel risk factors into risk assessment, refinement of global risk measurement, and simplification for application to clinical practice.

### Controversies in cardiovascular medicine: chronic stable coronary artery disease: drugs vs. revascularization [^117ASSko]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of mortality in most industrialized countries, although age-standardized mortality related to coronary artery disease (CAD) has decreased by more than 40% during the last two decades. Coronary atherosclerosis may cause angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death. Medical management of atherosclerosis and its manifestation aims at retardation of progression of plaque formation, prevention of plaque rupture, and subsequent events and treatment of symptoms, when these occur as well as treatment of the sequelae of the disease. Revascularization by either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is performed as treatment of flow-limiting coronary stenosis to reduce myocardial ischaemia. In high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), a routine invasive strategy with revascularization in most patients provides the best outcome with a significant reduction in death and myocardial infarction compared with an initial conservative strategy. Conversely, the benefit of revascularization among patients with chronic stable CAD has been called into question. This review will provide information that revascularization exerts favourable effects on symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and survival, particularly in those with extensive CAD and documented moderate-to-severe ischaemia. Accordingly, CABG and PCI should be considered a valuable adjunct rather than an alternative to medical therapy.

### Managing dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^115CgYx7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD > 20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels > 130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to < 100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.

### Prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease: who benefits? [^116QTxya]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, despite our better understanding of the pathobiology of atherosclerosis, our knowledge of risk factors, the widespread availability of inexpensive cholesterol screening, and the availability of effective and well-tolerated cholesterol-lowering agents. Advances in these areas have created controversies regarding who should be screened and treated for primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. The advent of the statin class of lipid-lowering agents represented a major advance, because they are much more effective and better tolerated than previous agents. There is general agreement that patients with hypercholesterolemia and established CHD require treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent coronary events. Primary prevention is controversial in all patient groups except those with diabetes, because their risk of developing CHD is dramatically increased. Postmenopausal women and the elderly are undertreated, whereas young adults may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Several ongoing trials may resolve the controversies about which patient groups will benefit from different prevention and treatment strategies.

### Optimal medical therapy for known coronary artery disease: a review [^1162TXpQ]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

This review examines the current state-of-the-art optimal medical therapy (OMT) for patients with known coronary artery disease. This therapy, which is sometimes labeled as secondary prevention, is effective in preventing recurrent events and is recommended by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines. Optimal medical therapy is of recognized public health benefit.

Observations

The available evidence from broad patient populations, contemporary randomized trials, and multiple recent studies with pharmacy records indicates that the delivery of OMT is far from ideal. We suggest approaches for quality improvement, including better patient education, the increased use of interventions that are known to improve compliance, and the use of performance measures focused on long-term OMT in outpatient care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Improvement in the delivery of OMT to patients with coronary artery disease is one possible step to help the United States reduce the recently reported increase in death rate from heart disease.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^113arzJf]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits in patients with T2DM and chronic coronary syndrome to reduce cardiovascular events, independent of baseline or target HbA1c and independent of concomitant glucose-lowering medication.

### Strategies for the prevention of coronary artery disease complications: can we Do better? [^112K46mM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Billions of dollars have been spent over the past 25 years on developing new therapies for the prevention/treatment of adverse cardiac events related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although some therapies have been lifesaving, several mega-randomized studies have shown only a < 2% absolute reduction in adverse events with a large residual event rate. Is all this money well spent? Atherosclerosis develops decades before an adverse event, and the trials previously alluded to have nearly always been applied to secondary prevention, decades after disease initiation. Will earlier intervention result in a lower incidence of events? Individuals with an absence of the usual cardiac risk factors have a lifelong low incidence of events. Early initiation of strategies against the common cardiovascular risk factors in primary or primordial prevention will lower the incidence of adverse events, although many groups have not been well studied, including individuals younger than 40 years of age. New strategies are required to realize a radical reduction in events, and this article proposes new methods of prevention/treatment for coronary artery disease complications.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^1157LUDe]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular medications are vital for the secondary prevention of coronary arterial disease (CAD). However, the effect of cardiovascular medication may depend on the optimal adherence of the patients. This meta-analysis aims to determine the magnitude of adherence to vascular medications that influences the absolute and relative risks (RRs) of mortality in patients with CAD in real-world settings.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched through March 1, 2022. Prospective studies reporting association as RR and 95% confidence interval between cardiovascular medication adherence and any cardiovascular events and/or all-cause mortality in patients with CAD were included. A one-stage robust error meta-regression method was used to summarize the dose-specific relationships.

Results

A total of 18 studies were included. There is a significant inverse linear association between cardiovascular medication adherence and cardiovascular events (p nonlinearity = .68) or mortality (p nonlinearity = .82). The exposure-effect analysis showed that an improvement of 20% cardiovascular medication adherence was associated with 8% or 12% lower risk of any cardiovascular events or mortality, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the benefit was observed in adherence of stain (RR: 0.90, for cardiovascular events, RR: 0.85, for mortality), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)(RR: 0.90, for mortality), and antiplatelet agent (RR: 0.89 for mortality) but not in beta-blocker (RR: 0.90, p = .14, for cardiovascular events, RR: 0.97, p = .32 for mortality). Estimated absolute differences per 1 million individuals per year for mortality associated with 20% improvement were 175 cases for statin, 129 cases for antiplatelet, and 117 cases for ACEI/ARB.

Conclusion

Evidence from the real word showed poor adherence to vascular medications contributes to a considerable proportion of all cardiovascular disease events and mortality in patients with CAD.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^112JLj2C]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronary arterial disease (CAD) is a highly prevalent disease, associated with increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. Cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitos (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), beta‐blockers, antiplatelet agents, and statins, remain the most common medical interventions worldwide for the prevention of CAD. Although their beneficial effects have been established in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), their effort in real‐world settings is inferior to that seen in random control trials (RCT), and this has been partly attributed to poor medication adherence. According to a recent study, almost 31% of myocardial infarction (MI) patients are no longer persistent with their prescribed medications by 6 months. A meta‐analysis that included 1 978 919 patients showed that only 60% of patients were adherence to their cardiovascular medications. Additionally, compared with good adherence, the risk of cardiovascular events or mortality in those with poor adherence increased by 20% or 35%, respectively.

A systematic evaluation of the association between cardiovascular medication adherence and the outcomes in patients with CAD is of significance for understanding the role of medication adherence in secondary prevention. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of adherence and their outcomes could provide more detailed guidelines and education information for patients with cardiovascular medication to have better outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular events and mortality). However, the quantitative association between cardiovascular medication adherence and long‐term outcomes in patients with CAD remains to be determined. Moreover, considering well‐designed RCTs might not reflect the actual adherence level or effectiveness of medication therapy in the "real" community. We conducted an exposure‐effect meta‐analysis based on prospective observational studies to (i) quantitatively investigate the relationship between adherence to cardiovascular medication and outcomes in patients with CAD in real‐world settings and (ii) estimate the future absolute risk for cardiovascular events or mortality for suboptimum adherence to cardiovascular medication.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^113R1j7N]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In general, the impact of age on "statin adherence" in the secondary prevention of CAD remains controversial. Actually, statins are generally not sufficient to recommend among older patients (aged ≥ 75) with known CVD by current guidelines. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelinerecommend and the US Preventive Services Task Force did not recommend it. A recent meta‐analysis of RCTs showed significant reductions in major coronary events in all age groups (including those older than 75 years) among participants with known vascular disease. However, in a propensity‐adjusted analysis of real‐world data, Rothschild et al.found statin therapy had no significant effect on long‐term survival in older adults hospitalized patients with CAD, but without adjustment for medication adherence. In contrast, another observational study based on patients withatherosclerotic CVD found high‐intensity statins were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with moderate‐intensity statins (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94) compared with those receiving submaximal doses. In the current study, we found that good adherence was associated with reduced mortality in patients with CAD regardless of age (< 65 or > 65 years), which suggested the benefit of statins persisted in older patients with CAD. However, due to the scarcity of data, we can't perform a subgroup analysis based on sex over 75 years. Therefore, the benefit of the effect of good adherence to statin in CAD patients with older age needs to be further investigated.

### Coronary artery disease prevention: what's different for women? [^114uc167]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women, as well as an important cause of disability, although many women and their physicians underestimate the risk. Exercise, hypertension treatment, smoking cessation and aspirin therapy are effective measures for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease in women. The roles of lipid-lowering agents and hormone replacement therapy in primary prevention are not well established. In secondary prevention, hormone replacement therapy has not been effective in lowering the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction, but several lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce this risk and to lower mortality rates in women with known coronary artery disease. Other secondary prevention measures, including aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, revascularization and rehabilitation, have proven benefits in women but are underused, especially in minority women. Family physicians should emphasize the use of proven treatments, with particular attention given to underserved populations.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^1173teWu]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Medication adherence has been defined as the extent to which a patient takes medications as prescribed by their healthcare providers. In clinical practice, medication nonadherence is one of the main factors that reduce the effectiveness of drug therapies. However, a previous study reported that almost 40% of the patients who initiated the use of ACEIs/ARBs, beta‐blockers, or statins following hospitalization for MI became nonadherent during the first treatment year. Moreover, many patients seemed to do so already during the first 6 months. Therefore, better adherence to cardiovascular treatment should be highlighted in the clinical secondary prevention in patients with CAD.

We subsequently found the inverse association between cardiovascular medication adherence and outcomes in patients with CAD risk was found. A 20% improvement in cardiovascular medication adherence was associated with an 8% reduction in cardiovascular case risk. In addition, this cardiovascular event risk reduction would be translated into a reduction of all‐cause mortality (decreased by 12%). However, this benefit was not observed in good beta‐blocker adherence. This reason might be the majority of the included sample were patients with post‐MI. Recently, several studies reported that beta‐blocker might have no benefit on post‐AMI patients without heart failure or ventricular dysfunction (so‐called reperfusion era). Actually, the evidence of benefits associated with beta‐blocker use is mostly from trials predating the advent of the era of early revascularization. A meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials also showed that beta‐blocker use has no mortality benefit for patients without heart failure. Another study also showed patients adherent to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and statins only had similar mortality rates as those adherents to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and statins and beta‐blocker, suggesting a limited additional benefit for beta‐blockers in patients with post‐MI. By combining evidence from observational studies, a systematic review suggested that the majority of the included studies failed to demonstrate a benefit in survival or cardiovascular events with long‐term beta‐blockers in post‐MI patients with normal left ventricular function. However, because of a lack of or limited data, subgroup analysis by subtypes of heart failure was not available. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of beta‐blockers adherence on the outcomes in post‐MI patients (especially in patients with normal left ventricular function).

### The benefit of cholesterol-lowering medications after coronary revascularization: a population study [^116VfMMJ]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical trials, cholesterol-lowering medications have been proven to decrease mortality and morbidity and are strongly recommended as secondary prevention in patients with established coronary artery disease. In routine practice, the translation of these benefits to elderly patients with recent coronary revascularization is less well known.

Methods

Using the provincial computerized administrative databases of the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec, we identified all elderly patients (> 65 years old) in Quebec, Canada, discharged alive after a coronary revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft) between April 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, and determined the percentage fulfilling prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering drug therapy. Time-dependent multivariable models examined the clinical end points of total mortality, acute myocardial infarctions, and repeat coronary revascularizations as a function of cholesterol-lowering drug exposure. Patients were followed up until death or December 31, 1999.

Results

We identified 11958 elderly patients who had a coronary revascularization between April 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997. During an average 3-year follow-up, users of cholesterol-lowering medications had a decreased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.96] or myocardial infarction (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54–1.11) but no reduction in repeat revascularizations (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88–1.28).

Conclusions

In this population-based study of recently revascularized elderly patients, we observed health benefits associated with the use of cholesterol-lowering medications of similar size to those seen in randomized clinical trials. The translation of these benefits from clinical trials to a nonselected population of revascularized patients emphasizes the importance of this aspect of secondary prevention in clinical practice.

### Management of stable patients with coronary heart disease: clinical implications of the clinical outcomes utilizing revascularization and aggressive drug evaluation (COURAGE) trial [^116KPZ7H]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

Early coronary revascularization has been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), however, coronary revascularization does not reduce death or myocardial infarction compared to intensive medical therapy. The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial was the first to study whether coronary revascularization performed in addition to medical therapy, rather than as an alternative, would reduce death or myocardial infarction in patients with stable CHD. Between 1999 and 2004, 2287 patients were enrolled in 50 centers throughout Canada and the United States. After a median follow-up of 4.6 years, revascularization performed in addition to intensive medical therapy did not result in reduced mortality or myocardial infarction compared to medical therapy alone. At the end of follow-up, anginal control was similar in both groups, although patients receiving medical therapy only did require more antianginal medications, and one-third ultimately required revascularization. We review the strengths, limitations, and clinical relevance of the COURAGE trial in the context of the current literature on the benefits of medical management and coronary revascularization in patients with stable CHD.

### Dose-response associations of lipid traits with coronary artery disease and mortality [^113kA5zc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Lipid management is essential for preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is emerging as the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological associations of lipid traits with coronary artery disease (CAD). An association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with CAD is widely accepted, and an association of triglycerides (TG) with CAD is also gaining acceptance. However, dose-response associations of these lipid traits with CAD and mortality remain unclear.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that lowering LDL-C reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality, and intensive LDL-C lowering further reduces CVD events compared with standard LDL-C lowering. However, no reduction in all-cause mortality or CVD mortality has been shown in trials comparing more intensive and less intensive statin therapy, or in trials adding PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin and kexin type 9) inhibitorsor ezetimibeto background statin therapy. Meta-regression of RCTs suggests the magnitude of LDL-C lowering is associated with greater reduction in all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in trials of people with higher baseline LDL-C.RCTs have shown therapies primarily lowering TG (ie, fibrates and omega-3 supplements) reduce CVD events but have little detectable effect on all-cause mortality or CVD mortality. Previous studies have shown adverse associations of lipid modifiers with myopathy, liver enzyme elevation, and type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these studies raise the question about the balance of risks and benefits for lipid lowering, particularly for groups with low baseline LDL-C or TG, as well as for women (who have lower CVD risk than men), and for older people (who generally have more non-CVD comorbidities than younger people).

### Β-blockers, calcium antagonists, and mortality in stable coronary artery disease: an international cohort study [^112vssdy]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-blockers and calcium antagonists are recommended for treatment of angina in patients with stable coronary disease (CAD). They are widely used in stable CAD, including angina free patientseven though their role in improving outcomes remains uncertain. Large observational series have shown association of β-blocker use with improved outcomes in acute coronary syndromes.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) established unequivocal benefits of β-blockers in chronic heart failure with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunctionand in relatively old trials in acute myocardial infarction (MI), but no trials assessed their benefit compared with placebo in stable CAD. Thus, the question was investigated in observationaland post hoc trial analyses.

Regarding calcium antagonists, there are no data supporting a benefit on mortality and a few trials supporting a benefit on cardiovascular morbidity compared with placebo in stable CAD. Trials comparing long-acting dihydropyridinesor non-dihydropyridineswith β-blockers in stable CAD found no difference in clinical outcomes.

In the absence of RCTs, we assessed the association between β-blocker or calcium antagonist use and clinical outcomes, focusing on mortality, in the prospective observational longitudinal registry of patients with stable CAD (CLARIFY; ISRCTN43070564) acknowledging that residual confounding factors from measured or unmeasured variables can persist even after adjustment.

### Epidemiology of coronary artery disease [^114Y2esJ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the mortality of coronary artery disease (CAD) has declined over recent decades, CAD remains the leading cause of death in the United States (US) and presents a significant economic burden. Epidemiologic studies have identified numerous risk factors for CAD. Some risk factors-including smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and physical inactivity-are decreasing within the US population while Others, including advanced age, diabetes, and obesity are increasing. The most significant historic advances in CAD therapy were the development of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and lipid-lowering medications. Contemporary management of CAD includes primary and secondary prevention via medical management and revascularization when appropriate based on best available evidence. Despite the increasing prevalence of CAD nationwide, there has been a steady decline in the number of CABGs and PCIs performed in the US for the past decade. Patients with CABG are becoming older and with more comorbid conditions, although mortality associated with CABG has remained steady.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^111ph6Ma]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major cause of death in the developed world. 1 Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) constitutes the most severe clinical manifestation of CAD and includes unstable angina, non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and ST‐segment–elevation MI. Recent data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute suggest that the annual incidence of MI in the United States is 805 000. 2 The treatment of ACS has progressed tremendously since the 1950s and 1960s when it was associated with in‐hospital mortality as high as 30%. 3 By determining the underlying pathophysiological features and conducting large‐scale randomized controlled trials, the management of ACS evolved and in‐hospital mortality was reduced to ≈3% to 8%. 4 Nonetheless, in the current era, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5‐year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. 5, 6 Even when nonemergent and uncomplicated, repeated revascularization following percutaneous coronary intervention has been associated with long‐term mortality. 7, 8, 9 A recurrent ACS is associated with increased mortality to an even greater extent. 10 There are limits to the amount of antithrombotic medication that can be prescribed for secondary prevention, as increased intensity of antithrombotic therapy decreases recurrent ischemic events at the cost of increased bleeding events, which are also associated with subsequent mortality. 10

As lipids play a critical role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis lesions, obtaining a significant reduction of the lipid‐related risk has long been a crucial aspect of secondary prevention following ACS. Several additions to the available arsenal of lipid‐lowering therapies have recently been made or will soon be made, leaving clinicians with various therapeutic strategies to be used according to the clinical setting. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid‐lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid‐lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1134Xgzh]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antiplatelet therapy represents the mainstay of the pharmacological treatment and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared with placebo, antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with stable CAD or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) provides more intense platelet inhibition than single antiplatelet therapy resulting in incremental reductions in the risk of thrombotic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or ACS, but it has been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. The choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. However, the selection of patients who might derive benefit from shorter or extended DAPT duration remains a matter of debate. This article provides a contemporary state-of-the-art review of the current evidence on DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD and its future perspectives.

### Coronary artery disease in patients ≥ 80 years of age [^116bFiMF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients ≥ 80 years of age. Nonetheless, older patients have typically been under-represented in cardiovascular clinical trials. Understanding the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and optimal means of diagnosis and treatment of CAD in older adults is crucial to improving outcomes in this high-risk population. A patient-centered approach, taking into account health status, functional ability and frailty, cognitive skills, and patient preferences is essential when caring for older adults with CAD. The present systematic review focuses on the current knowledge base, gaps in understanding, and directions for future investigation pertaining to CAD in patients ≥ 80 years of age.

### Relation of different measures of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to risk of coronary artery disease and death in a meta-regression analysis of large-scale trials of statin therapy [^1128rUUi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The benefits observed are often framed in terms of percentage reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline or percentage reductions between control and treatment groups, although epidemiologic data suggest that the absolute intergroup difference in LDL cholesterol (DeltaLDL(Control-Rx)) is the more informative measure. A systematic review of large-scale trials of statins versus placebo, usual care, or active (lower dose statin) control was conducted to calculate updated summary estimates of risk reduction in coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to ascertain the relations of different LDL cholesterol metrics to outcomes. In 20 eligible RCTs, there were significant overall reductions for coronary artery disease (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.78) and mortality (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.94), but with substantial variability in trial results. DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) was the strongest determinant of coronary artery disease risk reduction, particularly after excluding active-comparator studies, and was independent of baseline LDL cholesterol. In contrast, baseline LDL cholesterol edged out DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) as the strongest determinant of mortality, but neither was significant after the exclusion of active-comparator studies. The exclusion of 3 RCTs involving distinct populations, however, rendered DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) the predominant determinant of mortality reduction. In conclusion, these findings underscore the primacy of absolute reductions in LDL cholesterol in the design and interpretation of RCTs of lipid-lowering therapies and in framing treatment recommendations on the basis of the proved coronary benefits of these drugs.

### Aspirin use and all-cause mortality among patients being evaluated for known or suspected coronary artery disease: a propensity analysis [^112Lj4gQ]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and short-term mortality following acute myocardial infarction, the association between its use and long-term all-cause mortality has not been well defined.

Objectives

To determine whether aspirin is associated with a mortality benefit in stable patients with known or suspected coronary disease and to identify patient characteristics that predict the maximum absolute mortality benefit from aspirin.

Design and Setting

Prospective, nonrandomized, observational cohort study conducted between 1990 and 1998 at an academic medical institution, with a median follow-up of 3.1 years.

Patients

Of 6174 consecutive adults undergoing stress echocardiography for evaluation of known or suspected coronary disease, 2310 (37%) were taking aspirin. Patients with significant valvular disease or documented contraindication to aspirin use, including peptic ulcer disease, renal insufficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were excluded.

Main Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality according to aspirin use.

Results

During 3.1 years of follow-up, 276 patients (4.5%) died. In a simple univariable analysis, there was no association between aspirin use and mortality (4.5% vs 4.5%). However, after adjustment for age, sex, standard cardiovascular risk factors, use of other medications, coronary disease history, ejection fraction, exercise capacity, heart rate recovery, and echocardiographic ischemia, aspirin use was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.87; p = 0.002). In further analysis using matching by propensity score, 1351 patients who were taking aspirin were at lower risk for death than 1351 patients not using aspirin (4% vs 8%, respectively; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.74; p = 0.002). After adjusting for the propensity for using aspirin, as well as other possible confounders and interactions, aspirin use remained associated with a lower risk for death (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40–0.78; P < .001). The patient characteristics associated with the most aspirin-related reductions in mortality were older age, known coronary artery disease, and impaired exercise capacity.

Conclusion

Aspirin use among patients undergoing stress echocardiography was independently associated with reduced long-term all-cause mortality, particularly among older patients, those with known coronary artery disease, and those with impaired exercise capacity.

### Medical therapy versus myocardial revascularization in chronic coronary syndrome and stable angina [^114aNenx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. Angina is encountered frequently in clinical practice. Effective management of patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina should consist of therapy aimed at symptom control and reduction of adverse clinical outcomes. Therapeutic options for angina include antianginal drugs: nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and myocardial revascularization. Recent trials have shown that although revascularization is slightly better in controlling symptoms, optimal medical therapy that includes aggressive risk factor modification is equally effective in reducing the risk of future coronary events and death. On the basis of the available data, it seems appropriate to prescribe optimal medical therapy in most patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, and reserve myocardial revascularization for selected patients with disabling symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.

### Cardiac mortality in patients randomised to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115GtTVd]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease is the most prevalent medical condition worldwide among individuals 50 years or older in terms of disease burden, disability, or early death. Chronic coronary syndromes encompass clinically stable coronary artery disease patients, with or without acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or coronary revascularisation procedures in their natural history. Compared with medical therapy alone, timely revascularisation of epicardial artery obstructions with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% has been demonstrated to confer survival advantage. In clinically stable patients with preserved or moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function, symptomatic benefit favouring revascularisation is well known, but controversy remains regarding prognosis. Significant effects on cardiac mortality of one or the other strategy have not been reported so far. Moreover, no meta-analysis has comprehensively included data at longest follow-up for each available study.

The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial, the largest and most recent randomised comparison of coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone in 5179 patients with stable coronary syndromes and moderate or severe inducible myocardial ischaemia, showed a non-significant difference between the two strategies for the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, hospitalisation for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest at a median follow-up of 3.2 years; at 5 years, the estimated cumulative composite event rates were 16.4% with revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. 18.2% with medical therapy alone, suggesting potential benefit with revascularisation at longer follow-up; the trial lacked statistical power to be conclusive on cardiac-related mortality. In the Fractional flow reserve vs. Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2 (FAME-2) study of 888 patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenoses, the 5-year primary endpoint of death/MI/urgent revascularisation was significantly reduced, with lower rates of spontaneous MI, in the revascularisation plus medical therapy compared with the medical therapy alone arm.

We conducted a meta-analysis of all trials comparing elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone in patients with preserved or moderately impaired left ventricular ejection fraction to appraise whether revascularisation in addition to medical therapy affects cardiac mortality at longest follow-up.

### Personalised antiplatelet therapies for coronary artery disease: what the future holds [^114YMvt2]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death globally, and antiplatelet therapy is crucial for both its prevention and treatment. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors are commonly used to reduce the risk of thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis. However, the benefits associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs also come with a risk of bleeding complications. The ever-growing understanding of the poor prognostic implications associated with bleeding has set the foundations for defining strategies that can mitigate such safety concern without any trade-off in antithrombotic protection. To this extent, personalised antiplatelet therapy has emerged as a paradigm that optimizes the balance between safety and efficacy by customizing treatment to the individual patient's needs and risk profile. Accurate risk stratification for both bleeding and thrombosis can aid in selecting the optimal antiplatelet therapy and prevent serious and life-threatening outcomes. Risk stratification has traditionally included clinical and demographic characteristics and has expanded to incorporate angiographic features and laboratory findings. The availability of bedside platelet function testing as well as rapid genotyping assays has also allowed for a more individualized selection of antiplatelet therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and future trends in personalised antiplatelet therapy for patients with CAD, with emphasis on those presenting with an acute coronary syndrome and undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization. The aim is to provide clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of personalised antiplatelet therapy and facilitate informed clinical decision-making.

### Effect of β-blocker therapy on mortality rates and future myocardial infarction rates in patients with coronary artery disease but no history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure [^113nMyuM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to benefit patients who have coronary artery disease and present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and/or congestive heart failure (HF). However, whether beta-blocker therapy provides a similar benefit in patients who have coronary artery disease but not AMI or HF is unknown. A population of 4,304 patients who did not have HF but did have angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (≥ 1 stenosis of ≥ 70%) without AMI at hospital presentation was evaluated. Baseline demographics, cardiac risk factors, clinical presentation, therapeutic procedures, and discharge medications were recorded. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.0 ± 1.9 years (range 1 month to 6.9 years) for outcomes of all-cause death or AMI. Patients' average age was 65 ± 11 years and 77% were men. Overall, 10% died and 5% had a nonfatal AMI. Discharge beta-blocker prescription was associated with an increased event-free AMI survival rate for all-cause death (no beta blocker 88.3%, beta blocker 94.5%, p < 0.001) and death/AMI (no beta blocker 83.4%, beta blocker 89.2%, p < 0.001) but not non-fatal AMI (no beta blocker 93.6%, beta blocker 94.1%, p = 0.60). After adjustment for 16 covariates, including statin prescription, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescription, and type of baseline therapy, the effect of beta blockers on the combination end point of death/AMI was eliminated. However, the effect of beta blockers on death remained (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.93, p = 0.02). Thus, beta blockers are clearly indicated for most patients who have HF or AMI, and our results suggest that patients who have coronary artery disease without these conditions have approximately the same protective benefit against death. No effect was observed on longitudinal incidence of AMI or the combination of death/nonfatal MI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and hypertension (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

### Benefits of pravastatin on cardiovascular events and mortality in older patients with coronary heart disease are equal to or exceed those seen in younger patients: results from the LIPID trial [^111YJuvd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on death from coronary heart disease in older patients with previous coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels is uncertain.

Objective

To compare the relative and absolute effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease who are 65 years of age or older with those in patients 31 to 64 years of age.

Design

Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

87 centers in Australia and New Zealand.

Patients

3514 patients 65 to 75 years of age, chosen from among 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol level of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L (155 to 271 mg/dL).

Intervention

Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo.

Measurements

Major cardiovascular disease events over 6 years.

Results

Older patients were at greater risk than younger patients (31 to 64 years of age) for death (20.6% vs. 9.8%), myocardial infarction (11.4% vs. 9.5%), unstable angina (26.7% vs. 23.2%), and stroke (6.7% vs. 3.1%) (all P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced the risk for all cardiovascular disease events, and similar relative effects were observed in older and younger patients. In patients 65 to 75 years of age, pravastatin therapy reduced mortality by 21% (CI, 7% to 32%), death from coronary heart disease by 24% (CI, 7% to 38%), coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 22% (CI, 9% to 34%), myocardial infarction by 26% (CI, 9% to 40%), and stroke by 12% (CI, -15% to 32%). For every 1000 older patients treated over 6 years, pravastatin prevented 45 deaths, 33 myocardial infarctions, 32 unstable angina events, 34 coronary revascularization procedures, 13 strokes, or 133 major cardiovascular events, compared with 22 deaths and 107 major cardiovascular events per 1000 younger patients. Among older patients, the numbers needed to treat were 22 (CI, 17 to 36) to prevent one death from any cause, 35 (CI, 24 to 67) to prevent one death from coronary heart disease, and 21 (CI, 17 to 31) to prevent one coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

In older patients with coronary heart disease and average or moderately elevated cholesterol levels, pravastatin therapy reduced the risk for all major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Since older patients are at greater risk than younger patients for these events, the absolute benefit of treatment is significantly greater in older patients.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^117VTnAL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In 2022, ischemic heart disease, which includes CAD, accounted for the highest global cardiovascular mortality, with an age-standardized rate of 108.8 deaths per 100,000 people, underscoring its public health burden. Characterized by reduced or blocked oxygen flow to the heart, ischemic heart disease is chronic and dynamic in nature. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), arises from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion.CAD and MI incur significant health care costs, projected to surpass US$1 trillion globally by 2030.

Despite significant advancements in MI treatment, several gaps remain, particularly regarding the optimal use and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy following MI in patients with normal versus reduced heart function (ie, those with left ventricular dysfunction). While beta-blocker therapy has been a cornerstone in managing MI due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, prevent arrhythmias, and improve survival rates, its effectiveness for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or without heart failure remains unclear. Recent reviews have reported mixed findings regarding the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, and have unveiled the fact that most of the evidence suggesting its significant CV mortality and morbidity benefits was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the prereperfusion era (Central Illustration). This presents a critical gap, as current clinical guidelines are based on outdated evidence and lack data from comprehensive RCTs and real-world evidence (RWE) that accurately reflect today's diverse patient populations seen in clinical practice. There is a need for up-to-date, broader and more representative studies that provide insights into the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapyin the context of modern revascularization procedures and newer pharmacotherapies that have improved post-MI outcomes.

### Impact of adherence to guideline-directed prevention strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus following acute coronary syndrome: a 3-year cohort study [^115QV5qn]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly when complicated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The presence of both conditions significantly increases the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and worsens clinical outcomes. ACS encompasses a range of conditions, including ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina pectoris (UAP), all of which contribute to the burden of CAD. Effective management of ACS in patients with CAD and DM relies on comprehensive secondary prevention strategies to reduce the risk of recurrent events, rehospitalization, and mortality.

The implementation of guideline‐directed recommendations for secondary prevention has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with ACS. Primary prevention strategies include smoking cessation and maintaining physical activity, while secondary prevention focuses on controlling risk factors such as antiplatelet therapy, statin use, blood pressure regulation, and the use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2i). Notably, statin therapy has also been shown to improve outcomes in patients with stable CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), further emphasizing its critical role in cardiovascular risk reduction. Despite the known benefits of these interventions, adherence to recommended treatment regimens remains suboptimal in real‐world clinical settings.

This study aimed to evaluate adherence to seven guideline‐based secondary prevention recommendations in patients with CAD and DM presenting with ACS. The adherence rates were assessed before and 3 years after the index ACS. In addition, the impact of adherence to these recommendations on rehospitalization and mortality was analyzed, with a focus on identifying demographic and clinical factors associated with these outcomes.

The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency of adherence to primary and secondary prevention strategies, evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with adherence, and identify factors that may influence rehospitalization and mortality in this patient population. We hypothesized that: adherence to ≥ 5 guideline‐directed secondary prevention strategies would be associated with significantly lower rates of all‐cause mortality compared to adherence to ≤ 4 strategies (HR < 0.70); individual adherence to statins, ACEi/ARBs, and SGLT‐2 inhibitors would demonstrate the strongest independent associations with reduced mortality; and the mortality benefit would be most pronounced in patients with both optimal adherence (≥ 5 strategies) and controlled HbA1c (< 7.0%).

### Standardized outcome measurement for patients with coronary artery disease: consensus from the international consortium for health outcomes measurement (ICHOM) [^116HsfzF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease represents the single greatest global disease burden, both in mortality and morbidity. Recent alarming increases in incidence noted in low-income and middle-income countries raise concern for future generations. However, increasing cardiovascular disease burden is not inevitable. High-income nations have invested heavily in addressing this problem. Mortality from cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease (CAD), has dramatically decreased in the past few decades. While public health initiatives aimed at primary prevention have certainly led to some of these gains, advances in treatment for patients with CAD have accounted for a significant portion.

Despite overall improvement in high-income countries, significant variation in outcomes for patients with CAD still exists. Significant differences in 30-day mortality following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been found between the United Kingdom and Sweden. Even among elderly patients admitted for AMI within the United States, a greater than twofold difference in 30-day risk standardized mortality was found, depending on which hospital provided the care. These findings suggest an opportunity to identify the best management practices that lead to optimal outcomes and then to implement them across broad populations, lessening the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Secondary prevention of ischaemic cardiac events [^114MxJoL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in resource-rich countries, and is becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality in resource-poor countries. Secondary prevention in this context is long-term treatment to prevent recurrent cardiac morbidity and mortality in people who have had either a prior acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome, or who are at high risk due to severe coronary artery stenoses or prior coronary surgical procedures. Secondary prevention in people with an acute MI or acute coronary syndrome within the past 6 months is not included.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antithrombotic treatment; other drug treatments; cholesterol reduction; blood pressure reduction; non-drug treatments; and revascularisation procedures? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 137 systematic reviews or RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: advice to eat less fat, advice to eat more fibre, advice to increase consumption of fish oils, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers plus ACE inhibitors, antioxidant vitamin combinations, antiplatelet agents, aspirin, beta-blockers, beta-carotene, blood pressure reduction, calcium channel blockers, cardiac rehabilitation including exercise, class I antiarrhythmic agents, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), fibrates, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Mediterranean diet, multivitamins, non-specific cholesterol reduction, oral anticoagulants, oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), psychosocial treatment, smoking cessation, statins, vitamin C, and vitamin E.

### Cardiac mortality in patients randomised to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XCgRU]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The present large-scale analysis of randomised trials shows a significant and consistent reduction of cardiac mortality in favour of elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone in stable coronary artery disease patients, the magnitude of which is directly associated with duration of follow-up and a lower risk of spontaneous MI. Lower cardiac mortality with revascularisation plus medical therapy was confirmed in all sensitivity analyses performed. The findings have direct implications for elective cardiac catheterisation procedures in stable patients with documented coronary artery disease. Recommendations for medical therapy alone based on trials with limited follow-up have likely underestimated the benefits of revascularisation plus medical therapy.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to lipid-lowering therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving a 30–49% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy in stable coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114LuYPZ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The role of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the management of stable coronary artery disease remains controversial. Given advancements in medical therapies and stent technology over the last decade, we sought to evaluate whether PCI, when added to medical therapy, improves outcomes when compared with medical therapy alone.

Methods and Results

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, until January 2012, for randomized clinical trials comparing revascularization with PCI to optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, subsequent revascularization, and freedom from angina. Primary analyses were based on longest available follow-up with secondary analyses stratified by trial duration, with short-term (≤ 1 year), intermediate (1–5 years), and long-term (≥ 5 years) time points. We identified 12 randomized clinical trials enrolling 7182 participants who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. For the primary analyses, when compared with OMT, PCI was associated with no significant improvement in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.01), cardiac death (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.06), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70–1.24), or repeat revascularization (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76–1.14), with consistent results over all follow-up time points. Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies in which there was > 50% stent use showed attenuation in the effect size for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78–1.11) with PCI. However, for freedom from angina, there was a significant improved outcome with PCI, as compared with the OMT group (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06–1.37), evident at all of the follow-up time points.

Conclusions

In this most rigorous and comprehensive analysis in patients with stable coronary artery disease, PCI, as compared with OMT, did not reduce the risk of mortality, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization. PCI, however, provided a greater angina relief compared with OMT alone, larger studies with sufficient power are required to prove this conclusively.

### State of the art: evaluation and medical management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1149ELNQ]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

MINOCA treatment — There are no completed RCTs evaluating the role of medical therapies to treat patients with MINOCA; management is largely empirical and consists of cardioprotective medications based on data extrapolated from patients with MI and obstructive CAD as well as etiologic-based therapies. Aspirin and statins are reasonable therapies for all patients with MINOCA who have any evidence of atherosclerotic plaque on coronary angiography or CCTA, and β-adrenergic blocking agents and ACEi or ARBs are indicated for patients with post-MI left ventricular dysfunction. Observationally, the largest retrospective analysis of 9466 patients with MINOCA demonstrated a lower mortality rate at a mean follow-up of 4.1 years with statins or β-blockers and a lower rate of a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for MI, ischemic stroke, and HF with ACEi/ARB or statins.

### In-hospital initiation of statin therapy in acute coronary syndromes: maximizing the early and long-term benefits [^1122Dfhp]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for recurrent coronary events, sudden death, and all-cause mortality. Conventional revascularization therapies reduce the risk of further ischemia but do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic disease. Statins have a proven record in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, statins have been shown to exert varying degrees of pleiotropic effects, which may stabilize vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. A compelling body of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that high-dose, potent statin therapy initiated immediately after an acute coronary event can significantly reduce early as well as longer-term morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, high-dose, potent statin therapy displays a reasonable safety profile. National guidelines now recommend that in patients with ACS, statin therapy should be initiated in hospital prior to discharge, irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, to improve clinical outcomes. Every effort should be made to ensure all eligible patients with ACS are initiated and maintained on statin therapy.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^112jKQVu]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) combining aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor has been consistently shown to reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with aspirin monotherapy, but at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of CAD remains uncertain, owing to the conflicting results of several large randomised trials. Among patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), shorter durations of DAPT (3–6 months) were shown non-inferior to 12 or 24 months duration with respect to MACE, but reduced the rates of major bleeding. Contrariwise, prolonged DAPT durations (18–48 months) reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, but at a cost of an increased risk of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Until more evidence becomes available, the choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. Future studies are however needed to identify patients who may derive benefit from shortened or extended DAPT courses for secondary prevention of CAD based on their individual ischaemic and bleeding risk. Based on limited evidence, 12 months duration of DAPT is currently recommended in patients with ACS irrespective of their management strategy, but large ongoing randomised trials are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3–6 months) for patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES. Finally, several ongoing, large-scale, randomised trials are challenging the current concept of DAPT by investigating P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors as single antiplatelet therapy and may potentially shift the paradigm of antiplatelet therapy after PCI in the near future. This article provides a contemporary state-of-the-art review of the current evidence on DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD and its future perspectives.

### Lipid-lowering trials are not representative of patients managed in clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis of exclusion criteria [^1164rqvi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high, causing 8.9 million deaths worldwide by 2019,≈45% of all deaths in Europe and 16% globally. Primary and secondary CVD prevention measures, such as lifestyle changes or treatment with lipid‐lowering medication, can reduce CVD mortality. Guidelines widely recommend statins as secondary prevention. However, their benefits and harms are less clear for primary prevention, because the net benefit of statins on absolute risk reduction depends on the individual's baseline risk of CVD, and their use is more controversial.

Evidence of the effects of statins on CVD risk might have been drawn from trials with selected patient groups that do not represent real‐world demographics, as previously observed in RCTs in other research fields. Compared with community populations, RCTs less often represent patients with multimorbidity or older age, and these patient groups are often excluded from RCTs. Likewise, people with specific concomitant chronic diseases are commonly excluded. In addition, 1 study found that trials conducted between 2005 and 2015 investigating heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease, or acute coronary syndrome underrepresented women and found that sex‐related differences may have a relevant impact on drug efficacy and safety. Exclusion of specific groups might explain possible differences between observed rates of adverse effects in clinical practice compared with RCTs but might also explain possible different outcomes in certain populations.

Limited data suggest that some groups of patients might have been excluded in early statin trials. Moreover, there is little evidence on the efficacy of statin treatment in the multimorbid, elderly population or those with polypharmacy. It is therefore crucial to investigate which patients were included in recent large lipid‐lowering RCTs. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and a meta‐analysis to assess the prevalence of different patient groups in these trials.

### Randomised trials of secondary prevention programmes in coronary heart disease: systematic review [^115QbQr4]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether multidisciplinary disease management programmes for patients with coronary heart disease improve processes of care and reduce morbidity and mortality.

Data Sources

Randomised clinical trials of disease management programmes in patients with coronary heart disease were identified by searching Medline 1966–2000, Embase 1980–99, CINAHL 1982–99, SIGLE 1980–99, the Cochrane controlled trial register, the Cochrane effective practice and organisation of care study register, and bibliographies of published studies.

Data Extraction

Studies were selected and data were extracted independently by two investigators, and summary risk ratios were calculated by using both the random effects model and the fixed effects model.

Data Synthesis

A total of 12 trials (9803 patients with coronary heart disease) were identified. Disease management programmes had positive impacts on processes of care. Patients randomised to these programmes were more likely to be prescribed efficacious drugs (risk ratio 2.14 (95% confidence interval 1.92 to 2.38) for lipid lowering drugs, 1.19 (1.07 to 1.32) for beta blockers, and 1.07 (1.03 to 1.11) for antiplatelet agents). Five out of seven trials evaluating risk factor profiles showed significantly greater improvements with these programmes in comparison with usual care (with effect sizes in the moderate range). Summary risk ratios were 0.91 (0.79 to 1.04) for all cause mortality, 0.94 (0.80 to 1.10) for recurrent myocardial infarction, and 0.84 (0.76 to 0.94) for admission to hospital. Five of the eight trials evaluating quality of life or functional status reported better outcomes in the intervention arms. Only three of these trials reported the costs of the intervention-the interventions were cost saving in two cases.

Conclusions

Disease management programmes improve processes of care, reduce admissions to hospital, and enhance quality of life or functional status in patients with coronary heart disease. The programmes' impact on survival and recurrent infarctions, their cost effectiveness, and the optimal mix of components remain uncertain.

### Effect of statin therapy on mortality in older adults hospitalized with coronary artery disease: a propensity-adjusted analysis [^114crG66]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effect of statins on long-term mortality in older adults hospitalized with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Participants

Individuals aged 80 and older (mean aged 85.2, 56% female) hospitalized from January 2006 to December 2010 with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina pectoris, or chronic CAD and discharged alive (N = 1,262). Participants were divided into those who did (n = 913) and did not (n = 349) receive a discharge prescription for a statin.

Measurements

All-cause mortality over a median follow-up of 3.1 years.

Results

Participants treated with statins were more likely to be male, to have a primary diagnosis of AMI, to have traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and to receive other standard cardiovascular medications in addition to statins. In unadjusted analysis, statin therapy was associated with lower mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71–0.96). After adjustment for baseline differences between groups and propensity for receiving statin therapy, the effect of statins on mortality was no longer significant (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.74–1.05). The association between statins and mortality was similar in participants aged 80 to 84 and those aged 85 and older.

Conclusion

In this cohort of older adults hospitalized with CAD, statin therapy had no significant effect on long-term survival after adjustment for between-group differences. These findings, although preliminary, call into question the benefit of statin therapy for secondary prevention in a real-world population of adults aged 80 and older and underscore the need for shared decision-making when prescribing statins in this age group.

### Cardiac mortality in patients randomised to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wusVi]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

The value of elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone in managing stable patients with coronary artery disease is debated. We reviewed all trials comparing the two strategies in this population.

Methods and results

From inception through November 2020, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and other databases were searched for randomised trials comparing revascularisation against medical therapy alone in clinically stable coronary artery disease patients. Treatment effects were measured by rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals, using random-effects models. Cardiac mortality was the pre-specified primary endpoint. Spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and its association with cardiac mortality were secondary endpoints. Further endpoints included all-cause mortality, any MI, and stroke. Longest follow-up data were abstracted. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021225598). Twenty-five trials involving 19 806 patients (10 023 randomised to revascularisation plus medical therapy and 9783 to medical therapy alone) were included. Compared with medical therapy alone, revascularisation yielded a lower risk of cardiac death [RR 0.79 (0.67–0.93), P < 0.01] and spontaneous MI [RR 0.74 (0.64–0.86), P < 0.01]. By meta-regression, the cardiac death risk reduction after revascularisation, compared with medical therapy alone, was linearly associated with follow-up duration [RR per 4-year follow-up: 0.81 (0.69–0.96), P = 0.008], spontaneous MI absolute difference (P = 0.01) and percentage of multivessel disease at baseline (P = 0.004). Trial sequential and sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of the cardiac mortality findings. All-cause mortality [0.94 (0.87–1.01), P = 0.11], any MI (P = 0.14), and stroke risk (P = 0.30) did not differ significantly between strategies.

Conclusion

In stable coronary artery disease patients, randomisation to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy led to reduced cardiac mortality compared with medical therapy alone. The cardiac survival benefit after revascularisation improved with longer follow-up times and was associated with fewer spontaneous MIs.

### Stabilizing stable coronary artery disease: No beta-blocker, No problem? [^1156jpny]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Shortly after joining Imperial Chemical Industries in 1958, Sir James Black developed propranolol in response to the sudden death of his father from a myocardial infarction (MI). Even after a Nobel Prize in 1988, few could have imagined the breadth of impact his discovery would have. Beta-blockers (BB) are now among the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States, with approximately one-tenth of patients in the United States receiving a BB in 2020for a broad spectrum of indications, including hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, essential tremor, migraine, anxiety, portal hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Stable CAD represents a highly heterogenous population that can be broadly subdivided into 3 subgroups based on current literature: 1) patients without a history of MI; 2) patients with a history of remote MI (≥ 1 year) without resultant complication, such as reduced ejection fraction (EF), heart failure, or recurrent MI; and 3) patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization. Evidence supporting BB use on stable CAD was largely extrapolated from studies on patients with MI, where their benefits were primarily established in the prereperfusion era. With the implementation of timely reperfusion therapy, potent antiplatelet agents, and statins, the role of BB inpatients with uncomplicated CAD has been challenged. Recent large well-conducted randomized trials have underscored this uncertainty, indicating no meaningful benefits of BB therapy for mortality or recurrent MI in patients post-MI with preserved EF. However, no large placebo-controlled trials have yet investigated contemporary BB use in patients with stable CAD. Thus, whether BB provide clinical benefits on mortality or cardiovascular (CV) outcomes beyond antianginal effects in this population remains unclear.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^1117QY4d]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1.2 Secondary prevention and established CAD

The treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is well established and well defined by consensus guidelines. 3, 9 Despite limited enrollment in clinical trials, older adults derive mortality benefits from guideline‐recommended medications for secondary prevention after ACS; however, the benefits must be balanced with an increased risk of adverse side effects and DDIs.

Antiplatelet Therapy: Aspirin (ASA) and P2Y12 Antagonist (eg, clopidogrel, ticagrelor): Aspirin therapy has a class I recommendation as a life‐long therapy after ACS as it decreases mortality and recurrence of cardiovascular events. 3, 9 In the context of ACS, guidelines also recommend 12 months of dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor, regardless of treatment modality (medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft). However, DAPT is associated with increased bleeding risk, especially in older adults. To mitigate this risk aspirin doses should not exceed 100 mg per day. Furthermore, consider stopping the P2Y12 antagonist earlier in patients with an elevated bleeding risk. Of note, prasugrel is not recommended in patients over 75.

Triple therapy in patients requiring long‐term oral anticoagulation should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Recent trials have shown that aspirin may be safely omitted while continuing dual therapy with an anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor antagonist. 25, 26 Aspirin may be resumed once the P2Y12 inhibitor is stopped, although recent data show that rivaroxaban monotherapy is safe and adequate in patients with stable CAD and atrial fibrillation. 31 Monitor patients closely in the first 90 days after P2Y12 discontinuation for recurrent ischemic events. 32

Statins: High‐intensity statin therapy (goal LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL) is recommended after ACS for pleiotropic effects, 3, 9, 18, 19 but older adults have a greater risk of statin‐associated muscle symptoms and moderate‐intensity statin therapy may be preferred. 18, 19 In order to reduce the incidence of adverse effects, the dose of simvastatin in particular should not exceed 40 mg daily. 33 In the very old (> 90 years old) with no recent ACS, statin therapy may be discontinued following a risk‐benefit discussion with the patient, noting that statin‐derived benefits are seen after 4 to 5 years of therapy. 18, 19

The present study showed no significant effect of vitamin K2 and D supplementation on CAC progression in a population with a high AVC and CAC score yet no known ischemic heart disease. In a subanalysis, high-risk patients with CAC ≥ 400 AU had a significantly lower progression of CAC. This study presents novel, interesting, and hypothesis-generating findings that need to be further investigated in future studies.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Extent and progression of CAC are strong predictors of MI and mortality.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Current treatment modalities of coronary artery disease include lifestyle change, blood pressure control, and lipid-lowering medication. No medication or nutritional supplementation has been shown to reduce progression of CAC in a randomized setting.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Vitamin K2 and D supplementation may have an interesting and beneficial effect on coronary artery disease; however, additional hypothesis-testing studies are required. If this vitamin supplementation can reduce calcified and noncalcified plaque progression, it may be a new player in the future of prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular systolic function: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112fGAWG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in patients with coronary heart disease and preserved left ventricular (LV) function.

Background

The ACEIs have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction (MI). However, there is conflicting evidence concerning the benefits of ACEIs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved LV systolic function.

Methods

An extensive search was performed to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACEI use in patients with CAD and preserved LV systolic function. Of 61 potentially relevant articles screened, 6 trials met the inclusion criteria. They were reviewed to determine cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, all-cause mortality, and revascularization rates. We performed random-effect model meta-analyses and quantified between-studies heterogeneity with I(2).

Results

There were 16,772 patients randomized to ACEI and 16,728 patients randomized to placebo. Use of ACEIs was associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.96, p = 0.01), nonfatal MI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, p = 0.003), all-cause mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, p = 0.0003), and revascularization rates (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00, p = 0.04). There was no significant between-studies heterogeneity. Treatment of 100 patients for an average duration of 4.4 years prevents either of the adverse outcomes (one death, or one nonfatal myocardial infarction, or one cardiovascular death or one coronary revascularization procedure).

Conclusions

The cumulative evidence provided by this meta-analysis shows a modest favorable effect of ACEIs on the outcome of patients with CAD and preserved LV systolic function.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^111wE4gP]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Stable CAD

Aspirin remains the cornerstone for secondary prevention of patients with stable CAD, irrespective of the management strategy. In a large meta-analysis including 16 secondary prevention trials and 17 000 high-risk patients, low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE (cardiovascular (CV) death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)) (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88), a 31% relative risk reduction in MI (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and a 22% relative risk reduction in ischaemic stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), at the expense of an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90) and major extracranial bleeding (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.76). Aspirin marginally reduced CV mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, p = 0.06), resulting in a 10% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, p = 0.02). At variance of the antiplatelet effects, the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin increase at higher doses. The optimal risk:benefit ratio appears to be achieved with an aspirin dosage of 75–150 mg daily.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^1123Hsa5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The role of statins in primary prevention seems to also be well established. The CTT meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials (90,056 individuals) showed that statins can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularization and stroke by about 12% per 1 mmol/l reduction in LDL-C, irrespective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting characteristics. The observed reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, P < 0.0001) reflected a 19% reduction in coronary mortality (0.81, P < 0.0001), with significant corresponding reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0.77, P < 0.0001), in the need for coronary revascularization (0.76, P < 0.0001), in fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.83, P < 0.0001), and, combining these, of 21% in any such major vascular event (0.79, P < 0.0001). Taking all years together, the overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/l LDL-C reduction translated into 48 fewer participants having major vascular events per 1,000 among those with pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD) at baseline, compared with 25 per 1,000 among participants with no such history.

### Cardiac mortality in patients randomised to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155K75f]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

The value of elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone in managing stable patients with coronary artery disease is debated. We reviewed all trials comparing the two strategies in this population.

Methods and Results

From inception through November 2020, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and other databases were searched for randomised trials comparing revascularisation against medical therapy alone in clinically stable coronary artery disease patients. Treatment effects were measured by rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals, using random-effects models. Cardiac mortality was the pre-specified primary endpoint. Spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and its association with cardiac mortality were secondary endpoints. Further endpoints included all-cause mortality, any MI, and stroke. Longest follow-up data were abstracted. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021225598). Twenty-five trials involving 19 806 patients (10 023 randomised to revascularisation plus medical therapy and 9783 to medical therapy alone) were included. Compared with medical therapy alone, revascularisation yielded a lower risk of cardiac death [RR 0.79 (0.67–0.93), P < 0.01] and spontaneous MI [RR 0.74 (0.64–0.86), P < 0.01]. By meta-regression, the cardiac death risk reduction after revascularisation, compared with medical therapy alone, was linearly associated with follow-up duration [RR per 4-year follow-up: 0.81 (0.69–0.96), P = 0.008], spontaneous MI absolute difference (P = 0.01) and percentage of multivessel disease at baseline (P = 0.004). Trial sequential and sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of the cardiac mortality findings. All-cause mortality [0.94 (0.87–1.01), P = 0.11], any MI (P = 0.14), and stroke risk (P = 0.30) did not differ significantly between strategies.

Conclusion

In stable coronary artery disease patients, randomisation to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy led to reduced cardiac mortality compared with medical therapy alone. The cardiac survival benefit after revascularisation improved with longer follow-up times and was associated with fewer spontaneous MIs.

### Statins for acute coronary syndrome [^113GV8UK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The early period following the onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a critical stage of coronary heart disease, with a high risk of recurrent events and deaths. The short-term effects of early treatment with statins on patient-relevant outcomes in patients suffering from ACS are unclear. This is an update of a review previously published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of early administered statins in patients with ACS, in terms of mortality and cardiovascular events.

Search Methods

We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to April Week 1 2013), EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2013 Week 14), and CINAHL (EBSCO) (1938 to 2013) on 12 April 2013. We applied no language restrictions. We supplemented the search by contacting experts in the field, by reviewing the reference lists of reviews and editorials on the topic, and by searching trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statins with placebo or usual care, with initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following the onset of ACS, follow-up of at least 30 days, and reporting at least one clinical outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for all outcomes in the treatment and control groups and pooled data using random-effects models.

Main Results

Eighteen studies (14,303 patients) compared early statin treatment versus placebo or no treatment in patients with ACS. The new search did not identify any new studies for inclusion. There were some concerns about risk of bias and imprecision of summary estimates. Based on moderate quality evidence, early statin therapy did not decrease the combined primary outcome of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke at one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08) or four months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) of follow-up when compared to placebo or no treatment. There were no statistically significant risk reductions from statins for total death, total myocardial infarction, total stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization procedures, and acute heart failure at one month or at four months, although there were favorable trends related to statin use for each of these endpoints. Moderate quality evidence suggests that the incidence of unstable angina was significantly reduced at four months following ACS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96). There were nine individuals with myopathy (elevated creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal) in statin-treated patients (0.13%) versus one (0.015%) in the control groups. Serious muscle toxicity was mostly limited to patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate quality evidence, due to concerns about risk of bias and imprecision, initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following ACS does not reduce death, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to four months, but reduces the occurrence of unstable angina at four months following ACS. Serious side effects were rare.

### Effect of beta blockers after coronary artery bypass in postinfarct patients: what can we learn from available literature? [^117QZpsu]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that beta adrenergic antagonist therapy benefits patients with coronary disease through reduced mortality rate after acute myocardial infarction and reduced incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. The long-term benefit of this therapy in survivors of myocardial infarction who are subsequently revascularized, however, has not been defined or studied rigorously. We reviewed the published data to clarify the role of beta blockade in patients who had surgical revascularization after myocardial infarction. We found that patients who received beta blockers after myocardial infarction had a reduced mortality rate and fewer cardiac events in most clinical situations, a benefit which likely extends to patients who have had subsequent surgical revascularization.

### The 2021 AHA / ACC / SCAI coronary artery revascularization recommendations: need for emphasis on prevention and future considerations [^115abpC6]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Medical therapy reduces events for most patients with CAD

The results from the ISCHEMIA (the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) and COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trials clearly demonstrated that a strategy of routine revascularization in patients with stable CAD provided no incremental benefit in reducing cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction when added to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), which included robust pharmacologic secondary prevention combined with intensive lifestyle intervention during long-term follow-up. This was true even in the presence of substantial baseline ischemia, with the notable exception of patients with impaired systolic function or left main coronary artery disease who were not included in the trials,(see Table 1).

Table 1
Optimal Preventive Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Established CAD Being Considered for Coronary Revascularization

In a multicenter registry of patients who underwent coronary artery revascularization outside the context of randomized controlled trials, adherence to GDMT was a more powerful predictor of freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events than whether revascularization was done surgically or percutaneously. Considering that the ultimate goal of revascularization guidelines is to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in potential candidates for coronary revascularization, the absence of specific recommendations or therapeutic guidance in the 2021 AHA/ACC/SCAI Coronary Revascularization Guideline on how to optimize preventive pharmacotherapies beyond antiplatelet agents represents an important opportunity for future discussions on the additive value and clinical benefits of secondary prevention when added to revascularization.

### Adherence to coronary artery disease secondary prevention medicines: exploring modifiable barriers [^116jAkYa]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are typically prescribed secondary prevention medicines (SPMs), such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, statins, oral antiplatelet agents and/or aspirin. The benefits of SPMs are well established, and their use is recommended in national and international guidelines.

However, non-adherence to medicines — including SPMs — remains a key challenge, limiting overall benefits and often leading to poor health outcomes, lower quality of life and increased demand for healthcare. A number of studies have reported high levels of non-adherence among patients with CAD, typically in the range of 33%–50%. Non-adherence to SPMs has been associated with a 10%–40% relative increase in the risk of cardiac hospitalisation and a 50%–80% relative increase in mortality.

A number of factors need to be considered if we are to remedy this complex problem in clinical practice.

First, the medicines-taking experience of patients should be routinely explored and modifiable barriers addressed. Non-adherence is often a hidden problem, under-recognised by prescribers and not necessarily disclosed by patients. Healthcare professionals should assess, elicit and explore patients' beliefs and experiences with their medicines to help them make informed choices and address any barriers. This requires the use of specific tools that can be deployed in clinical practice to explore and address barriers to medicines taking.

Second, patient self-reports may be the most useful tools for exploring adherence in clinical practice because they are inexpensive, pragmatic and more likely than other tools to reveal barriers. Social desirability and memory biases may lead to over-reporting of adherence, but self-reported non-adherence behaviour is broadly considered to be reliable and accurate.

### Β-blockers, calcium antagonists, and mortality in stable coronary artery disease: an international cohort study [^112GFVEo]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large international study of contemporary stable CAD with a high rate use of evidence-based secondary prevention therapies, β-blocker use at baseline was associated with lower 5-year all-cause mortality only in patients enrolled in the year following MI.

Results were consistent when considering change of β-blocker use before an event and doses of β-blockers. The use of calcium antagonists was not associated with any differences in outcome. β-blocker use appeared associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in patients with no history of PCI.

No RCT has shown a benefit of β-blockers compared with placebo on hard clinical outcomes in stable CAD without LV systolic dysfunction. Evidence of these agents improving outcome is derived from old trials in acute MI, mostly performed before the advent of secondary prevention and reperfusion therapies; the benefit of β-blockers was mainly driven by their use in the acute phase of MI.

Observational studies and post hoc RCT analyses have questioned the benefit from β-blockers on mortality, notwithstanding limitations in these studies relating to sample size, geographical scope, or selected patient profile. FAST-MIfound no association between β-blocker cessation 1 year after MI and all-cause mortality. A French reimbursement database studyshowed no impact on mortality of stopping β-blockers beyond 1 year after MI without heart failure. The Kaiser Permanente studyshowed evidence of lower risk of death with β-blocker use in patients enrolled in the acute phase after MI. The REACHregistry found no association between β-blocker use and mortality in stable CAD outpatients but suggested benefit in patients with recent prior MI (< 1 year); however, LV function and β-blocker type or dose were unknown. The present results are consistent with a post hoc analysis of the CHARISMA trialshowing no association between β-blocker use and lower mortality in a selected trial population of stable patients with or without prior MI. However, outcomes may differ between the selected patient populations enrolled in clinical trials and patients enrolled using similar criteria in population based observational studies.

### Endothelin-1 is associated with mortality that can be attenuated with high intensity statin therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^116LdZ2k]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

All coronary artery disease (CAD) patients do not benefit equally of secondary prevention. Individualized intensity of drug therapy is currently implemented in guidelines for CAD and diabetes. Novel biomarkers are needed to identify patient subgroups potentially benefitting from individual therapy. This study aimed to investigate endothelin-1 (ET-1) as a biomarker for increased risk of adverse events and to evaluate if medication could alleviate the risks in patients with high ET-1.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort study ARTEMIS included 1946 patients with angiographically documented CAD. Blood samples and baseline data were collected at enrollment and the patients were followed for 11 years. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the association between circulating ET-1 level and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death, non-CV death and sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Results

Here we show an association of circulating ET-1 level with higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR: 2.06; 95% CI 1.5–2.83), CV death, non-CV death and SCD in patients with CAD. Importantly, high intensity statin therapy reduces the risk for all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 0.05; 95% CI 0.01–0.38) and CV death (adjusted HR: 0.06; 95% CI 0.01–0.44) in patients with high ET-1, but not in patients with low ET-1. High intensity statin therapy does not associate with reduction of risk for non-CV death or SCD.

Conclusions

Our data suggests a prognostic value for high circulating ET-1 in patients with stable CAD. High intensity statin therapy associates with reduction of risk for all-cause mortality and CV death in CAD patients with high ET-1.

### Potential reductions in United States coronary heart disease mortality by treating more patients [^112KNgcA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately one half of the recent decline observed in age-adjusted coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates can be attributed to the use of modern medical and surgical interventions. In 2000, however, only about 30% to 60% of eligible patients actually received the appropriate treatment. To examine the reduction in CHD mortality potentially achievable by increasing the provision of specific medical and surgical treatment to eligible patients with CHD in the United States, we integrated the data on CHD patient numbers, medical and surgical treatment uptake levels, and treatment effectiveness using a previously validated CHD policy model. We estimated the number of deaths prevented or postponed for 2000 (baseline) and for an alternative scenario (60% of eligible patients). In 2000, the treatment levels in the United States were generally poor; only 30% to 60% of eligible patients received the appropriate therapy. These treatments resulted in approximately 159,330 fewer deaths. By treating 60% of eligible patients, 297,470 fewer deaths would have been obtained (minimum 118,360; maximum 628,120), representing 134,635 less than in 2000, with approximately 32% from heart failure therapy, 30% from secondary prevention therapy, 19% from acute coronary syndrome treatment, 15% from primary prevention with statins, 0.5% from hypertension treatment, and 1% from coronary bypass surgery for chronic angina. These findings remained stable in the sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, increasing the proportion of eligible patients with CHD who received the appropriate treatment could have achieved approximately 135,000 fewer deaths in 2000, almost doubling the benefit actually achieved. Future strategies should maximize the delivery of appropriate therapies to all eligible patients with CHD and prioritize medical therapies for secondary prevention and heart failure.

### Statins in familial hypercholesterolemia: consequences for coronary artery disease and all-cause Mortality [^112Ajevg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A statin-induced reduction of coronary artery disease (CAD) events and mortality has not been adequately quantified in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

Objectives

This study estimated the relative risk reduction for CAD and mortality by statins in heterozygous FH patients.

Methods

The authors included all adult heterozygous FH patients, identified by the Dutch screening program for FH between 1994 and 2013, who were free of CAD at baseline. Hospital, pharmacy, and mortality records between 1995 and 2015 were linked to these patients. The primary outcome was the composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and death from any cause. The effect of statins (time-varying) was determined using a Cox proportional hazard model, while correcting for the use of other lipid-lowering therapy, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors, and antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication. The authors applied inverse-probability-for-treatment weighting (IPTW) to account for differences at baseline between statin users and never-users.

Results

The authors obtained medical records of 2,447 patients, of whom 888 were excluded on the basis of age < 18 years or previous CAD. Simvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg accounted for 23.1% and 22.8% of all prescriptions, respectively. Statin users (n = 1,041) experienced 89 CAD events and 17 deaths during 11,674 person-years of follow-up versus statin never-users (n = 518), who had 22 CAD events and 9 deaths during 4,892 person-years (combined rates 8.8 vs. 5.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; p < 0.001). After applying IPTW and adjusting for other medications, the hazard ratio of statin use for CAD and all-cause mortality was 0.56 (95% confidence interval: 0.33 to 0.96).

Conclusions

In patients with heterozygous FH, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy lowered the risk for CAD and mortality by 44%. This is essential information in all cost-effectiveness studies of this disorder, such as when evaluating reimbursement of new lipid-lowering therapies.

1.4.2 Revascularization approach

While historical studies implied that surgical revascularization could improve survival rates for patients with CCD, recent studies and comprehensive reviews have largely found no substantial impact of such procedures on reducing all‐cause mortality in CCD patients. A meta‐analysis of randomized trials showed an annualized mortality rate in the medical therapy arm, ACME‐2 (Angioplasty Compared to Medicine: Two‐Vessel Disease) has reported 4.0%, while 1.0% in medical therapy arm of later studies like FAME‐2 (Fractional Flow Reserve Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Plus Optimal Medical Treatment [OMT] vs. OMT), signifying progress in medical management.

The 2023 CCD Guideline, similar to the previous 2021 Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization, emphasizes the importance of informed decisions regarding revascularization. There should be a comprehensive, team‐based approach, the guidelines advocate for the involvement of a Heart Team, including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and other cardiovascular specialists to improve patient outcomes. This team plays a fundamental role in devising revascularization strategies that are tailored to individual patient profiles, especially those with complex coronary or multivessel diseases and other significant comorbidities.

The principle of patient‐centered care is also emphasized. Treatment decisions should reflect the best clinical evidence and align with patients' values, preferences, and goals, reinforcing the practice of shared decision‐making. The 2023 CCD Guideline recommends that for patients with persistent angina that limits their lifestyle despite optimal medical therapy with a disease burden that is amenable to revascularization, revascularization should be an attempt to alleviate symptoms.

1.5 Beta blockers

Prior guidelines have advocated for extended duration of beta‐blocker therapy, especially post‐MI or ACS and continued for 3 years and in CCD. However, a major shift in the guidelines now recommends re‐evaluating the indication for beta‐blockers 1 year after a myocardial event, given the mixed evidence on their long‐term efficacy, possibility of side effects like fatigue and depression, along with possible drug interactions (COR2b). Ongoing beta‐blocker therapy is now specifically indicated only for patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 50%), presenting with angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, or who have experienced spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Beta‐blockers are generally not recommended for CCD patients receiving elective PCI, those without prior MI, or those with LVEF above 50%.

### Impact of adherence to guideline-directed prevention strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus following acute coronary syndrome: a 3-year cohort study [^111wLzLy]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Comparison of rehospitalization and total mortality across recommendation implementation score groups over 3 years.

The results of this study demonstrate significant associations between adherence to guideline‐based secondary prevention strategies and improved clinical outcomes, including reduced rehospitalization and mortality rates. However, it is important to note that this is an observational study, and despite statistical adjustments for potential confounders, residual confounding may still influence the observed associations. As such, the findings should not be interpreted as establishing causality. The relationships identified between adherence and outcomes highlight the potential benefits of guideline‐directed therapies but underscore the need for further research, including randomized controlled trials, to confirm these findings and establish causal relationships.

### The 2021 AHA / ACC / SCAI coronary artery revascularization recommendations: need for emphasis on prevention and future considerations [^111S55LF]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

For nearly 4 decades, controversy persists about the management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons regarding the optimal approach to myocardial revascularization, as both catheter-based and surgical techniques have continued to evolve. Likewise, in recent years, there also have been profound developments of increasingly more effective secondary prevention strategies directed at multiple therapeutic targets of residual cardiovascular risk including serum lipids, blood pressure, platelet function, and vascular inflammation which, in the aggregate, provide a robust medical therapy platform for enhancing improved outcomes.

Against this backdrop, the recent publication of the 2021 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularizationaffords us important new therapeutic insights and treatment recommendations. We commend the guideline committee for their formidable accomplishment that provides clinicians with increased clarity and guidance for when, and in whom, surgical or percutaneous revascularization should be strongly considered (Class I and IIa) or withheld (Class III) or when these procedures are of uncertain benefit (Class IIb). However, we believe it is time for the academic and practicing cardiology community to place a greater focus on how multifaceted, preventive pharmacotherapy has become an indispensable component of modern-day care for patients with established CAD to improve clinical outcomes.

### Impact of combination evidence-based medical therapy on mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^1118Djij]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Several individual pharmacological agents, such as antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents, have proven efficacy in reducing mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, the impact of the combination of these agents on clinical outcomes has not been studied before.

Methods and Results

A total of 1358 consecutive patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes between January 1999 and March 2002 were identified, and data on baseline demographics, comorbidities, and in-hospital management were collected. On the basis of discharge use of evidence-based therapies, we created a composite appropriateness score depending on the number of the drugs used divided by the number of the drugs potentially indicated for each patient. The impact of the composite score on 6-month mortality was analyzed using a risk-adjusted logistic regression model. The odds ratio for death for all indicated medications used (appropriateness level IV) versus none of the indicated medications used (appropriateness level 0) was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.42; P < 0.0001); similarly, odds ratio for appropriateness level III versus level 0 was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.75; P = 0.0018), odds ratio for appropriateness level II versus level 0 was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.77; P = 0.01), and odds ratio for appropriateness level I versus level 0 was 0.36 (95% CI, 0.08 to 1.75; P = 0.20).

Conclusions

Use of combination evidence-based medical therapies was independently and strongly associated with lower 6-month mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Such therapies, most of which are generic and inexpensive today, seem to offer a marked survival advantage compared with patients in whom such therapies are omitted.

### Statin therapy is associated with reduced mortality across all age groups of individuals with significant coronary disease, including very elderly patients [^111DuezT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluated the effect of statin therapy on mortality in individuals with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) stratified by age.

Background

Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in individuals with CAD. Unfortunately, the large statin trials excluded individuals over 80 years old, and it is therefore unknown whether very elderly individuals benefit from statins as do younger individuals.

Methods

A cohort of 7,220 individuals with angiographically defined significant CAD (≥ 70%) was included. Statin prescription was determined at hospital discharge. Patients were followed up for 3.3 ± 1.8 years (maximum 6.8). Patients were grouped by age (< 65, 65 to 79, and ≥ 80 years) to determine whether statin therapy reduced mortality in an age-dependent manner.

Results

Average age was 65 ± 12 years; 74% were male; and 31% had a postmyocardial infarction status. Overall mortality was 16%. Elderly patients were significantly less likely to receive statins than younger patients (≥ 80 years: 19.8%; 65 to 79 years: 21.1%; < 65 years: 28.0%; p < 0.001). Mortality was decreased among statin recipients in all age groups: ≥ 80 years: 29.5% among patients not taking a statin versus 8.5% of those taking a statin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, p = 0.036); 65 to 79 years: 18.7% vs. 6.0% (HR 0.56, p < 0.001); and < 65 years: 8.9% vs. 3.1% (HR 0.70, p = 0.097).

Conclusions

Statin therapy is associated with reduced mortality in all age groups of individuals with significant CAD, including very elderly individuals. Although older patients were less likely to receive statin therapy, they received a greater absolute risk reduction than younger individuals. More aggressive statin use after CAD diagnosis may be indicated, even in older patients.

### Bezafibrate for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with coronary artery disease: 20-year mortality follow-up of the BIP randomized control trial [^112L7Utw]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Currently statins are the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases related to atherosclerosis including CAD. Nonetheless, despite the almost universal use of statins in the setting of secondary prevention of CAD, significant residual cardiovascular risk is still present, especially in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic syndrome. The current guidelines recommend considering combination fibrate-statin therapy for patients when statin therapy alone is not adequate to achieve lipid goals. Despite the strong theoretical background, there are only few hard outcomes data regarding combined bezafibrate and statin treatment: one small randomized study and number of observational studies. In these observations bezafibrate/statin treatment was a safe and was associated with a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events compared with statins alone. Beneficial effects of long-term combination therapy with bezafibrate and ezetimibe in patients with dyslipidemia were also reported. Probably, combined bezafibrate/statin or bezafibrate/ezetimibe therapy will be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control and residual cardiovascular risk reduction and theoretically might prevent statin-associated new-onset diabetes.

Study limitations

The present study is limited by the post hoc nature of the analysis of the BIP study. It should also be noted that the significant long-term effects of bezafibrate therapy could be observed only after adjustment for important established prognostic predictors including initiation of statins during the double-blind phase of the BIP trial. We do not have information regarding medications or events after the cessation of the BIP trial beyond all-cause mortality nor can we account for changes in medical practice and management guidelines over the long follow-up period. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the possible long-term mortality benefit of bezafibrate in the current era of universal statin-based secondary prevention in CAD patients.

### Revascularisation versus medical treatment in patients with stable coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis [^114T8uBZ]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

While it is generally accepted that coronary revascularisation reduces the risk of death and myocardial infarction compared with initial medical treatment among patients with acute coronary syndromes, the prognostic benefit is less well established among patients with stable coronary artery disease. Compared with medical treatment, coronary artery bypass grafting has been shown to convey a survival advantage; conversely, the benefit of percutaneous coronary interventions remains debatable. None of the individual trials comparing medical treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention have shown a survival advantage, and meta-analyses revealed conflicting results, with some reporting no differenceand others suggesting a modest benefit. Notwithstanding, none of the randomised trials has been adequately powered to deal with survival, whereas treatment effects were reduced owing to crossover to revascularisation in a sizable proportion of patients and exclusion of high risk patients based on angiographically defined extent of coronary artery disease. Moreover, revascularisation techniques have matured over time. Nowadays, coronary artery bypass grafting systematically employs the internal mammary artery with proved long term patency and survival benefit. Similarly, percutaneous coronary intervention has evolved with important historical transitions from the era of balloon angioplasty, over bare metal stents, to early generation, Food and Drug Administration approved drug eluting stents, followed more recently by new generation drug eluting stents.

A large number of trials compared the different revascularisation strategies, including coronary artery bypass grafting, balloon angioplasty, and percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stentsor with various FDA approved drug eluting stents against medical treatment, as well as different revascularisation strategies head to head.

Network meta-analysis allows a unified analysis of the entire set of available trials by combining all direct within trial comparisons with indirect between trial comparisons of interventions constructed from trials that have one intervention in common, while fully respecting randomisation. We established a collaborative group of investigators consisting of cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and non-invasive cardiologists with expertise in the specialty of revascularisation, and conducted a network meta-analysis of all available trials to provide novel evidence in view of several recently reported trials and major technological advances in revascularisation and medical treatment.

### State of the art: evaluation and medical management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113UqbxE]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Therapies based on imaging and physiologic studies — preventive pharmacotherapy for nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA) notes that despite the absence of definitive trial evidence, there is strong pathophysiologic and observational support for lipid-lowering and other preventive therapies, and lowering LDL-C has consistently demonstrated risk reduction across coronary artery disease; therapies such as statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and β-blockers, have favorable effects, and it is reasonable to individualize preventive regimens for patients with NOCA — particularly those with elevated LDL-C, high-risk plaque features, or additional risk enhancers — while awaiting targeted trial data. The WARRIOR trial randomized women with stable symptoms and NOCA to intensive medical therapy including high-dose statins and ACEI/ARBs or usual medical care; the trial fell short of its 4422-participant goal, many were already on therapy (70% statins, ≥ 50% ACEI/ARBs, 40% β-blockers), and after 5 years ≈16% in both arms reached the primary composite end point with no differences in secondary outcomes or subgroups.

### Perindopril erbumine [^117F4fYA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2 Stable Coronary Artery Disease

The EURopean trial On reduction of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study conducted in 12,218 patients who had evidence of stable coronary artery disease without clinical heart failure. Patients had evidence of coronary artery disease documented by previous myocardial infarction more than 3 months before screening, coronary revascularization more than 6 months before screening, angiographic evidence of stenosis (at least 70% narrowing of one or more major coronary arteries), or positive stress test in men with a history of chest pain. After a run-in period of 4 weeks during which all patients received perindopril 2 mg to 8 mg, the patients were randomly assigned to perindopril 8 mg once daily (n = 6,110) or matching placebo (n = 6,108). The mean follow-up was 4.2 years. The study examined the long-term effects of perindopril on time to first event of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

The mean age of patients was 60 years; 85% were male, 92% were taking platelet inhibitors, 63% were taking β blockers, and 56% were taking lipid-lowering therapy. The EUROPA study showed that perindopril significantly reduced the relative risk for the primary endpoint events (Table 1). This beneficial effect is largely attributable to a reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. This beneficial effect of perindopril on the primary outcome was evident after about one year of treatment (Figure 1). The outcome was similar across all predefined subgroups by age, underlying disease or concomitant medication (Figure 2).

### Impact of adherence to guideline-directed prevention strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus following acute coronary syndrome: a 3-year cohort study [^116sGCcH]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly increase the risk after acute coronary syndrome. This study evaluated adherence to guideline-directed secondary prevention strategies and demonstrated their substantial impact on reducing rehospitalization and mortality in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 987 CAD and DM patients admitted for ACS between 2015 and 2018. Adherence to seven evidence-based secondary prevention strategies was assessed: smoking cessation, physical activity, antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, ACEi/ARB therapy, and SGLT-2i therapy. Patients were categorized into groups based on the number of recommendations followed (0–2, 3–4, and 5+). Primary outcomes included rehospitalization and all-cause mortality over a 3-year follow-up period.

Results

At baseline, only 12.4% of patients adhered to five or more recommendations, which dramatically increased to 71.9% by the 3-year follow-up. Individual adherence to each of blood pressure control (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.94), ACEi/ARB therapy (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67–0.89), and SGLT-2i therapy (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68–0.92) significantly reduced rehospitalization risk. Similarly, adherence to these therapies individually reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67–0.91; HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63–0.87; and HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.61–0.85, respectively). Importantly, a stepwise increase in adherence was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in mortality (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52–0.81, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

This study highlights the critical role of comprehensive, multifactorial secondary prevention in its association with improved long-term outcomes in patients with CAD and DM following ACS.

ABSTRACT

Background

Coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly increase the risk after acute coronary syndrome. This study evaluated adherence to guideline‐directed secondary prevention strategies and demonstrated their substantial impact on reducing rehospitalization and mortality in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 987 CAD and DM patients admitted for ACS between 2015 and 2018. Adherence to seven evidence‐based secondary prevention strategies was assessed: smoking cessation, physical activity, antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, ACEi/ARB therapy, and SGLT‐2i therapy. Patients were categorized into groups based on the number of recommendations followed (0–2, 3–4, and 5+). Primary outcomes included rehospitalization and all‐cause mortality over a 3‐year follow‐up period.

Results

At baseline, only 12.4% of patients adhered to five or more recommendations, which dramatically increased to 71.9% by the 3‐year follow‐up. Individual adherence to each of blood pressure control (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.94), ACEi/ARB therapy (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67–0.89), and SGLT‐2i therapy (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68–0.92) significantly reduced rehospitalization risk. Similarly, adherence to these therapies individually reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67–0.91; HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63–0.87; and HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.61–0.85, respectively). Importantly, a stepwise increase in adherence was associated with a dose‐dependent reduction in mortality (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52–0.81, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

This study highlights the critical role of comprehensive, multifactorial secondary prevention in its association with improved long‐term outcomes in patients with CAD and DM following ACS.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease… [^111Xz1v2]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Several studies have examined optimal LDL levels in patients with CAD. In one trial, patients given intensive therapy with atorvastatin in a dosage of 80 mg per day had significantly lower mortality 30 days after MI than those given standard therapy of pravastatin in a dosage of 40 mg per day. 14 Evidence supporting the use of fibrates for secondary prevention in patients with CAD has been mixed. Gemfibrozil reduced nonfatal MI and cardiovascular death in patients with CAD, but bezafibrate was unable to reproduce significant benefits unless triglyceride levels were more than 200 mg per dL. In one meta-analysis that evaluated beta-blocker therapy in patients with CAD, investigators found a 23 percent reduction in the risk of death.

22 A recent meta-analysis with 464, 000 patients confirmed that beta blockers should be first-line therapy in patients with CAD. 25 In another study, perindopril reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or MI. 26 Researchers conducting a meta-analysis found that after three years of treatment with ACE inhibitors in patients following MI, cardiovascular mortality was reduced compared with placebo.
27. 18 This was confirmed in several trials. 18, 28–30 One trial compared losartan and captopril in patients with CAD and found similar outcomes for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death. 28 In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial, valsartan was as effective as an ACE inhibitor in reducing mortality rates. One study found that short-acting nifedipine was associated with a dose-related increase in mortality and, therefore, should be avoided.

Long-acting calcium channel blockers, however, have a therapeutic role in patients with CAD. 31 Another study found that amlodipine reduced cardiovascular events compared with placebo, and showed similar improvements in cardiovascular events when compared with enalapril. 32 Investigators comparing amlodipine with valsartan found similar cardiovascular outcomes, although amlodipine significantly reduced the risk of heart failure. 33.

### Effects of antidepressant medication on morbidity and mortality in depressed patients after myocardial infarction… [^115Cw5f6]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depressed patients who experience an acute MI might reduce subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A controlled trial is needed to examine this important issue. The odds ratio for MI among SSRI users compared with nonusers was 0.
35. Non-SSRI antidepressant users had a nonsignificant reduction in MI risk with wide CIs. Hence, overall, the evidence suggests that SSRIs are safe in patients with CVD and may even reduce post-MI morbidity and mortality. Based on self-report, the median duration of antidepressant treatment was approximately 12 months for both groups. Individuals in the PI arm with an HRSD score of 25 or higher after 5 weeks of CBT were to be examined for pharmacologic treatment with sertraline according to protocol-specified procedures. In the PI group, 35.

3% of patients with an HRSD score of 25 or higher were given antidepressants. By using a time-dependent multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model to adjust for baseline depression score and cardiac risk factors, SSRI use was associated with 43% lower risk of death or nonfatal MI and 43% lower risk of all-cause mortality. The use of other antidepressants was associated with lower HRs, but the results were not significant. The main finding of this study is that antidepressant use post-AMI by depressed patients in the ENRICHD clinical trial was associated with significantly lower rates of the study primary end points, death and reinfarction. Depressed patients reporting SSRI use post-AMI had a relative risk of death or recurrent MI of 0. 57, adjusted for disease severity and other factors, compared with nonusers.

These analyses reflect the effects on morbidity and mortality when individuals are using antidepressants and do not address the effects of antidepressants when they are discontinued. Many patients received aspirin, β-blockers, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during the later phases of recovery. 7 The fact that our patients received aggressive state-of-the-art care confirms the applicability of our data to contemporary MI patients.

### Intensive statin therapy improves outcomes in patients with CAD… [^111TPn9v]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Several randomized controlled trials of statin therapy have confirmed that every 39 mg per dL reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is associated with a 21 percent reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular events and a 12 percent reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality. The lowest optimal LDL cholesterol level remains unknown, and the recommended target levels differ between North American and European expert groups. Josan and colleagues reviewed the evidence for safety and effectiveness of intensive statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. The Study: The meta-analysis included randomized clinical trials that compared different regimens of statin therapy intensity in adults with CAD, and that reported cardiovascular events or mortality as outcomes. Studies that used much lower doses of statins in the control group than are currently used in clinical practice were excluded.

From 116 articles identified, seven trials with 29, 395 patients met inclusion criteria. Intensive statin therapy was associated with a 25 percent reduction in mortality in patients following acute coronary syndromes, but it had no impact on mortality in patients with chronic CAD. When all seven trials were combined, intensive statin therapy had no significant impact on all-cause mortality. Intensive statin therapy was associated with significant reductions in myocardial infarction, coronary death, major cardiovascular events, and stroke in patients following acute coronary syndromes and in those with chronic CAD. Intensive statin therapy was not associated with a significantly higher discontinuation rate from drug-related adverse events compared with less intensive statin therapy. In five trials, the risk of elevated aminotransferase levels was significantly increased in the intensive statin treatment group.

Other adverse events, such as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, were inconsistently reported, but they appeared to be uncommon and did not occur significantly more often with intensive therapy. Conclusion: The authors conclude that more intensive statin therapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with established CAD. The evidence to support specific LDL cholesterol level targets is currently insufficient, and further research is needed.
