## Question

A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of cramping lower abdominal pain and bloating over the past 3 months. These episodes are often associated with non-bloody, watery, frothy stools, and excessive flatulence. The cramping does not subside after defecation. She reports that her symptoms typically begin an hour or two after eating ice cream, cheese, or pudding. She is otherwise healthy. Her only medication is an iron supplement and an oral contraceptive pill. The patient's height is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) and her weight is 59 kg (130 lb); her BMI is 23.6 kg/m2. Abdominal examination is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Fecal fat test
B. Jejunal biopsy
C. Hydrogen breath test
D. Serum IgE levels

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which test is the most appropriate next step in management for a 26-year-old woman with cramping, bloating, and watery stools that occur about 1–2 hours after dairy ingestion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the history and timing fit lactose malabsorption and intolerance. Then, I should verify the recommended first-line diagnostic approach for suspected lactose intolerance. Next, I will consider reasonable alternatives if a hydrogen breath test is not available. After that, I need to check for red flags that would shift testing toward other diagnoses. Finally, I will review the options and choose the best answer based on guidelines and pathophysiology.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture: the patient's postprandial symptoms of cramping, bloating, flatulence, and watery stools occurring roughly 1–2 hours after dairy intake are classic for lactose malabsorption with resultant osmotic diarrhea and colonic fermentation; importantly, there are no red flags such as weight loss, bleeding, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, fever, or family history of IBD/celiac/colon cancer, which keeps the pretest probability high for lactose intolerance rather than an organic process like celiac disease, IBD, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^111YnQRV] [^112Rbjc6] [^111z25Sj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the first-line diagnostic recommendation. The AGA clinical practice update advises that the simplest and most economically sound approach to suspected carbohydrate intolerance, including lactose, is a short-term dietary restriction of the offending carbohydrate for about 2 weeks with symptom resolution as a positive predictor; breath testing is reserved for patients who do not respond or in whom confirmation is needed, which aligns with a "test when necessary" strategy rather than routine upfront testing [^113udJzL]. The British Society of Gastroenterology similarly supports considering hydrogen breath testing or a withdrawal of dietary lactose when lactose maldigestion is suspected, reinforcing that breath testing is appropriate but not mandatory as the initial step in all cases [^113zsYjB].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the hydrogen breath test itself. The hydrogen breath test directly detects colonic fermentation of undigested lactose and correlates with symptom generation; it is noninvasive, widely available, and remains the most specific objective test for lactose malabsorption when confirmation is desired or when dietary restriction is inconclusive or impractical, which fits this patient's request for a definitive test in a shared decision-making context [^111e1KnM] [^111YnQRV].

> I need to check the alternatives against the clinical question. A fecal fat test is used to screen for fat malabsorption and steatorrhea, which would be more consistent with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or celiac disease rather than lactose intolerance; given the watery, non-greasy stools and lack of weight loss or fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, fecal fat is not the best next test here [^111z25Sj]. Jejunal biopsy is invasive and indicated when celiac disease is suspected based on positive serology or alarm features, not for straightforward lactose intolerance; in the absence of red flags or positive tTG/IgA, jejunal biopsy would be premature and overly invasive here [^113y34Dt]. Serum IgE testing is for atopic or IgE-mediated food allergy, whereas lactose intolerance is non–IgE-mediated and enzyme-deficiency related; thus, IgE would not help confirm lactose malabsorption in this scenario [^116yTEme].

> But wait, what if this is IBS-D with lactose sensitivity rather than primary lactase deficiency? I should confirm that the timing and meal-related nature still favor lactose malabsorption, and that the absence of pain relief with defecation and the specific dairy trigger argue against IBS-D as the sole explanation; nonetheless, if symptoms persist despite lactose restriction, broader dietary strategies such as a structured low-FODMAP approach can be considered, ideally with dietitian guidance, recognizing that breath testing may help clarify multiple concurrent carbohydrate intolerances in refractory cases [^111rpC7o] [^113udJzL].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next step in this specific case. While a 1–2 week dairy-free trial is a perfectly acceptable first-line approach, the question explicitly asks for the most appropriate confirmatory test; in that context, the hydrogen breath test is the most appropriate next step to objectively confirm lactose malabsorption and correlate with symptoms, especially if the patient prefers a definitive diagnosis or if dietary adherence is uncertain [^113udJzL] [^113zsYjB].

> Final answer: Hydrogen breath test (Option C) is the most appropriate next step to confirm suspected lactose intolerance in this patient, with the understanding that a short dairy elimination trial is a reasonable alternative first-line strategy in routine practice [^113udJzL] [^113zsYjB].

---

The most appropriate next step is a **hydrogen breath test** to confirm lactose malabsorption, given the classic history of symptoms triggered by dairy and the absence of red flags [^111GvyRs] [^113zsYjB]. This noninvasive test directly assesses lactose fermentation and is preferred over a fecal fat test (for fat malabsorption), jejunal biopsy (for celiac disease), or serum IgE (for allergy), which are not indicated here [^111YnQRV] [^113y34Dt] [^111M3YMR]. If the breath test is unavailable, a **structured lactose-free trial** is a reasonable alternative [^113zsYjB].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

- **Lactose intolerance**: Characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea after ingestion of lactose-containing foods, due to lactase deficiency [^116yTEme].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: A functional gastrointestinal disorder with similar symptoms but typically associated with stress or anxiety and relieved by defecation [^116gPXVW].

- **Celiac disease**: An immune-mediated reaction to gluten, causing malabsorption and gastrointestinal symptoms [^116Aitd6].

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Characterized by excessive bacterial growth in the small intestine, causing bloating, diarrhea, and malabsorption [^111iUxyf].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, typically associated with weight loss, anemia, and systemic symptoms [^1179c27k].

Given the patient's history of symptoms specifically triggered by dairy products and the absence of systemic symptoms or weight loss, **lactose intolerance is the most likely diagnosis** [^116yTEme].

---

## Diagnostic tests

Among the available diagnostic tests, the **hydrogen breath test** is the most appropriate next step in management. This noninvasive test measures hydrogen gas produced by bacterial fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon. After an overnight fast, the patient ingests a lactose solution, and breath hydrogen is measured at regular intervals. A rise in breath hydrogen above baseline confirms lactose malabsorption [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for hydrogen breath test

The hydrogen breath test is preferred because it is:

- **Noninvasive**: No need for blood draws or invasive procedures.

- **Highly specific and sensitive**: Accurately detects lactose malabsorption [^notfound].

- **Cost-effective**: Less expensive than invasive tests such as jejunal biopsy [^113udJzL].

- **Quick and convenient**: Results are typically available within a few hours.

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

If the hydrogen breath test is unavailable, a **structured lactose-free dietary trial** for 1–2 weeks with symptom monitoring is a reasonable alternative [^113udJzL]. However, this approach is less specific and may be influenced by patient adherence and placebo effects [^111e1KnM].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a **hydrogen breath test** to confirm lactose malabsorption. This test is noninvasive, highly specific, and cost-effective, making it the preferred diagnostic approach in this clinical scenario [^111e1KnM]. If the test is unavailable, a structured lactose-free dietary trial may be considered as an alternative [^113zsYjB].

ALGORITHMS TO AID THE RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FACP

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP, and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction. To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin. For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation with first-line antispasmodic therapy.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112owug1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint, which may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is likely caused by a variety of, probably partly unknown, etiologies. Effective management of FACP can be challenging owing to the lack of usable diagnostic tools and the availability of a diverse range of treatment approaches. Practical guidance for their selection and use is limited. The objective of this article is to present a working definition of FACP based on expert consensus, and to propose practical strategies for the diagnosis and management of this condition for physicians, pharmacists, and patients. A panel of experts on functional gastrointestinal disorders was convened to participate in workshop activities aimed at defining FACP and agreeing upon a recommended sequence of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations. The key principles forming the foundation of the definition of FACP and suggested management algorithms include the primacy of cramping pain as the distinguishing symptom; the importance of recognizing and acting upon alarm signals of potential structural disease; the recognition of known causes that might be addressed through lifestyle adjustment; and the central role of antispasmodics in the treatment of FACP. The proposed algorithm is intended to assist physicians in reaching a meaningful diagnostic endpoint based on patient-reported symptoms of FACP. We also discuss how this algorithm may be adapted for use by pharmacists and patients.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF FACP IN PRIMARY CARE

Recommendations:

Mild, infrequent episodes of FACP may only require reassurance and advice (including avoidance of trigger foods), whereas more intensive and/or frequent episodes usually require therapeutic intervention.
Many patients with FACP who present to primary care may require empirical treatment with an antispasmodic, the choice of which will depend on local availability and individual preference. If the first drug does not provide adequate symptom relief, it might be worthwhile to try an alternative antispasmodic.
Patients who obtain little or no relief from their FACP with an antispasmodic may benefit from additional analgesia, for example, with acetaminophen (paracetamol).
Patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome may respond to low doses of tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or to the neuromodulator pregabalin.
Relaxation training and targeted psychological interventions may be the helpful adjunctive therapies for selected patients who suffer from stress and/or have preexisting psychiatric comorbidities.

Comments

The management of FACP depends on the intensity and frequency of presentation. The occurrence of mild, infrequent episodes often only requires reassurance and advice, whereas the presentation of more intensive and/or frequent symptoms will usually necessitate therapeutic intervention. It should be noted that FACP in patients with IBS (ie, FACP associated with changes in bowel habits or stool form, according to Rome IV criteria) should be managed in line with current IBS guidelines.–

Among all patients presenting with FACP, there are many considerations for determining the optimal approach to symptom management. Patient-specific factors to be considered include age, sex, onset of pain, location of pain, duration of pain, pain variations, quality of pain, concomitant symptoms, lifestyle, aggravators, and relieving factors. Patients with mild FACP can usually be managed by reassuring them that the cause of their pain is not sinister and by advising them to avoid foods or drinks that may trigger and/or exacerbate symptoms and to avoid stress. Patients may be advised to return to their usual diet if a dietary elimination trial is unsuccessful. As recommended for IBS patients, it also seems sensible to provide general guidance on maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Patients with FACP may also present with other co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. Though they should not be ignored, there is little evidence that treating these symptoms and improving bowel habits will, in isolation, improve FACP.

### Indolent systemic mastocytosis and aleukemic mast cell leukemia: subtle diagnostic differences with distinct management approaches [^113Tk9zH]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

GI symptoms are present in 70% of patients with systemic mastocytosis, and often manifest vaguely through bloating and abdominal pain. Diarrhea is more often episodic than chronic, as seen in this patient, linked to the release of mast cell antihistamine and prostaglandins. Hepatomegaly is detected only in 10% to 40% of cases, with abnormal LFTs even less common. Mast cells may also play a role in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer; overall, however, because of the lack of endoscopic biopsies, the true extent of GI involvement in systemic mastocytosis is poorly defined. Management involves the avoidance of triggers as the most important step in preventing GI symptoms.

We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with ISM. This case highlights the importance of workup and the pivotal role of thorough bone marrow investigation in adult patients with mastocytosis for appropriate diagnosis, prognostication, and management.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — senna: Recommendation 6 states that in adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna. Implementation considerations state that while the trials were conducted for 4 wk, longer term use is probably appropriate, but data are needed to better understand tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used doses in practice, the panel suggests starting at lower dose and increase if no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Masquerading in the midgut: a rare diagnosis in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain [^1144NRKf]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome was seen in the outpatient clinic with a 2-year history of intermittent cramp-like abdominal pain which was often followed by watery diarrhoea. She had presented several times previously to the emergency department with episodes of severe pain and collapse although on arrival examination findings were mostly unremarkable other than some mild lower abdominal tenderness. On each occasion, the symptoms resolved spontaneously with conservative management. She had been extensively investigated by her general practitioner to establish the cause of her symptoms but all laboratory findings, cross-sectional imaging, ultrasound and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to date were unremarkable. After being seen in gastroenterology outpatients' clinic, a colonoscopy was performed and was described as being macroscopically normal but microscopic evaluation of colonic biopsies suggested a possible 'resolving infection'. She was treated symptomatically, but within 6 months she represented to hospital with progressively worsening symptoms of severe abdominal pain, now associated with vomiting, followed by watery diarrhoea and then resolution of the symptoms. An abdominal CT scan was performed which showed a small intraluminal-filling defect in the mid-terminal ileum. A wireless capsule endoscopy was organised to further characterise the lesion although this was reported as showing no abnormality. Prior to any further outpatient investigations, she represented as an emergency to hospital in small bowel obstruction, underwent further cross-sectional imaging followed by surgical resection of the lesion. Histological characterisation revealed a small bowel inflammatory fibroid polyp.

PERT is effective for treating EPI (below). Patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as bloating, excess gas, and foul-smelling or floating stools may not have some improvement in these symptoms while taking PERT, but these symptoms are nonspecific and symptomatic changes may be a placebo effect or masking other disorders, such as celiac disease, causing delays in a correct diagnosis. Appropriate testing (eg, fecal elastase) should be suggested before initiating therapy with PERT.

### A randomised controlled trial of a probiotic' functional food'in the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^1127sbEc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Implication for future research or clinical practice

Clinicians advising patients with IBS managed in the community featuring a constipation element may wish to suggest the inclusion of a fermented dairy product, given that significant improvements were reported for most outcomes in all trial participants. The requirement of such products to contain a probiotic is not supported by this study.

Further research is required to consider the mechanism via which improvement in symptoms may be effected in trials of this nature through consideration of dietary habits and fluid intake. Such work will ensure the most accurate dietary advice can be provided to patients.

### Lactose intolerance [^116yTEme]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose because of a genetically inadequate amount of the enzyme lactase. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 15 percent of persons of northern European descent, up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 12 oz of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake.

### The science, evidence, and practice of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome [^112uNiCn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder that is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates published trials.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty, and in turn frustration of both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### A randomised controlled trial of a probiotic' functional food'in the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^113bZshC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterised by pain, distension and altered bowel habit. Evidence suggests functional foods containing probiotics improve gastrointestinal transit, however, data are limited by short follow-up periods and evaluation in selected populations.

Methods

A multi-centre, randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a probiotic vs non-probiotic dairy product on symptoms in IBS with a constipation element (IBS – Constipation or IBS – Mixed profile). Set in 13 general practices within central England. Individuals meeting the ROME III criteria for IBS, aged 18–65 completed a pre-study diary. Eligible individuals were randomized to consume dairy 'yoghurt' products which either did or did not contain active probiotics twice daily and to complete a daily diary. Primary outcome was subjective global assessment of symptom relief at week 4. Other outcomes comprised, IBS symptom scores, pain, bloating and flatulence levels, stool frequency, stool consistency, ease of bowel movement and quality of life.

Results

179 were randomized (91 active, 88 placebo). 76 (43 active, 33 placebo) completed the study. No significant between group differences existed at 4 weeks (57% active vs 53% placebo, reported adequate relief (p = 0.71)). By week 8, 46% active vs 68% placebo reported adequate relief (p = 0.03). This was sustained at week 12.

Conclusions

Significant improvements were reported for most outcomes in all trial participants but improvement did not differ by group. This trial does not provide evidence for effectiveness of a probiotic in IBS, in variance with a body of published literature and review conclusions. Differential drop out may however cloud interpretation of data.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^114ZvYz6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^113udJzL]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Dietary carbohydrate intolerance and diagnostic approach — In patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBIs), "fructose intolerance was more common — seen in 60% of patients — and was higher than lactose intolerance (51%), and its prevalence was similar across all major types of DGBIs, except IBS-C". The "simplest and most economically sound way to diagnose any food intolerance is usually a dietary restriction of short duration (2 weeks), with resolution of symptoms as a positive predictor". Breath testing, "which measures hydrogen, methane, and CO2, is a better low-cost option, albeit reserved for patients refractory to dietary restrictions first and suspected lactose, fructose, or sucrose intolerances".

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116Aitd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease, such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials, but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future for the optimal detection of patients.

### Guide to managing persistent upper gastrointestinal symptoms during and after treatment for cancer [^116TcHrV]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Management of carbohydrate malabsorption

For example, lactose or other disaccharide intolerance.

Definition

Intolerance occurs from the inability to digest carbohydrates. Lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products, is the intolerance most frequently recognised. It is due to lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine. Primary hypolactasia affects 70% of the world's population. Lactose or other disaccharide or monosaccharide (eg, fructose) malabsorption may occur de novo during cancer therapies (such as 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy or radiotherapy), due to damage to brush border enzymes and in some patients persists in the long term.

Diagnosis of carbohydrate intolerance

Trial of exclusion of products containing that specific carbohydrate in diet for 1–2 weeks. Patient to keep a record of symptoms before and during the exclusion.
Specific carbohydrate breath test. Maybe falsely positive in the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
Small intestine biopsies and assessment for the specific disaccharide or monosaccharide activity.

Treatment

Long-term exclusion of products containing the carbohydrate in diet.
Dietetic assessment to ensure diet remains balanced. With lactose intolerance special attention should be paid to calcium intake. Other bone health risk factors should also be considered and vitamin and mineral supplementation started as appropriate.
Consideration of a low fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols diet.
Oral lactases for isolated lactose intolerance.

Tegaserod for IBS-C — conditional recommendation and supporting evidence: We suggest that the 5-HT4 agonist tegaserod be used to treat IBS-C symptoms in women younger than 65 years with ≤ 1 cardiovascular risk factors who have not adequately responded to secretagogues. Conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence. Eleven randomized, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of tegaserod for IBS-C; 2 of the 3 pivotal studies that led to US FDA approval are reviewed here. In one multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial, 881 patients were treated with placebo or tegaserod (2 or 6 mg b.i.d.). A second large multinational trial comparing tegaserod 6 mg b.i.d. with placebo over 12 weeks found the SGA primary endpoint in 43.5% vs 38.8% (P < 0.033), with secondary improvements in abdominal pain (P < 0.003), stool consistency (P < 0.0001), stool frequency (P < 0.05), and bloating (P < 0.05). Meta-analysis across 9,242 patients reported Rome I in 6 trials and Rome II in 5; nine trials used 6 mg bid, and tegaserod reduced persistent IBS-C symptoms vs placebo (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80–0.90). In clinical trials, diarrhea occurred in 6% on tegaserod vs 2% on placebo (P > 0.05), and the drug was approved for IBS-C in women in 2002 but voluntarily withdrawn 5 years later because of concerns over a small excess of cardiovascular events.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^111rpC7o]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

In many clinical studies, only a minority of patients with LI on HBT report satisfactory improvement in symptoms after treatment to reduce intake of dairy products or supplement lactase. Moreover, it remains unclear, to what extent the therapy itself and conditioning of patient expectations contribute to outcome. Lack of improvement can also be due to the presence of functional bowel disorders, which are present in many patients referred for investigation. These patients are sensitive to various nutrients, mechanical and chemical stimuli and, therefore, rarely respond to restriction of dairy products alone.

IBS patients develop symptoms after ingestion of a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)) that includes but is not restricted to lactose even in LM patients. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in 50%–80% of IBS patients. This dietary therapy requires commitment from the patient and is best delivered by professional dietician. Identification of factors predicting dietary outcome would improve compliance and cost-effectiveness of this intervention; however, in a large clinical study neither clinical presentation nor HBT results (high dose lactose 50 g or fructose 35 g) predicted response to the low-FODMAP diet. The response to an intermediate dose of a representative, non-absorbable FODMAP (eg, lactulose 20 g) that rarely c symptoms in health, but often induces bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhea in FGID patients may improve the ability of HBT to identify individuals that respond to this dietary intervention. Alternatively, bioassays to identify saccharolytic bacteria and/or fermentation capacity in faecal samples might be developed that predict outcome of lactose (or FODMAP) restriction in patients.

### Management of refractory pain in stiff-person syndrome [^112LY9EZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterised by episodic painful muscle rigidity and violent spasms. A significant trigger for the painful spasms experienced by patients is pain itself, making optimal pain management and avoidance a necessity. While first-line and second-line therapies for spasm prevention and termination are known, there is a paucity of evidence to guide pain management. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with SPS referred for excruciating muscle cramping and rigidity with pain lasting beyond the episodes themselves. We report the novel use of ketamine and intravenous magnesium sulfate which may provide analgesia, spasm avoidance and early termination of exacerbations in SPS.

### Prevalence and patterns of laxative use in subjects with self-reported constipation: results from a multinational digestive health survey [^112AGEya]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The data on self-reported constipation in the past 6 months and at the most recent episode demonstrate that most subjects also experience additional GI symptoms possibly related to constipation, confirming clinical experience, and some definitions, that recognize constipation as a poly-symptomatic disorder. Frequently reported associated symptoms included (some of which are part of the definition of constipation) hard, dry stools, gas/flatulence/belching, irregular bowel movements, bloating/distension, indigestion, nausea/upset stomach, and belly cramps or pain. The overall predominance of these symptoms was more or less observed across all countries, explaining the relevance of constipation for QoL impairment. Almost 80% reported a frequency of constipation episodes between once every 2–3 months and every 2–3 weeks, demonstrating that chronic recurrence of constipation is a major health issue for concerned subjects. This was highlighted by the negative impact on QoL with a higher frequency of constipation episodes emphasizing the need for treatment that reliably resolves or eases the symptoms of constipation.

### Microscopic colitis impacts quality of life in older people [^115zWePj]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

This report describes a frail 92-year-old woman with dementia who presented with a year's history of chronic watery non-bloody diarrhoea. She had abdominal bloating, weight loss, faecal urgency, nocturnal stools and developed faecal incontinence. Her serum C reactive peptide and faecal calprotectin were elevated. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was macroscopically normal, but demonstrated histological features of microscopic colitis (MC) in sigmoid colon and rectal biopsies. Polypharmacy was reviewed for possible medication-induced MC. Ranitidine, donepezil and simvastatin were discontinued. She was started on oral budesonide with improvement in the abdominal and bowel symptoms. Stool frequency and consistency normalised, and the faecal incontinence resolved with treatment. The outcomes were an improved quality of life, reduced functional dependency, reduced carer strain and avoidance of premature transition from her home into a long-term/institutionalcare setting. We briefly review terminology, basic epidemiology, notable associations, the importance of establishing a diagnosis and some treatment considerations for MC.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^116S4pef]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance and quality of life

Like other functional GI disorders, LI is not a trivial condition but has a negative impact on quality of life and nutrition. Anxiety increases the risk of symptoms ('intolerance') after lactose ingestion, but the fear that food will trigger bloating, pain and diarrhoea is also a cause of anxiety. Indeed, in studies, not only patients with LI but also those with self-diagnosed LI who do not have the condition describe a lower quality of life than individuals without concerns about food intolerance. This anxiety generalises to other foods, and patients with LI often describe intolerance to a range of products, especially those known to cause bloating (eg, legumes and dried fruit). As a result, individuals might adopt a restrictive diet that could impact on health in a variety of ways. In severe cases, this form of behaviour is termed avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder by DSM-5, a form of eating disorder that is associated with weight loss but not with body dysmorphia.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^111GvyRs]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) best practice advice for diagnostic evaluation of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention includes the following statements. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinical history and physical examination findings and impedance pH monitoring can help to differentiate between supragastric and gastric belching. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Rome IV criteria should be used to diagnose primary abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Carbohydrate enzyme deficiencies may be ruled out with dietary restriction and/or breath testing. In a small subset of at-risk patients, small bowel aspiration and glucose- or lactose-based hydrogen breath testing may be used to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Serologic testing may rule out celiac disease in patients with bloating and, if serologies are positive, a small bowel biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. A gastroenterology dietitian should be part of the multidisciplinary approach to care for patients with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Abdominal imaging and upper endoscopy should be ordered in patients with alarm features, recent worsening symptoms, or an abnormal physical examination only. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Gastric emptying studies should not be ordered routinely for bloating and distention, but may be considered if nausea and vomiting are present. Whole gut motility and radiopaque transit studies should not be ordered unless other additional and treatment-refractory lower gastrointestinal symptoms exist to warrant testing for neuromuscular disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In patients with abdominal bloating and distention thought to be related to constipation or difficult evacuation, anorectal physiology testing is suggested to rule out a pelvic floor disorder.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^111YnQRV]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a necessary precondition for lactose intolerance (LI). However, the two must not be confused and the causes of symptoms must be considered separately. Many individuals with LM have no symptoms after ingestion of a standard serving of dairy products (table 1) whereas others develop symptoms ('intolerance') such as abdominal pain, borborygmi (rumbling tummy) and bloating after lactose intake (figure 1). The onset of these symptoms is strongly correlated to the appearance of hydrogen gas during breath tests. Further, undigested lactose in the small intestine lead to osmotic trapping of water and the osmotic load in the colon is increased about eightfold by fermentation of lactose to SCFA. Diarrhoea will result if the respective load of lactose exceeds the capacity of the colonic microbiota for fermentation or the SCFA load exceeds the colon capacity for resorption.

The likelihood of developing symptoms after lactose ingestion is multifactorial (figure 3). Extrinsic factors include the amount of lactose ingested and whether dairy products are ingested with other foods that affect intestinal transit and the rate of lactose delivery to the colon. Intrinsic factors include expression of lactase at the brush border of the small intestine, history of GI disorders or abdominal surgery and the composition of the intestinal microbiome. When incubated in vitro with lactose, faecal samples from lactose-intolerant subjects mediated faster and higher production of SCFA than samples from lactose-tolerant subjects. However, an impact of SCFA on symptoms has not been directly demonstrated in humans. Further, in the anaerobic environment of the intestinal tract, generation of reducing equivalents result in rapid hydrogen production, and in several clinical studies, the amount of gas production correlated with the presence and severity of intestinal symptoms. Other patient factors not directly related to lactose digestion are also associated with LI. These include the presence of anxiety disorders, high levels of psychosocial stress and the presence of functional GI disorders such as IBS (figures 3 and 4).

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112Rbjc6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

PRECAUTIONS:

General: Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution.

Information for patients: PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution.

Drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters and it is best to drink all of the solution. Any unused portion should be discarded.

### Bilateral massive leiomyomas in a bicornuate uterus, with torsion of the right horn [^116n3nkK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

An African American woman in her 30s presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient reported a progressive worsening of this pain over the past week, despite using over-the-counter medications. She described the pain as sharp, non-migrating and persistent, with no periods of relief. She also noted episodes of constipation, which she had previously attributed as the cause of her pain in the past. She revealed a 2-year history of intermittent abdominal pain, bloating and abdominal distension, which she assumed was related to weight gain. Additionally, she reported a long-standing history of constipation that was typically relieved with over-the-counter stool softeners. Over the past year, however, she had noticed a marked increase in abdominal distension accompanied by more frequent and severe episodes of pain. Although she had successfully managed her pain with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen in the past, this current episode had persisted and worsened despite its use. She denied a history of unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite or difficulty with urination. Her gynaecological history included a history of irregular menstrual cycles with occasional heavy bleeding, and she was previously diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome in 2021. She endorsed a known history of leiomyomas since 2020 but was not aware of the size or any other uterine abnormalities. She denied the use of contraceptives and had never been pregnant or attempted pregnancy before. She denied any medical issues or prior abdominal surgery. She had a desire for future fertility.

Postprandial pain which starts soon after eating and lasts for an hour or so, often requiring people to take to their bed, may indicate that the person is trying to eat too much at one sitting. Rarely, it indicates mesenteric ischaemia. Postprandial dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea may suggest dumping syndrome or reactive hypoglycaemia but are also symptoms commonly caused by SIBO.

Significant weight loss is common after upper GI surgery. It may be a consequence of the catabolic state from surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapies or cancer recurrence or an imbalance between calorific requirements and dietary intake. Poorly controlled GI symptoms also contribute. Weight loss, although easy to record, may not be as important as changes to body composition or sarcopenia.

Non-specific symptoms are common in this patient group and inadequate investigation risks missing treatable causes. If IBS was not present before surgery, it is unreasonable to attribute them to IBS afterwards. Nocturnal waking to defaecate and steatorrhoea are never features of IBS. A systematic investigative approachcan be very effective to diagnose the potential multiple coexisting diagnoses including BAD, PEI, SIBO, overflow diarrhoea, jejunostomy feed related diarrhoea, malabsorption syndromes and late dumping syndrome. Further contributing factors may include alimentary and lifestyle issues, such as too much or too little fibre, excessive alcohol, excessive caffeine, excess consumption of drinks containing artificial sweeteners or side effects of prescribed medication. Lower GI symptoms are common after upper GI surgery and should be investigated systematically (table 6).

To identify patients who need appropriate assessment requires patients and clinicians to be vigilant and to understand that the development of chronic symptoms is not 'normal' and that dietetic support usually needs to be supplemented by an appropriate systematic investigation so that the underlying cause(s) can be correctly diagnosed and treated. It is of note that contrast studies and/or gastric emptying studies for the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying are compromised by a lack of standard normal range values in this specific patient group and if undertaken, should be interpreted with caution.

Case presentation

A 49-year-old Caucasian woman, with past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, dyslipidemia and hypertension, presented to the emergency department with cramping-like abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea that started few weeks prior to presentation. Abdominal pain was generalized before becoming localized to the epigastrium, without radiation. No alleviating or aggravating factors were noted. She had frequent, watery to loose, non-bloody bowel movements.

Patient denied dysphagia or odynophagia, and had no fever, chills, skin rashes or joint pains. She denied any recent travel, sick contact or antibiotics use prior to onset of symptoms. Review of systems was unremarkable. Surgical history included cholecystectomy. Patient did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. No family history of similar symptoms.

Patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Prior to hospitalization, patient was evaluated and treated at two different healthcare facilities (including one hospital admission) for similar symptoms. There, she had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast that showed fluid-filled bowels and thickened colonic wall, and she was released from the hospital on empirical antibiotics for presumed infectious enterocolitis, but symptoms recurred soon after hospital discharge.

On physical examination the patient appeared in moderate pain and distress. Vital signs showed an elevated blood pressure of 146/93 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a normal temperature of 36.5 °C.

Abdominal exam showed generalized tenderness that was worse in the epigastrium with no rebound tenderness or abdominal distention. Bowel sounds were normal. There was no palpable organomegaly.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^111iUxyf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

SIBO symptoms and symptom-based diagnostic limitations — Evidence suggests that abdominal pain, bloating, gas, distension, flatulence, and diarrhea are the most common symptoms reported in patients with SIBO, with severe cases sometimes showing vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficiencies that are usually subtle or undetectable. However, in one study that compared symptom burden, Jacobs et al. compared 38 subjects with culture-positive SIBO to 74 subjects with culture-negative SIBO and reported no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain or in bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. Therefore, close attention should be paid not only to a patient's symptom profile but also to risk factors for SIBO and any history of previous attempts to treat other underlying conditions, when evaluating SIBO as a possible diagnosis in a patient presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and/or malabsorptive symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^117XCa97]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

Belching, bloating, and abdominal distention are all highly prevalent gastrointestinal symptoms and account for some of the most common reasons for patient visits to outpatient gastroenterology practices. These symptoms are often debilitating, affecting patients' quality of life, and contributing to work absenteeism. Belching and bloating differ in their pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management, and there is limited evidence available for their various treatments. Therefore, the purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update is to provide best practice advice based on both controlled trials and observational data for clinicians covering clinical features, diagnostics, and management considerations that include dietary, gut-directed behavioral, and drug therapies.

Methods

This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These best practice advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature based on clinical trials, the more robust observational studies, and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these best practice advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinical history and physical examination findings and impedance pH monitoring can help to differentiate between gastric and supragastric belching. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Treatment options for supragastric belching may include brain-gut behavioral therapies, either separately or in combination, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, speech therapy, and central neuromodulators. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Rome IV criteria should be used to diagnose primary abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Carbohydrate enzyme deficiencies may be ruled out with dietary restriction and/or breath testing. In a small subset of at-risk patients, small bowel aspiration and glucose- or lactulose-based hydrogen breath testing may be used to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Serologic testing may rule out celiac disease in patients with bloating and, if serologies are positive, a small bowel biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. A gastroenterology dietitian should be part of the multidisciplinary approach to care for patients with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Abdominal imaging and upper endoscopy should be ordered in patients with alarm features, recent worsening symptoms, or an abnormal physical examination only. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Gastric emptying studies should not be ordered routinely for bloating and distention, but may be considered if nausea and vomiting are present. Whole gut motility and radiopaque transit studies should not be ordered unless other additional and treatment-refractory lower gastrointestinal symptoms exist to warrant testing for neuromyopathic disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In patients with abdominal bloating and distention thought to be related to constipation or difficult evacuation, anorectal physiology testing is suggested to rule out a pelvic floor disorder. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: When dietary modifications are needed (eg, low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet), a gastroenterology dietitian should preferably monitor treatment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Probiotics should not be used to treat abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Biofeedback therapy may be effective for bloating and distention when a pelvic floor disorder is identified. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Central neuromodulators (eg, antidepressants) are used to treat bloating and abdominal distention by reducing visceral hypersensitivity, raising sensation threshold, and improving psychological comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Medications used to treat constipation should be considered for treating bloating if constipation symptoms are present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Psychological therapies, such as hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other brain-gut behavior therapies may be used to treat patients with bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE 15: Diaphragmatic breathing and central neuromodulators are used to treat abdominophrenic dyssynergia.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

Clinical Presentation

A 28-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of chronic watery diarrhoea along with abdominal pain and bloating, which could mostly be alleviated after defecation. Her symptom of diarrhoea, at least three times a day, could be relieved by neither probiotics nor antidiarrhoeal agents. She had also lost 5 kg in the last month. She denied family history, poor vaccine responses or significant infections in early childhood except for an allergy history to intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) with immediate dyspnoea, palpitations and hypotension. Laboratory investigations suggested that the stool specimens were negative for viruses, parasites or bacteria. Laboratory evaluation revealed a low serum globulin level, 14.5 (reference range, 20–30g/L); serum Ig levels were significantly abnormal: IgA < 0.27 (0.7–4g/L), IgM 0.24 (0.4–2.3g/L), IgG 1.3 (7–16g/L); white cell count 15.4×10 9 /L (3.69–9.16×10 9 /L); C-reactive protein (CRP) 20.5 (normal < 10mg/L); CD4+ lymphocyte/CD8+ lymphocyte 1.09% (1.5%-2%).

Hospital Course

Once admitted, our patient was maintained on intravenous fluids. An abdominal ultrasound was performed during an episode of severe pain, which revealed small bowel–small bowel intussusception (see Figure 1). Pediatric surgery was consulted and recommended bowel rest and pain management. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and morphine. Repeat abdominal ultrasound 2 days later revealed resolution of the intussusception. Her abdominal pain slowly resolved, her diet was advanced, and her pain medications and intravenous fluids were slowly weaned.

Figure 1.
Small bowel–small bowel intussusception. Classic target sign is the radiographic finding on abdominal ultrasound.

During the hospitalization, she continued to have frequent watery stools with abdominal cramping even after her intussusception had resolved. She required regular repletion of magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus due to poor oral intake and excessive stool output. The following stool studies were negative: Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Vibrio, and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Fecal leukocytes were negative. Serologies for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative. Unfortunately, the ova and parasite stool study results were delayed (sent to an outside lab instead of performed in-house), due to the ongoing COVID pandemic and limited testing capabilities. However, on the day prior to discharge, the parasitic panel returned positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, the likely cause of her chronic watery diarrhea. Prescriptions for nitazoxanide 200 mg twice a day for 3 days, a probiotic, and dicyclomine as needed for cramping were prescribed on discharge.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with changes in stool frequency and form. IBS is differentiated further by the predominant bowel habit pattern, such as IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), and IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M). Patients with IBS commonly experience abdominal bloating and distention; these symptoms are supportive of IBS although not required for diagnosis, per Rome IV criteria. In fact, abdominal cramping, bloating, and abdominal pain/discomfort were the three most bothersome symptoms reported in patients with IBS in a study by Ringel and colleagues, in which more than 300 patients were surveyed (IBS-M, 45.1%; IBS-D, 39.2%; IBS-C, 15.7%). Further, patients with IBS often experience impaired quality of life (QOL), and their symptoms can have a significant negative impact on work and activities of daily living. – Survey data indicated that patients with IBS-D (n = 1102) experienced significantly greater impairment of health-related QOL compared with a control group (n = 65,389; p < 0.001). In another study, 76.5% of patients with IBS (n = 179; IBS-M, 58.7%; IBS-D, 31.8%; IBS-C, 9.5%) reported impairment in ⩾5 of 10 domains of daily life (social activity [80%], eating alone [80%], job/school performance [72%], physical activity [68%], eating in groups [65%], leisure activity [63%], household activities [54%], sexual activity [54%], physical appearance [53%], and travel [50%]). Moreover, a greater percentage of patients with IBS (subtype(s) not specified; n = 48) included in a single-center study indicated having poor sleep quality compared with healthy individuals (72% versus 39%, respectively). Survey data also indicated that IBS can negatively affect the ability to work, such that patients with IBS-D reported more work absenteeism compared with controls (5.1% versus 2.9%, respectively; p = 0.004) and had significantly greater loss of overall work productivity (20.7% versus 13.2%, respectively; p < 0.001).

### Do the symptom-based, Rome criteria of irritable bowel syndrome lead to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes? The con argument [^114FFJ5M]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Some claim that symptom-based Rome criteria are diagnostic and enhance clinical practice and choice of therapy for patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. This overview focuses on lower gastrointestinal symptoms: constipation, diarrhea, pain and bloating. The main con arguments for using such criteria for diagnosis are: insufficient specificity, overlap of symptom-based categories or disorders, insufficient and therefore non-specific characterization of pain in the criteria, inability to differentiate the "mimics" of IBS-C and IBS-D, and inability to optimize treatment for IBS-M or bloating in the absence of objective measurements. While doctors may not land in trouble using "symptom diagnosis" of IBS, this should not deter them from optimizing diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

### The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: when to investigate and how? [^11232DYU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that 'it could be something else'? Could one miss 'something serious'? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.

Recent Findings

Clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remain uncertain.

Summary

Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. Wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. Proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.

### Effect of raw milk on lactose intolerance: a randomized controlled pilot study [^113eFpZG]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This pilot study aimed to determine whether raw milk reduces lactose malabsorption and/or lactose intolerance symptoms relative to pasteurized milk.

Methods

We performed a crossover trial involving 16 adults with self-reported lactose intolerance and lactose malabsorption confirmed by hydrogen (H2) breath testing. Participants underwent 3, 8-day milk phases (raw vs 2 controls: pasteurized, soy) in randomized order separated by 1-week washout periods. On days 1 and 8 of each phase, milk consumption was 473 mL (16 oz); on days 2 to 7, milk dosage increased daily by 118 mL (4 oz), beginning with 118 mL (4 oz) on day 2 and reaching 710 mL (24 oz) on day 7. Outcomes were area under the breath H2 curve (AUC H2) and self-reported symptom severity (visual analog scales: flatulence/gas, audible bowel sounds, abdominal cramping, diarrhea).

Results

AUC H2 (mean ± standard error of the mean) was higher for raw vs pasteurized on day 1 (113 ± 21 vs 71 ± 12 ppm·min·10(-2), respectively, P = .01) but not day 8 (72 ± 14 vs 74 ± 15 ppm·min·10(-2), respectively, P = .9). Symptom severities were not different for raw vs pasteurized on day 7 with the highest dosage (P > .7). AUC H2 and symptom severities were higher for both dairy milks compared with soy milk.

Conclusions

Raw milk failed to reduce lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance symptoms compared with pasteurized milk among adults positive for lactose malabsorption. These results do not support widespread anecdotal claims that raw milk reduces the symptoms of lactose intolerance.

### Peg-3350 and electrolytes (GoLYTELY) [^117ABVFe]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

General: Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution.

Information for patients: GoLYTELY for Oral Solution produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking GoLYTELY for Oral Solution.

Drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters and it is best to drink all of the solution. Any unused portion should be discarded.

Drug Interactions: Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenic and reproductive studies with animals have not been performed.

Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GoLYTELY for Oral Solution. It is also not known whether GoLYTELY for Oral Solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. GoLYTELY for Oral Solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^111e1KnM]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Testing for lactose intolerance

The major limitation of the genetic, enzymatic and gaxilose tests is that LM is common in healthy individuals, and a positive test does not confirm that symptoms are caused by this condition. For this reason, in our practice, HBT is the method of choice because reasonably reliable information about digestive function and patient symptoms are obtained.

The diagnosis of LI requires appropriate testing of symptoms using validated questionnaires designed for the purpose. A National Institute of Health consensus conference defined LI as 'the onset of GI symptoms following a blinded, single-dose challenge of ingested lactose by an individual with LM, which are not observed when the person ingests an indistinguishable placebo', thus supporting the case for blinded testing of symptoms. Although rarely performed outside clinical studies, blinded testing might be useful since in clinical practice, the correlation between self-reported symptoms of LI and objective findings on tests for lactose digestion is low. Indeed, among individuals referred for HBT, about half of those with normal lactose digestion report abdominal discomfort after an unblinded lactose challenge. Further, intolerance to dairy products is reported by 20% of all individualsand up to 70% of IBS patients in European populations with low rates of genetic LNP.

A 'blinded multiple dose challenge' would provide clarity not only regarding lactose digestion but also identify the amount of lactose that individuals could 'safely' consume (figure 6). Moreover, in subjects with known LNP, these could be performed at patients' homes with a negative control, low and intermediate lactose challenge (eg, 12.5 and 25 g, corresponding to 250 and 500 mL milk, respectively). This could help educate patients because, in real life, it is self-reported intolerance and not the objective results of testing that best predicts food choices. However, to the best of our knowledge, blinded home-based testing has not been tested in routine clinical practice. The need for a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is a key clinical challenge in functional GI disorders. The ability to predict the outcome of dietary therapy would be the measure for an appropriate symptom assessment.

### Isolated gastrointestinal alpha-gal meat allergy is a cause for gastrointestinal distress without anaphylaxis [^111M3YMR]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alpha-gal allergy is characterized by a reaction to beef, pork, and other mammalian meat and derived products, typically hours after ingestion, and is diagnosed by the presence of elevated serum alpha-gal IgE antibodies. – The allergy appears to develop after the bite of a hard tick and has been described in the United States (particularly the southeastern United States; Supplementary Figure 1), Europe, Africa, Australia, Central and South America, and Asia. – Symptoms can include pruritus, rash, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, shock, and anaphylaxis, the latter of which is defined by the involvement of 2 or more systems (skin, gastrointestinal [GI], cardiac, pulmonary). GI symptoms are caused by IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells and histamine receptors in the GI tract.

Management of the allergy includes counseling on the avoidance of mammalian meat and sometimes dairy and other mammalian-derived products. In case of exposure, short- and long-acting oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and fexofenadine may be used to ameliorate both GI and allergic symptoms.

Allergy and oncology journals have primarily published research on alpha-gal allergy, and it has not been described previously in the GI literature. We describe patients with the allergy who presented with isolated GI symptoms.

Post-bariatric surgery disordered eating behaviors — characteristics are outlined across entities with defining features. Anorexia nervosa is noted as rare in this setting and includes features such as extremely low weight, moderate to severe dietary restriction, intense fear of gaining weight, and an unrealistic perception of body weight and image. Loss of control eating is described as patients feeling a loss of control in their eating behaviors, similar to a binge eating episode. Night eating syndrome includes awakening during the night to eat due to hunger or habit. Grazing, picking, and nibbling are described as small or modest amounts of food consumed in a repetitive or unplanned behavior and are associated with inhibiting weight loss and weight recurrence. Dumping is often associated with consuming sweets or dairy products followed by physical symptoms including abdominal pain and diarrhea. Pica is characterized by consuming non-food substances for at least one month, with examples including dirt, raw starches, ice (pagophagia), charcoal, ash, paper, chalk, baby powder, coffee grounds, and eggshells.

### Effect of the consumption of a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on constipation in childhood: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (NTRTC: 1571) [^111YAES8]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a frustrating symptom affecting 3% of children worldwide. Randomised controlled trials show that both polyethylene glycol and lactulose are effective in increasing defecation frequency in children with constipation. However, in 30–50%, these children reported abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea and bad taste of the medication. Two recent studies have shown that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with a defecation frequency < 3/week and in constipated women with a defecation frequency < 3/week. Goal of this study is to determine whether this fermented dairy product is effective in the treatment of constipated children with a defecation frequency < 3/week.

Methods/design

It is a two nation (The Netherlands and Poland) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised multicentre trial in which 160 constipated children (age 3–16 years) with a defecation frequency < 3/week will be randomly allocated to consume a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 or a control product, twice a day, for 3 weeks. During the study all children are instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for 5–10 minutes after each meal (3 times a day) and daily complete a standardized bowel diary. Primary endpoint is stool frequency. Secondary endpoints are stool consistency, faecal incontinence frequency, pain during defecation, digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, flatulence), adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea, bad taste) and intake of rescue medication (Bisacodyl). Rate of success and rate of responders are also evaluated, with success defined as ≥ 3 bowel movements per week and ≤ 1 faecal incontinence episode over the last 2 weeks of product consumption and responder defined as a subject reporting a stool frequency ≥ 3 on the last week of product consumption. To demonstrate that the success percentage in the intervention group will be 35% and the success percentage in the control group (acidified milk without ferments, toilet training, bowel diary) will be 15%, with alpha 0.05 and power 80%, a total sample size of 160 patients was calculated.

Conclusion

This study is aimed to show that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency after 3 weeks of product consumption in children with functional constipation and a defecation frequency < 3/week.

### Reducing pain in experimental models of intestinal inflammation affects the immune response [^1179c27k]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and they differ in manifestations and pathologies. UC mainly affects the colon and is limited to the (sub)mucosa. The inflammation continuously spreads from the rectum to the proximal colon. Whereas in CD, inflammation can occur in the whole gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. The inflammation is discontinuous (skip lesions) and involves all layers of the intestinal wall (transmural). In line with this, the symptoms, though not all, differ in both entities. IBD develops predominantly in the first 3 decades of life. Patients experience diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue as well as abdominal pain. CD mainly manifests in the terminal ileum (terminal ileitis in 40% of the cases). Expressed pointedly, a CD patient is a 20-year-old woman with pain in the right-sided lower abdomen. The pain usually occurs 1–2 hours after meals. She has diarrhea but no bloody stools. Whereas the typical UC patient, also pointedly expressed, is a 20-year-old man, who quit smoking 3 months ago and is experiencing painful defecation. This patient further experiences diarrhea with bloody stools.

### Lower gastrointestinal tract disorders: clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^1119TaAf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lower gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and associated symptoms account for a large number of health care visits each year. Many women visit their obstetrician-gynecologists more often than their primary care physicians or use them as primary health care providers. Many gynecologic and lower GI disorders share symptoms, such as lower abdominal or pelvic pain and bloating. Some diseases are more common in women compared with men, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or warrant special consideration in women, for example, for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This monograph outlines the major diseases that affect the lower GI tract and reviews epidemiology, pathology, presentation, and treatment of these diseases. Concerns specific to women are addressed, including reproductive issues, changes in GI physiology during pregnancy, and management of lower GI disease during pregnancy.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.
