## Question

medications to treat insomnia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications to treat insomnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment hierarchy and where pharmacotherapy fits. Then, I should verify which medication classes and specific agents have supportive evidence and how strong that evidence is. Next, I will examine safety, special populations, and duration limits. After that, I should reconcile guideline differences and real-world practice patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight key uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the treatment hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions about medications. CBT-I remains first-line for chronic insomnia disorder because of durable benefits and a favorable risk–benefit profile, and pharmacotherapy is generally reserved for adjunctive or second-line use when CBT-I is unavailable, declined, or insufficient, with shared decision-making about short-term use and close monitoring for harms [^d1ef4a8e] [^f298aefb] [^b6dea782].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of pharmacologic evidence before listing agents. The AASM 2017 guideline issued only weak recommendations for a limited set of drugs, reflecting low-to-moderate quality evidence and the predominance of industry-sponsored, short-term trials; pooled effects on sleep outcomes are small to moderate, and comparative effectiveness across agents remains uncertain, which means I should be cautious about overstating benefits or ranking one drug as clearly superior [^32ca4790] [^e0294aa7] [^8280c532].

> I will now examine benzodiazepine receptor agonists, both benzodiazepines and "Z-drugs", because they have the most consistent short-term efficacy signal. AASM suggests eszopiclone for sleep onset and maintenance, zolpidem for sleep onset and maintenance, zaleplon for sleep onset, and temazepam or triazolam for sleep onset, with the caveat that all recommendations are weak and based on limited, often short-term data; effect sizes are modest, and adverse effects including cognitive impairment, falls, dependence, and next-day impairment are more likely with benzodiazepines and can occur with Z-drugs as well, especially at higher doses or with concomitant CNS depressants [^32ca4790] [^188215fa] [^634db104] [^ce4e066b] [^b1d87a99] [^f0f2005d] [^fc411bcb].

> Hold on, I should verify the orexin receptor antagonist data because it's newer and sometimes overhyped. AASM suggests suvorexant for sleep maintenance insomnia with weak recommendation strength; evidence shows small improvements in sleep maintenance outcomes, and while the mechanism is distinct, safety concerns such as next-day somnolence and impaired driving still apply, so I need to ensure patients are counseled and dosed conservatively, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^32ca4790] [^fc411bcb] [^2dabe99e].

> Let me consider melatonin receptor agonists carefully. AASM recommends against melatonin for primary insomnia based on trials of 2 mg prolonged-release melatonin showing no clinically meaningful benefit; ramelteon has a weak recommendation for sleep onset only, with very low quality evidence and minimal total sleep time gains, so I should not overstate its utility and should avoid melatonin unless there is a clear circadian indication rather than primary insomnia [^2101c92d] [^8cb583c8] [^438fe376] [^75e5dd3c].

> Next, I should review antidepressants, and I need to be careful to separate guideline positions from meta-analytic signals. AASM recommends against trazodone for primary insomnia due to limited efficacy and adverse effects, whereas a Cochrane review suggests small-to-moderate improvements with low-dose doxepin and trazodone on subjective sleep outcomes, albeit with low-to-moderate quality evidence and limited long-term data; European guidance allows consideration of low-dose sedating antidepressants in selected patients after individualized discussion, so I should frame these as conditional, off-label options for comorbid mood symptoms or when first-line hypnotics are unsuitable [^3c6fed35] [^a09ba34c] [^fce98ae2] [^77d78b8b].

> I should double-check agents to avoid so I don't inadvertently recommend something harmful or ineffective. AASM recommends against diphenhydramine, tiagabine, tryptophan, and valerian for primary insomnia due to lack of efficacy and/or safety concerns; I need to ensure I communicate this clearly, especially given frequent OTC use of antihistamines and herbal products [^b7b6ea30] [^343b3cf3] [^ca34552b] [^0a1fa42d].

> Now, special populations require extra caution, so let me think about older adults and safety. In patients aged 60 and over, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs increase risks of cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle accidents; AASM and geriatric guidance advise avoiding benzodiazepines and limiting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, with routine reassessment; I should confirm that any ongoing hypnotic use beyond 3 months is exceptional and justified by clear benefit [^29aee3dd] [^980ec8bd] [^630fd435].

> But wait, what about duration of therapy and deprescribing? I initially thought "never use beyond 3 months", but I should correct that to "avoid routine long-term use" and reserve chronic pharmacotherapy for carefully selected patients after CBT-I failure, with shared decision-making and periodic attempts to taper; real-world data show high rates of inappropriate prolonged use, reinforcing the need for planned discontinuation trials and close follow-up [^630fd435] [^38be3c2a].

> I need to ensure I reconcile differing guideline perspectives so recommendations are balanced. ACP emphasizes CBT-I first and views pharmacotherapy as a short-term, second-line option with uncertain long-term benefit, whereas AASM provides weak recommendations for specific agents without endorsing one over another; European guidance allows more flexibility for selected patients, including intermittent or longer-term hypnotic or antidepressant use after individualized risk–benefit discussion, so I should tailor to patient values, comorbidities, and access to behavioral care [^d1ef4a8e] [^32ca4790] [^5cdea689] [^fce98ae2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and verify it aligns with evidence. Start with CBT-I whenever feasible; if medication is needed, match the drug to the predominant symptom (sleep onset vs maintenance), prefer shorter-acting agents, begin at the lowest effective dose, limit to short courses with predefined endpoints, and reassess frequently; consider suvorexant for maintenance, eszopiclone or zolpidem for onset/maintenance, zaleplon for onset only, and reserve benzodiazepines like temazepam or triazolam for short-term rescue given higher risk; avoid melatonin for primary insomnia, trazodone, antihistamines, and unproven supplements; in older adults, avoid benzodiazepines and use the lowest effective nonbenzodiazepine dose with explicit fall-risk counseling [^d1ef4a8e] [^32ca4790] [^630fd435] [^980ec8bd].

> Hold on, I should verify the key uncertainties so counseling is honest. Long-term efficacy and safety of hypnotics remain uncertain, most trials are short and industry-sponsored, head-to-head comparisons are sparse, and optimal sequencing of CBT-I with medication is still being refined; recent randomized data suggest comparable short-term daytime functional gains with behavioral therapy versus zolpidem, but durability favors behavioral approaches, which supports minimizing chronic hypnotic exposure and prioritizing CBT-I access and delivery innovations [^8280c532] [^4b16398c] [^f298aefb].

> Finally, I should confirm pediatric and pregnancy considerations so I don't overgeneralize adult guidance. No medications are FDA-approved for pediatric insomnia, and management should be behavioral-first with any pharmacotherapy individualized and off-label; similarly, pregnancy-specific safety data are limited, so nonpharmacologic strategies are preferred, and if medication is unavoidable, choose agents with the most favorable reproductive safety profile and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with shared decision-making [^ddb2eba1] [^notfound].

## Emerging treatments and future directions

Emerging treatments include **dual orexin receptor antagonists** (e.g. lemborexant, daridorexant), which show promise for both sleep onset and maintenance insomnia with favorable safety profiles [^01632f9d] [^2dabe99e]. Digital therapeutics, such as app-based CBT-I, are expanding access to nonpharmacologic care [^f298aefb]. Personalized medicine approaches aim to tailor treatment based on genetic, demographic, and clinical factors to optimize outcomes [^f5f75614].

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^32ca4790]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^ebfbd19e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Insomnia — methodologic priorities and overarching conclusions emphasize standardized statistical analysis and data presentation with means ± SD for sleep outcomes, with transformations for non-normally distributed variables and efforts to report means and SD across studies. Beyond individual sleep variables, achieving remission of chronic insomnia disorder should be considered as a clinically relevant outcome for pharmacological trials. The document urges to encourage funding for independent, non-industry investigation of the efficacy and effectiveness of hypnotic medications, notes that adverse event data are not collected and analyzed in standard ways with a need to standardize the assessment of adverse effects data, and highlights daytime safety by recognizing potential risk of motor vehicle or occupational accidents and that further efforts to include objective assessments of performance impairments which may be associated with daytime sedation is encouraged. Pediatric evidence is limited despite use, as virtually no data exists regarding the use of sleep-promoting agents in children and adolescents and such medications are not infrequently used in this age group. The summary states it relies heavily on rigorous evaluation of the quality of evidence for efficacy, based on GRADE and that foundational data are sorely limited, concluding that many commonly used drugs, including some which carry FDA approval for treatment of insomnia, are not recommended, and advising clinicians to continue to exercise sound clinical judgment considering experience, prior response, preferences, and adverse effects.

Guideline recommendation scope and strength — these analyses yield recommendations for use of a limited number of drugs for a limited number of specific indications such as sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, and in all cases the recommendations are "weak", based on relatively limited and/or low quality evidence; many agents shown to be "statistically significantly superior" to placebo may nonetheless be "not recommended", reflecting differences between FDA criteria and the GRADE approach, which establishes evidence quality ratings and clinical significance thresholds not used in individual studies or FDA approval, and each prescriber bears responsibility for treatment determinations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^aa41c214]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep-promoting medications — evidence limitations and research needs — are characterized by overall quality of evidence that is relatively low in the vast majority of cases, with insufficient evidence for numerous drugs and highly variable, idiosyncratic data reporting that precludes comparing data from one study to another or conducting meta-analyses; virtually all studies of prescription hypnotic agents are industry-funded, and potential publication bias, particularly lack of publication of negative results, and the role of industry in study design and data analysis may compromise evidence quality and uniformity; with these limitations, the task force recommends for future investigations: clear definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequately powering studies to detect significant differences for key sleep variables, and development and utilization of uniform data collection instruments to improve cross-study analysis and comparisons.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^b6dea782]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) chronic insomnia pharmacologic guideline — introduction and scope — states that the paper includes a systematic review and meta-analyses forming the basis of the initial guideline and is intended to serve as one component in an ongoing assessment, providing recommendations regarding specific insomnia drugs once the decision has been made to use pharmacotherapy and not recommending one drug over another. Cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I) are identified as a standard of treatment and such treatment carries a significantly favorable benefit: risk ratio; therefore, based on these guidelines, all patients with chronic insomnia should receive CBT-I as a primary intervention. Pharmacotherapy, alone or in combination with CBT-I, must continue to be considered a part of the therapeutic armamentarium, as it currently is for perhaps 25% of the population, though only an estimated 3.5% to 7% of individuals receive prescription medication for sleep disturbance and knowledge gaps among prescribers exist regarding proper usage.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) insomnia guideline — interpretation and strength: The following clinical practice recommendations are based on the systematic review and evaluation of evidence following the GRADE methodology. Readers will note that all specific recommendations fall within the "weak" (for or against) classification of the GRADE system.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia: past, present, and future [^c21e4cc4]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Views on the etiology and morbidities associated with insomnia are evolving and affect clinicians' approach to the pharmacologic management of insomnia. Currently, benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and a single melatonin receptor agonist are recognized as safe and efficacious hypnotics. Variability in BzRAs, pharmacokinetics, and manipulation of dose provide clinicians with options that meet the needs of most patients. Other drugs (eg, sedating antidepressants) also are used commonly in clinical practice to treat insomnia, but evidence is lacking to support this most cases. Improvement in managing insomnia will result from systematic research with these drugs, with drugs in development, and with novel uses, such as co-therapy.

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^f5f75614]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care in an attempt to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to that of a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward this personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with mechanism of action.

### Pharmacological management of insomnia [^56ef86c7]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition associated with significant morbidity, reduction in quality of life, and increase in healthcare costs, and is a risk factor for multiple physical and mental disorders. The primary treatment modality is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) but this is associated with difficulties with access and higher cost as well as poor response in some patients. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia is common and hypnotic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Older medications for insomnia are limited by their side effect burden and narrow therapeutic window. Newer hypnotics, on the other hand, have been shown to have a better safety profile and longer term efficacy. While some studies have shown that long-term hypnotic use is associated with adverse outcomes, the current evidence is equivocal. The decision to treat chronic insomnia disorder with long-term hypnotics should be individualized and balance the potential risks of continuing hypnotic medication use with the risks of untreated persistent insomnia and associated functional limitations. This clinical review discusses the currently available medication options to treat insomnia, their mechanisms of action, dosing, and side effect profiles. This review also provides guidance on long-term management of hypnotics and the use of these medications in the elderly, those with medical comorbidities, and other special populations.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia? [^bf38d9f9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves. Here we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d1ef4a8e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^c9bd766e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians 2016 guideline — management of chronic insomnia states that "all patients with chronic insomnia receive CBT-I as the initial treatment intervention. This is a strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence", and that "a shared decision-making approach can be employed by clinicians in determining whether pharmacotherapy should be employed for those patients who did not achieve adequate response with CBT-I (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence)". It further notes "insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the overall efficacy of pharmacotherapy", "insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines, trazodone and melatonin", that "there were no specific recommendations made for single agents", and "insufficient evidence found to determine the balance of benefits versus harms".

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^e0294aa7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

Chronic insomnia pharmacologic treatment in adults — comparative efficacy and scope — notes that hypnotic medications are comparably efficacious to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during acute treatment, but the gains associated with CBT-I are durable following completion of treatment, whereas those associated with medication tend to dissipate following discontinuation; most investigations address relatively short-term use (e.g. one day to five weeks), and chronic use should be reserved for those individuals for whom CBT is either inaccessible or ineffective, who have been appropriately screened for contraindications, who maintain long-term gains with medication, and who are followed regularly; findings presented in this report apply only to adults, as none of the agents discussed are approved for use in children and none of the findings presented apply to children or adolescents.

### Advances in the management of chronic insomnia [^07c6873a]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Chronic insomnia is a common condition that affects people worldwide and has negative effects on patients' health and wellbeing. The treatment of insomnia can be complex and time consuming for patients and providers. Although behavioral interventions are the first line therapy, there are barriers to access for these treatments. However, in recent years, alternative ways of providing these behavioral therapies that make them more widely available have been investigated. Drugs also play an important role in the treatment of insomnia and new drugs have been introduced as options for treating patients with sleep initiation and sleep maintenance insomnia. In this review, we will discuss advances in the past six years in both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for patients with chronic insomnia. We will also review the controversies surrounding some of the current drug treatments, as well as the role that technology and personal activity monitoring devices may play in treating insomnia.

### Insomnia [^a9f76275]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Insomnia is one of the most prevalent health concerns in the population and in clinical practice. Clinicians may be reluctant to address insomnia because of its many potential causes, unfamiliarity with behavioral treatments, and concerns about pharmacologic treatments.

Objective

To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in adults.

Evidence Review

Systematic review to identify and summarize previously published quantitative reviews (meta-analyses) of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for insomnia.

Findings

Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.

Conclusions and Relevance

Clinicians should recognize insomnia because of its effects on function and health. A thorough clinical history is often sufficient to identify factors that contribute to insomnia. Behavioral treatments should be used when possible. Hypnotic medications are also efficacious but must be carefully monitored for adverse effects.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I2 cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^ccf094a3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Approach and interpretation of recommendations — direction, strength, public comment, and definitions indicate that the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (STRONG or WEAK) for each recommendation statement. Public input was solicited for a two-week period on the AASM website, and based on comments the task force decided to include data from clinicaltrials.gov, which allowed development of a recommendation for the use of suvorexant; due to a conflict of interest, a task force member did not participate in that recommendation. The guideline states it should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other reasonable methods, defines a STRONG recommendation as one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, always be following when pharmacological treatment is indicated, and states that a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in appropriateness and requires that the clinician use his/her clinical knowledge and experience and refer to the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### A retrospective observational study to understand medication utilization and lines of treatment in patients with insomnia disorder [^38be3c2a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, associated with multiple health concerns. Current medications for insomnia are associated with higher safety risks if clinical practice guidelines or monograph recommendations are not followed. This study aims to understand real-world prescribing practices among patients with insomnia in Canada, including medication utilization, potentially inappropriate medication use, cost incurred, and lines of treatment.

Methods: This retrospective observational study utilized longitudinal drug claims data from 2018 to 2020 from the Canadian IQVIA National Private Drug Plan and Ontario Drug Benefit databases. Patients with any claims for medications approved for insomnia in Canada were identified. Four types of inappropriate medication usage were defined: (1) elevated daily dose; (2) extended duration of use for benzodiazepines (BZD) and/or Z-drugs; (3) combination use; and (4) opioid overlap with BZD and/or Z-drugs.

Results: In 2019, 597,222 patients with insomnia were identified; 64% were female, with an average age of 55 years. Inappropriate medication use was noted in 52.5% of adult patients (aged 18–65 years) and 69.5% of senior patients (aged > 65 years). Extended duration was the most common inappropriate medication usage category. The annual cost of medications for insomnia was $54.8 million, and $30.3 million (55.2%) met inappropriate medication use criteria.

Conclusion: High prevalence of inappropriate medications usage in insomnia raises serious safety concerns for patients suffering from insomnia, particularly seniors, while also placing a substantial burden on the Canadian public and private health systems. This highlights an unmet need for better education regarding current guidelines and more effective and safer treatment options.

### Pharmacologic approach to insomnia [^8b2ce693]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep management is essential to effective treatment of pain symptoms. Identification of the precise nature of sleep complaint, awareness of patient's age and co-morbid conditions and choice of the hypnotic medication class can help guide treatment approach. In addition to benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine medications acting at the GABA receptor, novel approaches, including orexin receptor agonists, may be safer and more promising pharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic interventions, when used cautiously for a limited period of time and in complement with behavioral and cognitive approaches, can serve to improve sleep quality and significantly help in management of pain.

### Current, emerging, and newly available insomnia medications [^c281463d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Research into the sleep-wake cycle has provided new treatment targets for patients with insomnia as well as a better understanding of how medications affect sleep processes. Current insomnia medications, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, focus on enhancing sleep-promoting systems through broad antagonism of GABA. Other medications that promote sleep by blocking wake-promoting systems include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, but adverse effects and nonspecific therapeutic effects limit their use. New and emerging insomnia medications are focusing on blocking wake-promoting systems via more selective antagonism of orexin, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These medications may offer improved efficacy with fewer adverse effects.

### Antidepressants for insomnia in adults [^a09ba34c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep (e.g. sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, impairment of daytime functioning). Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.

Search Methods

This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia and all participant types including people with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose whether compared with placebo, other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs), a different antidepressant, waiting list control or treatment as usual.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data using a data extraction form. A third review author resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction.

Main Results

The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality evidence). There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency (mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27 minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence)'. ther' antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence). There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased dry mouth and thirst).

Authors' Conclusions

We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice) or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia. High-quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed.

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^2dabe99e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Study Selection

35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia, fractures, and major injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies had risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other adverse effects, and they advised dose reduction in women and in older adults.

Limitations

Most trials were small and short term and enrolled individuals meeting stringent criteria. Minimum important differences in outcomes were often not established or reported. Data were scant for many treatments.

Conclusion

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term global and sleep outcomes for adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are not known. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia may cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with infrequent but serious harms.

### Insomnia [^f298aefb]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Insomnia is highly prevalent in clinical practice, occurring in up to 50% of primary care patients. Insomnia can present independently or alongside other medical conditions or mental health disorders and is a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of these other disorders if not treated. In 2016, the American College of Physicians recommended that insomnia be specifically targeted for treatment. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, whether the underlying cause has been identified or not, is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Currently, there is no global consensus regarding which pharmacological treatment has the best efficacy or risk-benefit ratio. Both CBT-I and pharmacological intervention are thought to have similar acute effects, but only CBT-I has shown durable long-term effects after treatment discontinuation. Administering a combined treatment of CBT-I and medication could decrease the latency to treatment response, but might diminish the durability of the positive treatment effects of CBT-I.

### The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: rational approaches. A consensus meeting summary [^cbe8829a]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To formulate a rational approach to the pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia, and to develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for the use of these medications, especially by community-based pediatricians.

Participants

A multidisciplinary task force developed under the auspices of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which included experts in pediatric sleep medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and general pediatrics.

Evidence

Review of existing data regarding current use of over-the-counter and prescription medications for pediatric insomnia in the primary care practice setting, and of empirical data on the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications commonly used for the treatment of pediatric insomnia.

Consensus Process

Group consensus definition of pediatric insomnia and clinical guidelines; working group recommendations regarding special populations and future directions.

Conclusions

Use of medications for pediatric insomnia should be diagnostically driven, and should be implemented in conjunction with empirically-based behavioral treatment strategies and adequate sleep hygiene. Specific target populations include children with neurodevelopmental disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, chronic medical conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Additional research, including clinical trials, is critically needed to provide an evidence-based approach to the use of these medications in clinical practice.

### Diagnosing and treating insomnia in adults and older adults [^4c1cccec]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep-wake disorder, affects 6% to 10% of adults. It may result in interpersonal and occupational problems and has a deleterious effect on quality of life. Patients may experience difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, or both. Insomnia disorder is commonly comorbid with psychiatric, medical, and neurologic disorders, and insomnia and comorbid conditions have bidirectional relationships. Diagnosis should be based on patient interview, assessment with tools, and use of criteria. Selection of treatment for patients with insomnia should factor in efficacy for the patient's specific complaint as well as other features such as safety profile and abuse liability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is a first-line recommendation by guidelines, but some patients are unable or unwilling to try it or may not respond to it. Older adults with insomnia disorder require careful consideration of medications' risk-benefit profiles.

### Therapeutic options in the treatment of insomnia [^f9276844]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies both have roles in the treatment of insomnia. The benzodiazepines, when first introduced, were a major improvement over earlier treatments for insomnia in terms of their safety and efficacy. Since then, the nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists have been developed, which have provided advantages over the older medications and are currently first-line medication treatment for insomnia. Although antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are often prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, they are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication and have side effects that are sometimes severe. New types of medications that have different modes of action from the benzodiazepine receptor agonists are now being developed, and one, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, has recently been approved for treatment of insomnia. Nonpharmacologic therapies can also help patients learn how to fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality. It is important for physicians to teach patients good sleep hygiene as part of their treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in the treatment of insomnia, alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy, but finding a qualified provider can be difficult and the patient must be willing to take the time to learn the therapies and wait for them to show effect.

### Pharmacologic agents effective in treating chronic insomnia… [^db859c71]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Background: Chronic insomnia affects between 9 and 12 percent of U. S. adults and can impair mental health and quality of life. Pharmacologic treatments include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. The only insomnia medication that is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for long-term usage is the non-benzodiazepine eszopiclone. Only one previous meta-analysis has evaluated these agents in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Buscemi and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness and safety of these treatments in the management of chronic insomnia in adults. Results: The review included 105 trials, mostly short-term studies, in patients with insomnia lasting between 1. 1 months and
17. 7 years. The combined weighted mean difference, measured polygraphically, showed a significant reduction in sleep latency for medications compared with placebo. The WMD for benzodiazepines was −10.

0 minutes; for non-benzodiazepines, −12. 8 minutes; and for antidepressants, −7. 0 minutes. The sleep latency reduction results for sleep diary were more prominent in favoring medication over placebo. For other sleep quality parameters, statistically significant results generally favored benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines. In antidepressant studies, only polysomnography measurements favored antidepressants; sleep diary measurements gave nonsignificant results favoring antidepressants or placebo, depending on the outcome. Conclusion: Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines are effective in treating chronic insomnia. Indirect comparison suggested a greater safety profile for non-benzodiazepines. Antidepressants also appear to be effective, although studies are lacking.

The findings are limited by the short-term nature of the studies and the publication bias likely associated with the private funding of many benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine studies. Further research is needed to study the effects of these medications on daytime functioning and their use by vulnerable groups, such as older adults.

### Secondary insomnia: diagnostic challenges and intervention opportunities [^c4109cea]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The assessment and treatment of secondary insomnia (SI), the most common form of insomnia, are often complicated. Establishing an accompanying disorder as causal rather than comorbid is the key to assessment, but can be difficult even for experienced clinicians. Treatment often focuses on the primary disorder. In many cases, however, there is reason to treat the insomnia directly (insomnia is partially independent, does not respond to treatment of the primary condition, or has been misdiagnosed as SI). Although hypnotic medications are frequently used, behavioral interventions may be the best treatment approach, providing better long-term management of symptoms. Older adults warrant special consideration as age-related illnesses, changes in drug absorption and metabolism, and polypharmacy make them especially susceptible to SI. Recent research suggests successful treatment of insomnia may also relieve the primary disorder and merits follow-up. Future research is also needed on the efficacy of psychological treatment for SI for specific disorders as well as for older adults.

### Insomnia [^688c2c49]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia-the unwelcome experience of difficulty sleeping-is common and can be acute, intermittent, or chronic. Insomnia can be the presenting symptom for several common sleep disorders, but it also often occurs comorbidly with mental and physical health conditions. Evaluating the symptom of insomnia requires assessing-largely by history-whether an underlying condition explains it. Insomnia disorder is the diagnostic term for the symptom of insomnia that merits specific attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the preferred treatment approach because of its efficacy, safety, and durability of benefit, but pharmaceutical treatments are widely used for insomnia symptoms.

### Future directions in the management of insomnia [^905c3550]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Research on insomnia has provided a number of important new insights, but fundamental deficits in our understanding remain. In considering priorities for future research, 3 areas warrant immediate attention. First, a causal relationship between insomnia and the adverse outcomes seen in insomnia patients needs to be established. Second, currently available symptomatic therapies need to be optimized. Recent data suggest that some benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce their hypnotic effect without side effects that were presumed to be inherent to sedation. Understanding the neuropharmacology underlying this differential effect would allow substantial improvements in the risk-benefit ratio for these drugs. Finally, the mechanisms of insomnia need to be better understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologic arousal is important to the clinical presentation of primary insomnia. It remains unclear, however, whether this activation is primary or secondary to the insomnia itself. If physiologic hyperarousal causes primary insomnia, it would provide new approaches to the management of this disorder.

Ramelteon for the treatment of chronic insomnia — recommendation and evidence appraisal: We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK] Four RCTs investigated ramelteon; the overall quality of evidence was downgraded to very low due to substantial heterogeneity, imprecision, and potential publication bias. The overall evidence was weakly in favor of effectiveness for sleep onset disturbance only, with minimal increase in PSG-determined total sleep time well below the threshold for clinical significance, and measures of sleep efficiency and sleep quality showed no clinically significant improvement. There was no evidence of significant difference from placebo for any adverse events, and based on clinical judgement the task force determined that the majority of well-informed patients would use ramelteon over no treatment.

### The assessment and management of insomnia: an update [^4cb84ee5]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, psychiatric and physical morbidity, and accidents. As such, it is important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. To this end, this paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options. These options include both non-medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, "z-drugs", melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non-selective antihistamines. A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are an array of interventions which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with the above features, and whose risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized. These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence-based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, with the aim of providing a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.

### Pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia [^675102c0]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pediatric insomnia is common in children and adolescents, particularly in children who have comorbid medical, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, and may be associated with cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial impairments that often result in significant caregiver burden. Although several behavioral interventions for pediatric insomnia are effective, there is a relative paucity of empiric evidence supporting the use of pharmacologic treatment. Sedative/hypnotic drugs are frequently used in clinical practice to treat pediatric insomnia, and guidelines for the use of these medications in general as well as for specific medications have been developed. This review presents expert consensus guidelines for the use of these medications in clinical practice, with a focus on the different classes of pharmacologic agents that are most commonly prescribed.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia [^211d8cbe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for many types of insomnia, most notably transient insomnia associated with stress, acute illness, or jet lag. Many patients with chronic insomnia, including primary insomnia and insomnia secondary to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders, also benefit from pharmacotherapy. Relatively few individuals receive prescription medication to help them sleep, and the majority use medication for a few nights to several weeks, as opposed to continuous use for months or years. The hypnotics available on the U.S. market today are benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). The BZRAs are efficacious in reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, reducing awakenings, and improving sleep quality without the development of tolerance in studies as long as 6 months. Side effects of the BZRAs are infrequent, dose-related, and related to the sedative properties of the drug. Sedating antidepressants are also frequently prescribed to promote sleep despite inadequate data to support their efficacy for this indication and a greater potential for clinically troublesome side effects.

This article describes the circumstances under which women may develop insomnia and the various treatment options, including hypnotic medication and nonpharmacologic approaches. The efficacy and safety of these treatments are reviewed. The choice of treatment depends on the nature of the insomnia, the stage of a woman's life, the presence of medical or mental health conditions, the availability of treatments, and personal preference. For immediate, short-term relief of acute insomnia, hypnotic medication, especially the nonbenzodiazepines (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone) are options. For chronic insomnia, insomnia-specific cognitive and behavioral therapies are generally the interventions of choice.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^4b16398c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which first-stage treatment is optimal for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia, and which second-stage treatment offers the best added value for patients whose insomnia has not remitted?

Findings

In a randomized clinical trial of 211 adults with insomnia disorder, first-stage treatment with behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem produced significant improvements for various daytime outcomes, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, functional impairments, and mental health, that were no different between groups. Adding a second-stage therapy offered an added value for further improving daytime functions with immediate and delayed effects observed for treatment sequences starting with zolpidem and BT, respectively.

Meaning

These findings support the comparable efficacy between sequential treatments starting with BT and zolpidem for addressing the daytime consequences of insomnia.

Many psychiatric patients have significant sleep disturbance. Insomnia should be addressed directly even when comorbid with a psychiatric disorder. Nonpharmacologic treatments are effective and especially well suited for long-term management of sleep problems. Although the techniques themselves are fairly straightforward, they work best when applied with the kind of clinical insight and experience that psychiatrists regularly draw on in their practices. This article briefly reviews the evaluation of insomnia, with the aim of eliciting clinical material sufficiently comprehensive to inform the choice of treatment, and provides a practical overview of the basic nondrug approaches to insomnia, emphasizing what the clinician and the patient may expect from their application.

### A compendium of placebo-controlled trials of the risks / benefits of pharmacological treatments for insomnia: the empirical basis for U.S. clinical practice [^b31f0a9f]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

For many years practitioners have had limited data from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to guide the types of decision-making needed to optimally manage patients with insomnia in clinical practice. However, in recent years there has been a great increase in insomnia research studies that address issues of clinical importance. This body of work represents an increasingly useful empirical basis for making clinical practice decisions. The purpose of this article is to compile the body of work on the pharmacological management of insomnia to make it available in as accessible form as possible for optimal application in clinical practice with the hopes that doing so will decrease the gap separating the available research and the clinical management of insomnia and, thereby, improve the care of the many individuals who suffer from this condition. The review of studies consists of the following sections: 1) basic pharmacology; 2) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with primary insomnia; 3) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with primary insomnia; 4) adverse effects reported in placebo-controlled trials in elderly primary insomnia patients; 5) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and the elderly as a function of treatment duration; 6) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of the treatment of comorbid insomnia. Issues related to the application of these data to clinical practice are discussed in the text.

### Hypnotic medication in the treatment of chronic insomnia: non nocere! doesn' T anyone care? [^dd82c8b2]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2000). Low credibility.

Chronic primary insomnia is a recurrent condition that negatively effects the daily functioning of patients, diminishing the quality of their lives. It is associated with, and in some situations, is a risk factor in both psychiatric (depression) and physical (cardiovascular) illness. Treatment effectiveness has been shown in the short term for both drug (benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine agonists) and behavioral treatment. Expert opinion has strongly advised against long-term drug treatment because of concerns about residual sedative effects, memory impairment, falls, respiratory depression, rebound insomnia, medication abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal difficulties, and an increased risk of death possibly associated with the current hypnotic medications. Many of these concerns could be made against using these agents at all. Worries about these potential problems are challenged by the widespread clinical practice of using hypnotic drugs long-term without any of these difficulties developing and with patients who feel their sleep and daily function function is improved with the nightly use of their sleeping pill. The ability to mount a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind trial of hypnotic medication in primary insomnia may not be possible. We may have to develop large systematic clinical databases, a number of case series in effect, to monitor both emergent symptoms and possible clinical effectiveness. There is the additional concern that there is a reluctance to examine the long-term drug treatment of insomnia. This reluctance may reflect a negative moral judgement about treating primary insomnia with drugs, a sort of < < < < pharmacological Calvinism > > > >, rather than just a data based judiciousness.

### Effect of psychological and medication therapies for insomnia on daytime functions: a randomized clinical trial [^2710e96d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that tends to be persistent or recurrent, and can produce a significant burden on the individual and society. Insomnia is a 24-hour disorder that consists not only of nocturnal symptoms (ie, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but also daytime symptoms. As one of the key components for insomnia diagnosis, daytime functional impairments such as fatigue and mood disturbances are often the primary reasons for patients with insomnia to seek treatment, indicating the necessity of addressing daytime consequences of insomnia.

Current recommended treatments for insomnia in clinical practice guidelines include 2 major approaches: psychological therapies (ie, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and medications (eg, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants). Although medications are more frequently used in clinical practice mostly because they are more easily accessible, few data exist about the efficacy of sleep-promoting medications for improving daytime functions. With regard to CBT, the main outcomes are related to improving sleep continuity and insomnia severity, yet some evidence also suggests that it may be effective in improving various daytime symptoms, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and quality of life, among insomnia patients and those with comorbid depressive disorder. However, the effects of CBT on daytime symptoms are predominantly small to moderate, as revealed by a recent meta-analysis.

### Combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for insomnia [^44bb6693]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Although both clinical experience and formal studies confirm the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and hypnotic medications as treatments for insomnia, the interaction of the 2 treatments when combined has not been fully clarified. In principle, they could potentiate each other, not interact at all (in which case the benefits would be the sum of the 2 treatments alone), or inhibit each other. In this review, I suggest that the weight of available evidence indicates that the 2 treatments have a beneficial interaction, but that the paucity of data should prevent excessive generalization. It would be desirable for future studies to employ newer hypnotics with a range of doses in both nightly and p.r.n. administration and to examine comorbid as well as primary insomnias. The manner in which the medication is presented to the patient and the caregiver's conviction regarding the effectiveness of therapy need to be carefully controlled. Studies that consider these issues will need to be performed before firmer conclusions can be reached.

### Recent developments in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia [^ec0a2e07]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep/wake complaints, and specifically insomnia, are some of the more common problems encountered in the outpatient setting. Despite its prevalence, few clinicians are experts at diagnosing and treating this entity. Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a time-intensive process (often the initial interview takes at least 1 h, depending on the complexity of the insomnia). With a conservative estimate of the annual cost of insomnia between dollar 92.5 and dollar 107.5 billion dollars, it is becoming clear that insomnia has significant medical and public health implications. A problem that has hampered insomnia research is the lack of a standard definition of insomnia for use in research, as well as guidelines for assessment. In recent years, there have been important advances in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia with efforts to establish greater consensus in how to define and measure insomnia. Cognitive behavioral and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective treatment approaches. Insomnia is a complex entity, often multifactorial in its etiology; and as research and clinical guidelines are established and validated (leading to better data interpretation), continued enhancement of our understanding of this disorder is expected.

Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and other hypnotics — geriatric cautions, adverse effects, and mitigation — are described as having pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences among older and younger adults, necessitating lower starting dosages; the American Geriatric Society Beers criteria recommend that benzodiazepines be avoided for treatment of insomnia in older patients and further recommend that newer generation benzodiazepine receptor agonists be limited to shorter-term use (< 90 days); adverse effect data do not suggest a high frequency of serious side effects but are scant and inconsistent, warranting caution, with reported adverse effects including dependency/withdrawal, cognitive impairment, falls/fractures, parasomnias, and driving impairment and motor vehicle accidents; complications are observed most frequently in older populations, with risks clearly increased in the elderly, at dosages in excess of those recommended, or when combined with other psychoactive agents; sedation-related complications are most likely with longer-acting agents and during morning hours following bedtime administration, and use of shorter-acting agents and the lowest effective dosage may help to reduce these complications; complete avoidance may be appropriate in select patients, particularly those with severe sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia, in whom use has been associated with respiratory suppression.

### The pharmacologic management of insomnia in patients with HIV [^a81d5a8d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Insomnia is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive populations. Some studies have estimated as many as 70% of HIV patients experience insomnia at some point during their illness. Insomnia has been linked to reduced quality of life as well as treatment non-adherence in these patients. However, there has been very limited research on the treatment of insomnia in this setting. Lacking treatment trials, we carried out a review of the available literature relevant to the pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in HIV seropositive individuals in order to provide guidance for the clinical management of this complex population. A systematic MEDLINE search was performed using as search terms each of the FDA approved or commonly prescribed insomnia medications and "insomnia and HIV". In addition, we reviewed the published literature on HIV therapies and common comorbid conditions and their interactions with insomnia therapies. We found 4 primary factors affecting the pharmacotherapy of insomnia in individuals with HIV: (1) medications used to treat HIV; (2) antibiotics used to treat opportunistic infections; (3) the HIV infection itself; and (4) conditions frequently associated with HIV infection. The means by which these factors affect the expected risk-benefit profile of insomnia therapies is discussed, and recommendations are made for choosing medications in patients encountered in clinical practice.

Current hypnotic usage — prescription patterns and population use are summarized across U.S. datasets. Overall frequency of hypnotic prescriptions for insomnia declined during 1970–1990 from 5.3% to 2.5%. In office-based prescribing during 1987–1996, there was an over 50% decline in benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic prescriptions accompanied by a nearly 150% increase in trazodone prescriptions, and overall prescriptions for insomnia declined by about 25% during this period. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2010 data, just under 3% of the population had used these agents within the past month; BzRAs were most commonly prescribed (1.23% of the population), followed by trazodone (0.97%), BZDs (0.4%), quetiapine (0.32%) and doxepin. The use of antidepressants with poor or limited documentation was only 0.7% in the past month, increasing from 0.2% in the first year sampled to 3.5% in the final year (2009–2010). The 2005 National Sleep Foundation's survey found that 7% of respondents report using a prescription medication to improve sleep at least a few nights per month.

Zaleplon trials — study scope and dosing considerations include "Evidence from two RCTs which investigated the use of zaleplon 5 or 10 mg in the treatment of chronic primary insomnia was included in the main analysis of outcomes", with designs that "included randomized, double-blind, placebo run-in with zaleplon 5–20 mg or placebo for 14–35 nights, followed by a 7–14 night placebo substitution". The document specifies that "Data for zaleplon 20 mg were not considered here because this is not an FDA-approved dose", and that "The overall quality of evidence from these studies was downgraded to low due to imprecision and potential publication bias; both studies were industry supported".
