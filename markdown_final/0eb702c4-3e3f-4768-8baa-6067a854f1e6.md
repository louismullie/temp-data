## Question

Is it appropriate to administer Jardiance in the setting of AKI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Jardiance (empagliflozin) is appropriate in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios of initiating during active AKI versus continuing when AKI occurs on therapy. Then, I should verify what the FDA label and major guidelines actually say. Next, I will examine the evidence base about AKI risk and the early eGFR "dip" with SGLT2 inhibitors. After that, I need to consider data from acute settings and hemodynamic safety. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations on withholding, re‑starting, and monitoring after AKI resolution, making sure I reconcile any apparent contradictions as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing. I should distinguish starting empagliflozin de novo during an episode of active AKI from the decision to continue or pause it when a patient on therapy develops AKI, because the risk-benefit calculus and evidence base differ in these two situations. I also need to remember that SGLT2 inhibitors cause an expected, typically small, hemodynamic fall in eGFR after initiation that is not due to tubular injury, which could easily be confused with worsening AKI if I don't check the context and trajectory carefully [^115h2ND8].

> Next, I should review the FDA label with precision. Empagliflozin carries indications for T2D, HF, and CKD; for glycemic control alone it is not recommended if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and for CKD risk reduction it is supported down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m². The label highlights early reversible increases in creatinine and declines in eGFR, warns about intravascular volume depletion, and advises withholding during temporary clinical situations predisposing to ketoacidosis with resumption once clinically stable with oral intake. Wait, I initially thought the FDA explicitly contraindicated use in "active AKI", but hold on, that specific phrase is not in the label; instead, the label emphasizes volume depletion risk, transient creatinine changes, and temporary withholding during acute illness, with no affirmative indication to start during AKI either. I should be careful not to overstate a contraindication that the label doesn't actually make while still respecting the caution it clearly provides in acute-illness states and in those at risk of hemodynamic compromise [^115wqfkX] [^117NHFcY] [^113Lbc3c] [^114mmSiF].

> Now, I will examine the evolution of evidence regarding AKI risk. Early pharmacovigilance raised concerns, but meta-analyses of large cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials, as well as real‑world cohorts, consistently show reduced AKI risk with SGLT2 inhibitors relative to placebo or other agents. Mechanistically, the initial eGFR dip reflects restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback and reduced intraglomerular pressure, not structural nephrotoxicity, and it reverses upon discontinuation. Hold on, I should confirm that this risk reduction is seen specifically with empagliflozin; yes, EMPA-REG renal analyses align with class effects, and pooled data suggest a class-wide AKI risk reduction signal, with empagliflozin contributory in subgroup assessments [^111ohiNz] [^114xGfzL] [^116GQcvS] [^115h2ND8] [^116BsyB6].

> But wait, what about acute settings that are "borderline AKI" contexts? Let me consider trials around acute MI and procedures. In EMPACT‑MI, starting empagliflozin soon after MI produced an early eGFR pattern similar to placebo, with recovery and longer‑term kidney protection signals; in SAFE‑PCI, peri‑procedural empagliflozin did not increase contrast‑associated AKI in stable elective PCI. However, I need to double‑check generalizability to critically ill AKI: the DEFENDER trial in unplanned ICU admissions with acute organ dysfunction showed no benefit (and no major harm signal), but the population and agent (dapagliflozin) differ, and the study was underpowered for kidney endpoints. So, in unstable critical illness or evolving AKI, the evidence does not support routine initiation, whereas in stabilized post‑MI or elective settings, safety looks acceptable with careful selection and monitoring [^1158GshT] [^116dTxPJ] [^1141kqg9] [^116aJ2ML].

> Next, I should review guidelines to anchor practice. The UK Kidney Association explicitly recommends temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness and cautions that early eGFR declines after initiation should not trigger knee‑jerk discontinuation when patients are otherwise stable. KDIGO 2024 endorses SGLT2i therapy for CKD down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² in stable patients, not those with active AKI, while ADA/EASD consensus places SGLT2 inhibitors as first‑line for T2D with CKD and does not let the possibility of AKI preclude appropriate use in stable CKD. European renal best practice statements emphasize reassessment after AKI resolution, reinforcing that the right timing is after stabilization rather than during the acute phase [^115nTXzm] [^114sKiVq] [^117XaRxc] [^11464j76].

> I need to ensure I frame safety correctly in the AKI context. The dominant hazard during active AKI is hemodynamic: osmotic diuresis and natriuresis can worsen effective volume and renal perfusion in hypovolemic or vasodilated states, and the anticipated hemodynamic eGFR drop can blur the clinical picture. The FDA label's cautions about volume depletion, transient creatinine rises, and temporary withholding during acute illness fit this physiology, so in a patient with AKI from hypovolemia, sepsis, or peri‑contrast instability, continuing an SGLT2 inhibitor risks aggravating perfusion mismatch until euvolemia and stability return [^114mmSiF] [^113Lbc3c].

> Pulling these threads together, my recommendation is to avoid initiating empagliflozin during active AKI. Let me reconsider whether there is any scenario where starting during AKI is advantageous; I don't see supportive trial evidence for initiation in the midst of AKI, and the potential for hemodynamic worsening plus interpretive confusion over creatinine changes argues against it. The balance clearly favors treating the AKI first, correcting volume status, stabilizing hemodynamics, and then reassessing candidacy for SGLT2 inhibition after recovery has begun or the AKI has resolved [^115nTXzm] [^114mmSiF].

> When AKI develops in someone already taking empagliflozin, I should double‑check for precipitating acute illness, diuretic intensification, hypotension, or poor intake, and then temporarily hold the SGLT2 inhibitor while addressing the cause. Wait, let me verify whether short interruptions blunt long‑term benefit; post‑trial data from EMPA‑KIDNEY suggest durable kidney benefits and safety that persist, supporting temporary withholding without forfeiting long‑term protection once therapy is resumed appropriately. Resumption makes sense when the patient is clinically stable, euvolemic, with improving creatinine and adequate oral intake [^1154sVsb] [^115nTXzm].

> After AKI resolution, initiating or re‑initiating empagliflozin is appropriate in eligible patients because of substantial cardiorenal benefits across CKD risk categories, including reductions in CKD progression and AKI events over time. I should confirm the eGFR threshold and dose: empagliflozin 10 mg daily is supported for CKD down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m², with no glycemic efficacy expected below 30 but with kidney and heart failure benefits retained. To reduce interpretive noise, I will check creatinine and volume status at baseline and again in about 1–2 weeks, anticipating a small, reversible eGFR fall; I should also consider adjusting loop diuretics if the patient is borderline volume depleted to avoid hypotension or prerenal physiology on restart [^116ZqBXG] [^112kjQJi] [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm].

> Finally, I should lay out red flags and monitoring to avoid missteps. If there is ongoing hypotension, active sepsis, or persistent oliguria, I will not restart yet. If ketoacidosis is suspected or oral intake is limited, I will continue to withhold until these resolve per the label. On restarting, I will counsel patients about sick‑day rules, volume depletion symptoms, genital/urinary infections, and when to pause the drug during future acute illnesses, and I will plan labs to document the expected hemodynamic dip rather than misclassifying it as recurrent AKI. If the creatinine rise exceeds what is expected from the class effect or the patient becomes symptomatic, I need to reassess volume, diuretic burden, and co‑medications and adjust accordingly [^114mmSiF] [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm].

> Bottom line, I should not initiate empagliflozin during active AKI, and I should temporarily withhold it when AKI develops on therapy, resuming only after clinical stabilization and improving kidney function; once recovered, starting or restarting is appropriate and beneficial in eligible CKD patients, with mindful monitoring of the expected early eGFR dip and vigilance for volume depletion and acute illness triggers [^115nTXzm] [^116ZqBXG] [^116BsyB6] [^111ohiNz] [^114mmSiF].

No — Jardiance (empagliflozin) **should not be initiated or continued** in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume depletion and hemodynamic effects that can cause or worsen AKI [^112GX1BU]. Current guidelines recommend **temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness or AKI** and resuming only after renal function has recovered and the patient is clinically stable [^115nTXzm]. If AKI develops while taking Jardiance, stop the drug immediately, correct volume status, and monitor renal function until recovery.

---

## Pharmacological considerations in AKI

Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2, increasing urinary glucose and sodium excretion and causing osmotic diuresis [^114mmSiF], volume depletion, and hemodynamic changes that **may precipitate or worsen AKI**, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those on diuretics [^112GX1BU] [^115h2ND8].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA warnings**: Empagliflozin can cause volume depletion and acute transient creatinine rises [^112GX1BU]; postmarketing reports include AKI requiring hospitalization or dialysis [^114mmSiF].

- **UK Kidney Association**: Temporarily withhold SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness or AKI [^115nTXzm]; resume only when clinically stable and renal function has recovered.

- **KDIGO**: Emphasizes careful management of nephrotoxic drugs [^1128f7Be] and close monitoring in AKI [^112SzyRY].

---

## Risks associated with empagliflozin in AKI

- **Volume depletion**: Osmotic diuresis can worsen hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion [^114mmSiF].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Reduced intraglomerular pressure can acutely lower GFR and worsen AKI [^112GX1BU].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Risk of hyperkalemia and other abnormalities.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Increased risk, especially in acute illness or reduced insulin states [^114NcY2t] [^114mmSiF].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Patient with AKI | Immediately discontinue empagliflozin; correct volume status; monitor renal function until recovery [^115nTXzm] |
| Patient recovering from AKI | Consider restarting only after full renal recovery and clinical stability [^115nTXzm] |
| Patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without AKI | Empagliflozin may be beneficial for renal and cardiovascular outcomes, but monitor renal function closely [^116BsyB6] [^112kjQJi] [^113Lbc3c] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly check serum creatinine and eGFR [^112SzyRY].

- **Volume status assessment**: Monitor for hypovolemia and correct promptly [^115nTXzm].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Check potassium and other electrolytes regularly [^112SzyRY].

- **Patient education**: Instruct patients to stop empagliflozin during acute illness or dehydration and seek medical attention [^114mmSiF] [^114NcY2t].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Empagliflozin **should not be initiated or continued in patients with AKI** because of the risks of volume depletion, hemodynamic instability, and electrolyte disturbances. Temporarily **withhold during acute illness or AKI**, and resume only after renal recovery and clinical stability [^115nTXzm]. If AKI occurs during therapy, stop the drug, correct volume status, and monitor renal function until recovery.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and others at risk for ketoacidosis, as indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Jardiance, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Jardiance.

Withhold Jardiance, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Jardiance when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Jardiance and seek medical attention immediately if these signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Jardiance can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Jardiance in patients with one or more of these characteristics, consider evaluating risk factors thoroughly.

### Jardiance [^112GX1BU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory test abnormalities in clinical trials: Initiation of Jardiance causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy, and then these changes stabilize. In a trial of adults with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, the increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR generally did not exceed 0.1 mg/dL and -9.0 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, at Week 4, and reversed after treatment discontinuation. This suggests that acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with Jardiance.

- **Increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)**: Dose-related increases in LDL-C were observed in adults treated with Jardiance. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, Jardiance 10 mg, and Jardiance 25 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.

- **Increase in hematocrit**: In a pool of four placebo-controlled trials in adults, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in Jardiance 10 mg and 2.8% in Jardiance 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, Jardiance 10 mg, and Jardiance 25 mg, respectively.

- **Postmarketing experience**: Additional adverse reactions have been identified.

- **Recommendations for implementation: Acute kidney injury (AKI), hypovolaemia, and potassium**: We recommend that individuals initiated on an SGLT-2 inhibitor do not routinely require an early assessment of kidney function or potassium following the initiation of treatment (Grade 1C). If an individual has a kidney function assessment within the first few weeks post-initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor, a decline in eGFR needs to be interpreted with caution and in the context of an expected drug effect to avoid unwarranted discontinuation of treatment (Grade 2B). Individuals on diuretics should be counseled on the symptoms of hypovolaemia and advised to seek medical attention if they develop any such symptoms after starting SGLT-2 inhibition (Grade 2B). Clinicians should consider an early clinical review and, if appropriate, a diuretic or antihypertensive dose reduction in individuals they consider at high risk of hypovolaemia (Grade 2C). We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors are temporarily withheld during acute illness (Grade 1C).

- **Rationale**: SGLT-2 inhibitors have proven benefits in reducing the rate of long-term decline in kidney function in certain groups of people with CKD. The means by which they provide this benefit may involve changes to intraglomerular pressure and a reduction in hyperfiltration at an individual glomerulus level. This can result in a reduction in eGFR over the initial few weeks following the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which is relatively small, largely reversible, and should not usually be seen as an adverse effect.

### Jardiance [^113Lbc3c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Jardiance for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m², 91 adult patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 97 patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The glucose-lowering benefit of Jardiance 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions, and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of Jardiance for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

Jardiance was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions].

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

- **Results**: Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, indicating a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% reduction.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^115h2ND8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

**Acute effects on measurements of kidney function**: It is well established that SGLT2 inhibitors result in an initial drop in total eGFR, related to altered intra-renal haemodynamics. Reductions in intraglomerular pressure may acutely cause a drop in eGFR due to reduced filtration pressure but are protective against a decline in kidney function over time by reducing nephron loss. The effect on eGFR was clearly demonstrated in the CREDENCE trial, where participants receiving canagliflozin experienced a larger reduction in eGFR in the first 3 weeks than with placebo (between-group difference of −3.17 mL/min/1.73 m²) but then a much smaller decline in eGFR over time (−1.85 ± 0.13 vs. −4.59 ± 0.14 mL/min/1.73 m²). By 12 months, the two groups had a similar change in eGFR from baseline, and thereafter, the canagliflozin arm had a more favourable eGFR change from baseline. The acute drop in eGFR reverses upon medication cessation, providing reassurance it is not due to injury. Large trials, including the CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients – Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trials, of canagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, demonstrated the acute treatment-associated eGFR drop was reversible when treatment was ceased at the end of the study. Despite early reports raising concern about an AKI risk with SGLT2 inhibitor use, later clinical trial evidence and large real-world studies have demonstrated SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of AKI.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of empagliflozin PO (also known as Jardiance):

- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold empagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.

- **Fournier's gangrene**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.

- **Lower extremity amputation**: Use extreme caution in patients with a history of prior amputation, PAD, or neuropathy.

- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: Use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1128f7Be]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

Use of drugs associated with kidney injury or dysfunction is common both in the hospital setting and in the community for patients with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and CKD. These drugs are often referred to as "nephrotoxic", although many of them lead to kidney dysfunction without direct glomerular or tubular cell damage. Furthermore, some drugs may cause a rise in serum creatinine but are actually reno-protective and associated with improved outcomes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy.

Although it would be ideal to propose a simple yet inclusive term to encompass the various mechanisms by which drugs interface with the kidney, meeting participants were unable to identify one. Thus, the term "nephrotoxic drugs" is retained for consistency with the literature. A new classification should also encompass drugs that are not directly harmful to kidney function but are eliminated by the renal route, where there is concern about harm from the accumulation of the parent drug or metabolites in the setting of AKI and AKD. Similarly, failure to adjust drug doses and intervals during renal recovery or with enhanced elimination via extracorporeal clearance may lead to therapeutic failure.

In the past 10 years, significant progress has been made regarding susceptibility, management, and preventive strategies to avoid or ameliorate drug- and drug combination–associated kidney injury.

### Jardiance [^116ZqBXG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥ 20 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m²). The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on the time to kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

A total of 6,609 patients were equally randomized to either JARDIANCE 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 24 months. The mean age of the study population was 63 years (range: 18 to 94 years) and 67% were male. Approximately 58% of the study population were White, 36% Asian, and 4% Black or African American. Additionally, around 44% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.

At baseline, the mean eGFR was 37 mL/min/1.73 m². Specifically, 21% of patients had an eGFR equal to or above 45 mL/min/1.73 m², 44% had an eGFR from 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and 35% had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The median UACR was 329 mg/g, with 20% of patients having a UACR of 300 mg/g. Approximately 1% of patients had type 1 diabetes at baseline. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy and other related causes.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: Analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety, using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

- **Results**: Of 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar advantages.

### The safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in diabetic patients submitted to elective percutaneous coronary intervention regarding kidney function: SAFE-PCI pilot study [^1141kqg9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

In our trial, the use of empagliflozin before PCI did not increase the occurrence of AKI in patients with T2D and stable CAD undergoing PCI, as evidenced by serum NGAL value and creatinine curve. Additionally, there were similar rates of CI-AKI between groups.

These observations are consistent with previously reported data from non-randomized clinical trials. Despite the occurrence of kidney injury after the use of contrast media, CI-AKI rates did not rise after PCI when associated with the use of SGLT2i. To the best of our knowledge, SAFE-PCI was the first trial to evaluate kidney injury in the context of PCI through the assessment of NGAL as an early predictor of CI-AKI, which is a biomarker more accurate than serum creatinine.

Part of the benefits of SGLT2i is attributed to the reduction in blood pressure, weight, and albuminuria. A recently published meta-analysis, including data from the three largest randomized studies with this therapeutic class (DECLARE, EMPA-REG, and CANVAS), indicated a 44% reduction in the incidence of AKI in the population using SGLT2i compared to the control group. Although SAFE-PCI is a pilot study, it is the first randomized trial evaluating the impact of SGLT2i on the peri-procedural status of stable CAD and T2D patients undergoing PCI.

The reduction of Na+ reabsorption by the kidney, associated with SGLT2 inhibition, and the consequent reduction of Na+/K+ ATPase activity in the proximal tubule seem to be related to greater perfusion and oxygenation in the renal cortex, as well as a greater tolerance to ischemia and reperfusion injury.

### Diuretics for preventing and treating acute kidney injury [^113s4tXG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized complication of critical illnesses, significantly impacting morbidity and mortality risk. Diuretics are commonly employed to address excess fluid accumulation and oliguria associated with AKI. Their widespread use is due to their ability to lower the energy demands of renal tubular cells by inhibiting transporters and removing intratubular casts. Numerous studies have examined diuretics' role in preventing and treating AKI; however, a comprehensive systematic review is still lacking.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to explore the benefits and harms of diuretics for both the prevention and treatment of AKI.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to May 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, as well as conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which diuretics were used to prevent or treat AKI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standardized data extraction forms. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was used. The primary review outcomes for AKI prevention and treatment remain a focal point for ongoing research efforts.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

- **Methods**: In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or a matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m², with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

- **Results**: Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group).

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: An observational cohort study [^11374VHA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our large cohort of metformin users provides a reassuring message of the safety of metformin in patients with or without a background of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supports the recent revision of FDA and EMA guidance on metformin prescribing in patients with renal impairment. We have also demonstrated that metformin does not adversely affect survival in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

### The Empagliflozin Comparative Effectiveness and Safety (EMPRISE) Study Programme: Design and Exposure Accrual for an Evaluation of Empagliflozin in Routine Clinical Care [^113vFXbv]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Follow-up for study outcomes started the day after the initiation of treatment and continued in an "as-treated" approach until discontinuation or switch to a drug in the comparator class, the occurrence of an outcome of interest, a nursing home admission, death, healthcare plan disenrollment, or the end of the study period (30 September 2015 for this first interim analysis), whichever came first. We extended the exposure effect window until 30 days after the end of the last prescription's supply. To address more fully potential exposure misclassification, informative censoring, and the nature of the specific outcome assessed, 24 planned sensitivity analyses include the redefinition of the exposure risk window to 14 or 90 days after the end of the last prescription's days' supply interval, and the application of an intention-to-treat type approach, which will carry forward the initial exposure until the occurrence of a study event, healthcare plan disenrollment, admission to a nursing home, or the end of the study period.

- **Study outcomes**: EMPRISE will assess several effectiveness, safety, and healthcare utilization outcomes (Figure 2). Primary outcomes of interest include the following: a 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), and all-cause mortality. In prior investigations, the positive predictive values of the validated ICD-9-code-based algorithms used to define these cardiovascular primary outcomes were 84% or higher.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: Towards an indication to treat diabetic kidney disease [^113oTTUf]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

There were initial safety concerns as SGLT2i adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included acute kidney injury (AKI), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), amputations, urinary and genital tract infections (UTIs), bladder cancer, and bone fractures. However, recent trials have downplayed these risks, and the benefit-risk balance remains positive. Interestingly, in a pooled analysis of 11 Phase 3 RCTs, dapagliflozin use in patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 12 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD G3b–4) decreased the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), blood pressure (BP), and body weight without modulating glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or increasing major side effects. This observation supports the concept of positive renal and cardiac effects of SGLT2i independent from glycemic control.

In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiorenal protection in DKD and the indications for SGLT2i treatment in DKD patients according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as suggestions by the scientific community to update the indication to include overt DKD. We also propose clinical practice recommendations for the safe use of SGLT2i in DKD patients on other antidiabetic, hypertension, and diuretic treatments.

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^112GV3mL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Although SGLT2 inhibitors stabilize eGFR and reduce renal function progression and uric acid, the US FDA has strengthened existing warnings about the risk of AKI with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin and recommended assessing renal function before initiating canagliflozin or dapagliflozin, followed by periodic monitoring. In the event of AKI, the drug should be discontinued immediately, and renal impairment treated.

In clinical studies, SGLT2 inhibitors had the lowest risk of AKI (5.59%) compared with other drugs and controls. Several recent meta-analyses indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of AKI. A network meta-analysis of 18 studies, including 156,690 patients with T2DM, reported that SGLT2 inhibitors were related to a lower risk of AKI compared with placebo (OR = 0.76). Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly related to a reduced risk of AKI compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (OR = 0.79) and DPP-4 inhibitors (OR = 0.68).

A retrospective study showed AKI in 0.3% of patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. After adjustment, patients who developed AKI were more likely to be male, were ≥ 65 years old, had a lower body mass index, had a history of HF, and used diuretics more frequently than those who did not.

Both clinical studies and meta-analyses have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors are related to lower AKI, but patients are still at risk of developing AKI. There are three mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk of AKI: decreased effective volume due to excessive diuresis and excessive drop in transglomerular pressure.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^1158GshT]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In patients with acute MI and increased risk for HF, empagliflozin had kidney-protective effects by reducing the decline in eGFR. Empagliflozin decreased the rate of HF endpoints, and these findings were consistent irrespective of baseline kidney function. Initiation of empagliflozin therapy shortly after acute MI was safe, with similar AE rates in the empagliflozin and placebo groups, regardless of baseline kidney function, blood pressure, or use of clinically relevant concomitant therapies.

In clinical practice, physicians may worry about starting SGLT2 inhibitors because of an acute decrease in eGFR, as patients with acute MI are a vulnerable population due to high rates of contrast exposure and AKI. However, this study shows that the acute treatment effect on eGFR with empagliflozin was similar to placebo. After an initial decline in eGFR at 2 weeks, eGFR fully recovered among patients in the empagliflozin group; in the long term, it decreased among patients in the placebo group. This initial change in eGFR has previously been observed with SGLT2 inhibitors; it is hemodynamic and therefore non-harmful in the long term. Among the subgroups, an initial eGFR decline with empagliflozin and placebo was observed in patients with an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² but not among those with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². Previous studies of empagliflozin showed a subgroup of patients who had increases in eGFR after treatment initiation, although these patients did not sustain these improvements in eGFR in a longitudinal follow-up.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117NHFcY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable, given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions, including diabetes and heart failure.

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop the study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy following a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression, such as percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^116Y3cMm]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) is considered to be due to volume depletion resulting from natriuresis, the effect on tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), and consequent kidney medullary hypoxia. The US FDA issued an initial warning for increased AKI risk in December 2015, and then strengthened the warning in June 2016 for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. However, the incidence of AKI was significantly lower in patients receiving dapagliflozin compared with placebo (1.5% vs 2.0%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.87) in the DECLARE TIMI-58 study. Similar observations were reported from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS program. A recent meta-analysis reported a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2i (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54–0.80). The reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression. Furthermore, a Cochrane meta-analysis published in September 2018 concluded that SGLT2i have little or no risk of AKI in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the possibility of AKI should not preclude the use of SGLT2i in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD. SGLT2i should be discontinued if the GFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Patients can be carefully monitored for any incidence of AKI. Similar monitoring is required for a rare but serious genital infection called Fournier's gangrene, for which the FDA has issued a warning.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^1167EsK2]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The adverse events associated with SGLT2 and concomitant therapies indicate that the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) using dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin varies between 57.3% and 83.0% in different clinical trials. This is similar to other antidiabetic drugs, where, for example, with metformin, it ranges between 36.6% and 81.0%. The most frequent AEs associated with these inhibitors are infections of the genitourinary tract, including vulvovaginitis in women and balanitis in men, with a frequency between 3.6% and 9.0%. Patients typically experience only a single, mild episode that responds well to standard treatment.

SGLT2 inhibitors, when used in monotherapy, are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia due to their insulin-independent mechanism of action. However, long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been associated with a rise in plasma glucagon levels and increased hepatic glucose production. Interestingly, SGLT2-induced glucagon secretion is prevented by administering sulfonylureas concomitantly, which explains the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used together. The frequency of hypoglycemia significantly increases when SGLT2 inhibitors are used alongside a background therapy that includes sulfonylureas or insulin, compared to placebo. Reported frequencies of hypoglycemia using SGLT2 inhibitors vary greatly, ranging from 6.9% to 43.2% with sulfonylureas and from 29.2% to 60.4% with insulin. Adverse events are more likely to occur during the first few days or weeks of treatment.

Reducing the insulin dose has also been associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding this association.

### SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: A preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow down the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Canagliflozin and kidney-related adverse events in type 2 diabetes and CKD: Findings from the randomized CREDENCE trial [^1159MEbB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and related outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial. This analysis of CREDENCE trial data examines the effect of canagliflozin on the incidence of kidney-related adverse events (AEs).

- **Study design**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial.

- **Setting & participants**: 4,401 trial participants with T2DM, CKD, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio > 300–5,000 mg/g.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100 mg/d or placebo.

- **Outcomes**: Rates of kidney-related AEs were analyzed using an on-treatment approach, overall and by screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strata (30- < 45, 45- < 60, and 60- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m²).

- **Results**: Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the overall incidence rate of kidney-related AEs (60.2 vs. 84.0 per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.61–0.82]; P < 0.001), with consistent results for serious kidney-related AEs (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.51–1.00]; P = 0.05) and acute kidney injury (AKI; HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64–1.13]; P = 0.3). The rates of kidney-related AEs were lower with canagliflozin relative to placebo across the three eGFR strata (HRs of 0.73, 0.60, and 0.81 for eGFR 30- < 45, 45- < 60, and 60- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively; P = 0.3 for interaction), with similar results for AKI (P = 0.9 for interaction).

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1154sVsb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The pre-specified primary post-trial assessment was the effect of allocation to empagliflozin during the original active trial on the time to the composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death occurring at any time during the entire follow-up period (i.e. the active trial and post-trial follow-up periods combined). Kidney disease progression was defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization, ESKD, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min/1.73 m², or death from kidney failure. Confirmation of "sustained" required values on two consecutive eGFR measurements at least 30 days apart, or was assumed if it was the last eGFR value before death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of a participant's follow-up.

In primary analyses, previously reported primary outcomes from the active trial period were carried over irrespective of later eGFR results collected during the post-trial period. As central samples were not collected during the post-trial follow-up period, all eGFR-based post-trial measurements were relative to the local eGFR measurement at baseline (see Supplementary Methods for more details).

The post-trial follow-up protocol pre-specified key secondary outcomes of kidney disease progression alone, and the composite of death from any cause or ESKD. The other secondary outcome was ESKD. Tertiary outcomes were death from any cause and, separately, death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes (the latter being the safety outcome for post-trial follow-up), and the primary outcome was assessed by key subgroups of interest.

### Acute kidney injury in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors: A propensity-matched analysis [^116GQcvS]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new medications that improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the Food and Drug Administration has issued alerts regarding an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. This study aimed to assess the real-world risk of AKI in new SGLT2 inhibitor users across two large health care utilization cohorts of patients with T2D.

- **Research design and methods**: We used longitudinal data from the Mount Sinai chronic kidney disease registry and the Geisinger Health System cohort. SGLT2 inhibitor users and nonusers (patients with T2D without SGLT2 inhibitor prescription) were selected. The definition of AKI was based on the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria. A 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity matching was performed, and unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) as well as adjusted HRs (aHRs; accounting for covariates poorly balanced) for AKI in primary and sensitivity analyses were calculated.

- **Results**: In the Mount Sinai cohort, we identified 377 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 377 nonusers, with 3.8% and 9.7% respectively experiencing an AKI KDIGO event over a median follow-up time of 14 months. The unadjusted hazards of AKI KDIGO were 60% lower in users (HR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.01), and this remained unchanged post-adjustment (aHR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.004). Similarly, in the Geisinger cohort, 1,207 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 1,207 nonusers were identified, with 2.2% and 4.6% having an AKI KDIGO event. AKI KDIGO unadjusted hazards were lower in users (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0…).

### Jardiance [^116sz57g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin were investigated in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of empagliflozin at 10 mg and 25 mg resulted in exposure within the range observed in adult patients.

- **Effects of age, body mass index, gender, and race**: Age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and race (Asians versus primarily Whites) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin.

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: In adult patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, the area under the curve (AUC) of empagliflozin increased by approximately 23%, 47%, and 75%, and Cmax increased by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild (eGFR: 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate (eGFR: 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and severe (eGFR: less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) renal impairment, and patients on dialysis due to kidney failure, the AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in patients with moderate renal impairment and patients on dialysis compared to those with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels were roughly 20% higher in patients with mild and severe renal impairment.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^112XM4J8]. Diabetes Care (2020). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE), including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline > 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.

- **Research design and methods**: In a cohort study of 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

- **Results**: Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with a 0.99 mL/min/1.73 m² (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) less annual reduction in eGFR, a 0.25 kg/m² (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) more annual decrease in BMI, and reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]).

	- **Empagliflozin use showed reduced risk of MAKE across eGFR categories**:
		- eGFR ≥ 90 (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82])
		- ≥ 60 to < 90 (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.60, 0.73])
		- ≥ 45 to < 60 (HR 0.78 [95% CI 0.69, 0.89])
		- ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.55, 0.92])

	- Among participants without albuminuria and those with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, the HRs were 0.65 (95% CI 0.57, 0.75), 0.72 (95% CI 0.66, 0.79), and 0.74 (95% CI 0.62, 0.88), respectively.

	- In participants with and without cardiovascular disease, HRs were 0.67 (95% CI 0.61, 0.74) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.69, 0.83), respectively.

The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication.

### Jardiance [^1169dqKX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There is limited information regarding the presence of Jardiance in human milk, the effects of Jardiance on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Empagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data]. Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be a risk to the developing human kidney.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, including the potential for empagliflozin to affect postnatal renal development, advise patients that the use of Jardiance is not recommended while breastfeeding.

- **Data**: Empagliflozin was present at a low level in rat fetal tissues following a single oral dose to the dams at gestation day 18. In rat milk, the mean milk to plasma ratio ranged from 0.634 to 5 and was greater than one from 2 to 24 hours post-dose. The mean maximal milk to plasma ratio of 5 occurred at 8 hours post-dose, suggesting accumulation of empagliflozin in the milk. Juvenile rats directly exposed to empagliflozin showed a risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^112B4tCc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven renal benefits, such as empagliflozin or canagliflozin, to reduce the risk of progression of nephropathy. This is specifically advised for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², especially if glycemic targets are not achieved with existing antihyperglycemic medications.

### Jardiance [^115wqfkX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Jardiance is indicated for several uses:

- **Cardiovascular and heart failure reduction**: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure.
- **Chronic kidney disease management**: To reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
- **Type 2 diabetes management**: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, and as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Limitations of use**:
	- Jardiance is not recommended for improving glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus due to an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
	- It is also not recommended for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as it is likely to be ineffective in this setting based on its mechanism of action.
	- Jardiance is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or those requiring or with a recent history of intravenous immunosuppressive therapy, or handling more than 45 mg of prednisone or equivalent for kidney disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. It's not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^117XaRxc]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Revisions in treatment guidelines for DKD management are based on the outcomes of the CREDENCE trial in patients with CKD. The ADA 2020 and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2019 consensus statements strongly recommend (strength of recommendation A and 1B, respectively) sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) as a first-line standard of care for people with T2DM and DKD with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², especially in those with > 300 mg/g albuminuria, with or without ASCVD, provided they have adequate renal function.

- **Safety concerns and contraindications with SGLT2i**: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are increasingly recognized as antihyperglycemic agents for people with T2DM having established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for CVD, and for those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. However, healthcare providers need to be cautious and vigilant about specific safety concerns while prescribing them. Regulatory agencies, including the US FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Health Canada, have issued safety warnings for several adverse events, which include acute kidney injury (AKI), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), bone fractures, lower limb amputations, and acute and chronic pancreatitis. The association of acute and chronic pancreatitis with SGLT2i was reported in a safety review by Health Canada, which concluded that there may be a link between the use of SGLT2i and the risk of acute pancreatitis, though there was only limited evidence to suggest a link with chronic pancreatitis.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated the effect of empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF).

Methods and results: Individuals were randomized to receive empagliflozin at 10 mg, 25 mg, or a placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events.

At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with HF than without. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events per 100 patient-years was higher in patients with HF compared to those without.

Metformin should not be restarted for at least 48 hours and only if kidney function remains stable (less than 25% increase compared with baseline creatinine). Additionally, the ongoing use of metformin must be re-assessed by the patient's clinical team.

### Acute renal outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: Real-world data analysis [^111WJZfs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

To assess the possible risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i), as well as changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hospitalizations, and mortality in a real-world setting, a historical cohort study was conducted. The study included patients with type 2 diabetes from a large health organization in Israel who initiated therapy with SGLT2-i or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) during the period from April 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. Data on serum creatinine measurements were collected from 180 days prior to and up to 24 weeks after therapy initiation. The study endpoints included a ≥ 30% reduction in eGFR, hospitalization with AKI, any hospitalization, and all-cause mortality.

Overall, 6,418 patients initiated SGLT2-i and 5,604 patients initiated DPP-4i. The baseline mean (SD) eGFR was higher in the SGLT2-i group compared to the DPP-4i group — 88.3 (17.4) and 82.8 (23.7), respectively — but were similar when stratifying by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for a ≥ 30% reduction in eGFR with SGLT2-i versus DPP-4i was 0.70 (0.49–1.00). ORs ranged from 1.97 (0.62–6.26) to 0.45 (0.21–0.99) in patients with baseline eGFR between 30 to 45 and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. Risks of AKI (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.80), hospitalization (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56–0.78), or all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.95) were lower in patients initiating SGLT2-i compared to those initiating DPP-4i.

This real-world data analysis supports reassuring findings from previous studies regarding the safety of SGLT2-i concerning renal outcomes and mortality reduction.

### Network meta-analysis of novel glucose-lowering drugs on risk of acute kidney injury [^114xGfzL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Little is known about the comparative effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), or sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to compare the effects of these three novel classes of glucose-lowering drugs on AKI risk in patients with or without type 2 diabetes, by network meta-analysis of event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We systematically searched electronic databases up to September 2020 and included 20 event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials. Eighteen trials included patients with type 2 diabetes only, and two trials included patients with or without type 2 diabetes. A network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed to compare the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of AKI, and estimate the probability for each intervention as the safest one. The primary analysis included 18 trials with type 2 diabetes only, and a secondary analysis included 20 trials.

- **Results**: In the 18 trials with a total of 2051 AKI events (range: 1–300) among 156,690 patients with type 2 diabetes only, our network meta-analysis showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of AKI compared with placebo (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.88), whereas both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs had neutral effects on the risk of AKI. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly associated with a lower risk in AKI than both GLP.

### Consistent effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of diabetic kidney disease categories: Insights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^113LA1up]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

To explore the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney effects of empagliflozin in patients with different clinical phenotypes of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (i.e. with the presence or absence of overt albuminuria) participating in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomized participants (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or a placebo, in addition to the standard of care.

Post hoc analysis categorized patients with different clinical phenotypes of DKD at baseline into three subgroups: (a) overt DKD (overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/g] with any estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]; n = 769), (b) non-overt DKD (kidney impairment [eGFR ≥ 50 - < 90 mL/min/1.73 m²] without overt albuminuria; n = 1,827), and (c) normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with normoalbuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g]; n = 1,052).

Empagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV death across all categories without significant interaction between treatment, DKD category, and CV death. Notably, no significant differences were observed between treatment groups concerning kidney outcome events (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.81, 1.73]; P > .05), consistent with the overall trial population findings. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced the yearly loss of eGFR, assessed by chronic slopes in all subgroups. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin was similar across all subgroups.

In conclusion, empagliflozin may improve CV and kidney outcomes and slow the progression of DKD across different patient phenotypes.

### Jardiance [^114EMLne]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In vitro assessment of drug interactions: Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Empagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of the major CYP450 isoforms or UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. The effect of UGT induction (e.g. induction by rifampicin or any other UGT enzyme inducer) on empagliflozin exposure has not been evaluated.

Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these uptake transporters.

In vivo assessment of drug interactions: Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin.

### Acute kidney injury with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^111ohiNz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Three multicentre, large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have each shown substantial reductions in rates of hospitalization for heart failure and progression of chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes. However, safety concerns remain for this ostensibly paradigm-shifting drug class. In particular, the US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality.

To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of the three trials to compare the frequency of AKI adverse event reports between participants treated with placebo and those who had received an SGLT2 inhibitor. Rather than an increase, we noted a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.80).

We further noted that the reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression. The caveats of the non-adjudicated reporting of AKI in the trials notwithstanding, these data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may protect vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes from AKI and that prospective studies to evaluate this additional aspect of kidney protection are warranted.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimize the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set.

- **Findings**: In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (95% CI -0.88 to -0.49) for empagliflozin 25 mg.

### Dapagliflozin for critically ill patients with acute organ dysfunction: The DEFENDER randomized clinical trial [^116aJ2ML]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The DEFENDER study, published by Caio A. M. Tavares and colleagues in 2024 in JAMA, examines the diseases critical illness and acute kidney injury. The trial investigates the role of dapagliflozin in patients with critical illness and acute organ dysfunction. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving a population of 507 patients (238 female, 269 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with unplanned ICU admission and presenting with at least one organ dysfunction.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Organ dysfunction for more than 24 hours; end-stage kidney disease undergoing maintenance dialysis; prior use of dapagliflozin or other SGLT-2 inhibitors; type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); diabetic ketoacidosis; planned ICU admission following elective surgery.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Dapagliflozin group (n = 248)**: Standard care plus 10 mg of dapagliflozin for up to 14 days or until ICU discharge.
	- **Standard care group (n = 259)**: Standard of care for up to 14 days or until ICU discharge.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the rate of hospital death, initiation of kidney replacement therapy, and shorter ICU length of stay through 28 days (42.3% vs. 41.9%; WR 1.01, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.13).
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in hospital death (35.5% vs. 34.4%; OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52). No significant difference in initiation of kidney replacement therapy (10.9% vs. 15.2%; OR 0.76, 95% CI).

### Safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: Pooled analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112gGCZB]. Diabetes Care (2022). High credibility.

To assess the safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (category G3–4) enrolled in clinical trials, this analysis pooled data from 19 randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–4 clinical trials and 1 randomized, placebo-controlled extension study in which patients received empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily. Time to first occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression models.

Among a total of 15,081 patients who received at least one study drug dose, 1,522, 722, and 123 were classified as having G3A, G3B, and G4 CKD, respectively, at baseline. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups across CKD categories. Rates of serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and events of special interest (including lower limb amputations and acute renal failure [ARF]) were also similar between empagliflozin and placebo across CKD subgroups. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, risks for volume depletion and ARF were similar for empagliflozin and placebo in the combined group with CKD categories G3B and G4 and the G3A group. Notably lower risks were observed in both groups for hyperkalemia (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.37–0.96, P = 0.0323] and 0.48 [0.26–0.91, P = 0.0243], respectively) and edema (0.47 [0.33–0.68, P < 0.0001] and 0.44 [0.28–0.68, P = 0.0002], respectively).

In conclusion, the use of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD raised no new safety concerns.

### Evaluating the overall renal outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^114YJV1X]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding AKI, the SGLT2 inhibitors treatment group showed a significant reduction in risk compared with controls, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, further subgroup analyses revealed that the attenuated occurrence of AKI was mainly derived from empagliflozin. These differences may be partly explained by the patients' characteristics of baseline diabetes (empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin: 55.8% vs. 77.5%) and the other three SGLT2 inhibitors all assigned diabetes. Additionally, the limited reported trials in CKD patients for the other four SGLT2 inhibitors may impact the results (fewer than 2 trials), highlighting the need for larger subgroup studies. At the time of writing, the precise mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors prevent AKI remains unclear. The possible mechanisms include a reduction in intraglomerular pressure by enhancing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreasing tubular oxygen consumption, mitigating renal inflammation, and restoring the metabolism of cellular energy. More research is needed to confirm this finding and its underlying mechanism.

We also confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of volume-related AEs with renal insufficiency compared with controls, consistent with previous meta-analyses. However, our subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk exclusively in stage 2 CKD (OR 1.426, 95% CI 1.151–1.767, P = 0.001). This may be attributed to the diminished, but not entirely failed, renal capacity to regulate volume and sodium in the early stages of CKD.

### Reading between the (guide)lines — the KDIGO practice guideline on acute kidney injury in the individual patient [^115qv7nj]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^116dTxPJ]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced heart failure (HF) events among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and an increased risk for HF, although without improvement in all-cause mortality. Patients with acute MI have a high burden of kidney dysfunction, with about 40% having chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high rates of acute decompensated HF.

Data regarding the cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI with variable kidney function are limited. DAPA-MI (Dapagliflozin Effects on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Patients With an Acute Heart Attack) was the only other clinical trial to evaluate SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI, but it had limited enrollment of patients with kidney dysfunction, few HF events, and did not assess kidney outcomes. Studies of patients with HF have shown the benefit and safety of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors early, among many patients at index hospital admission, but have not assessed the safety in patients with acute MI. It is especially important to understand this safety profile among patients with acute MI because these individuals have a high risk for acute kidney injuries (AKIs), substantial risk for volume depletion or hypotension, and regular exposure to kidney stressors, such as contrast for imaging or cardiac catheterization or kidney-function-altering medications.
