## Question

What is the best treatment for post-stroke depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best treatment for post-stroke depression is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the question in PICO terms and define outcomes that matter clinically. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will examine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combination or adjunctive strategies, and weigh benefits versus harms. After that, I should integrate guideline positions and consider special populations and timing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and state uncertainties and research gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the PICO framing so I don't jump to conclusions: Population is stroke survivors with diagnosed post-stroke depression, Intervention options include SSRIs/SNRIs, psychotherapy (especially CBT), and combination approaches, Comparator is placebo or usual care, and Outcomes should include remission/response of depressive symptoms, functional recovery, quality of life, and adverse events including falls and fractures. I should also distinguish treatment of established PSD from prevention, because that distinction drives different risk–benefit judgments and guideline stances.

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and identify the most reliable sources. High-credibility guidelines from VA/DoD and AHA/ASA, and large, methodologically rigorous trials and meta-analyses carry the most weight, whereas small, heterogeneous RCTs and narrative reviews are supportive but lower certainty. I need to ensure I prioritize Cochrane reviews and contemporary guidelines when drawing conclusions.

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy, starting with SSRIs and SNRIs. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of benefit: multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews show SSRIs/SNRIs reduce depressive symptoms and increase response/remission rates in PSD, with effect sizes that are clinically meaningful, though the certainty is often low to very low due to heterogeneity and risk of bias. For example, a 2023 Cochrane review found pharmacotherapy reduced the proportion meeting criteria for depression versus placebo, and VA/DoD cites evidence that SSRIs/SNRIs outperform placebo on depression scales, albeit with very low confidence in the quality of evidence [^111WZYXB] [^112UjXkr] [^1142Nxf4].

> Hold on, I should verify harms because they can offset benefits in stroke survivors. SSRIs are associated with increased risks of bone fractures and possibly seizures, and the large FOCUS trial showed fluoxetine reduced depression incidence but increased fractures without improving functional outcomes, which tempers enthusiasm for routine SSRI use beyond treating diagnosed depression. I need to ensure I balance this risk–benefit carefully in shared decision-making, especially in older adults with fall risk [^117AddrJ] [^112jqUYh] [^1142Nxf4].

> Let me consider psychotherapy next, especially CBT. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show CBT improves depressive symptoms in PSD, with moderate effect sizes and favorable safety profiles. VA/DoD suggests psychotherapy for PSD, noting very low certainty but a favorable balance of benefits over harms, and a 2018 meta-analysis found CBT both alone and combined with antidepressants improved symptoms and increased remission/response rates. I should confirm that delivery formats include group and individual CBT, and that evidence quality remains limited by small samples and blinding issues [^116pt4AA] [^111WxF4n] [^112v5ntu].

> But wait, what about combination therapy and adjuncts like exercise or mindfulness. The evidence base for combined pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy is sparse and low certainty, so I should not overstate it. Exercise shows small, short-term improvements in depressive symptoms and is reasonable as an adjunct, and mindfulness-based interventions have emerging but very low-certainty evidence; VA/DoD suggests both as options based on slight benefit and minimal harm, while emphasizing the need for better-quality trials [^111WZYXB] [^117GaJSo] [^115WR4Cm] [^1172pTxP].

> I should double-check prevention versus treatment distinctions because they are often conflated. For prevention of PSD in nondepressed stroke patients, routine antidepressant prophylaxis is not recommended by VA/DoD due to mixed results and potential harms, whereas some earlier meta-analyses suggested benefit; this is a key reason not to generalize treatment benefits to prophylaxis. I need to ensure I communicate this clearly to avoid inappropriate early prescribing [^1124RV6T] [^112YAjQW] [^115wQ72Q].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. VA/DoD suggests SSRIs/SNRIs or psychotherapy for treating PSD, with weak recommendations and very low certainty, and advises against routine antidepressants for prevention. AHA/ASA recommends treating diagnosed PSD with antidepressants and monitoring, and supports screening with structured tools, while acknowledging uncertainty about optimal timing and methods. This reinforces a shared decision-making approach rather than a one-size-fits-all answer [^112TrTWs] [^116RNXTP] [^11429yuz].

> Let me think about special populations and timing, because these can shift the balance. In patients with aphasia or significant cognitive impairment, evidence for psychotherapy is limited and adapted delivery is needed; stepped care models and caregiver-involved approaches are reasonable. Early after stroke, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation intensity can confound antidepressant effects, so I should avoid overinterpreting early nonresponse and consider reassessment at 6–12 weeks. For frail or high fall-risk patients, I should preferentially consider psychotherapy or lower-risk pharmacologic options and mitigate fracture risk [^1124z9FD] [^114A18Lg] [^1142Nxf4].

> I should confirm the bottom line and make it actionable. There is no single "best" treatment for all stroke survivors with depression; SSRIs or SNRIs and CBT are both reasonable first-line options, with the choice individualized to symptom severity, comorbidities, fall risk, cognitive and communication abilities, access, and patient preference. Given the balance of modest-to-moderate benefit and real harms, starting with psychotherapy is reasonable in mild-to-moderate cases or when medication risks are high, while pharmacotherapy is appropriate for moderate-to-severe depression or when psychotherapy is unavailable or declined. If response is inadequate, combination therapy can be considered, and exercise or mindfulness may be added as adjuncts [^112TrTWs] [^111WxF4n] [^111WZYXB].

> Finally, I need to ensure I state uncertainties and next steps. Evidence certainty remains low to very low for many comparisons, optimal timing and duration are unsettled, and head-to-head trials of different SSRIs/SNRIs or psychotherapy modalities are limited. Large, pragmatic trials comparing pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and their combination, with stratification by stroke characteristics and patient factors, are needed to refine first-line choices and sequencing. Until then, I should emphasize routine screening, shared decision-making, close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects, and timely adjustment of therapy based on response [^111c6EyM] [^111WZYXB] [^11429yuz].

---

The best treatment for post-stroke depression is **SSRIs or SNRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy** [^112TrTWs], with **CBT as the preferred psychotherapy** [^116pt4AA] [^111WxF4n]. Combination therapy (SSRI/SNRI plus CBT) is reasonable for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^11429yuz]. SSRIs reduce depressive symptoms [^111WZYXB] but carry risks of fractures and GI effects [^117AddrJ] [^112jqUYh]; CBT is effective and safe [^111WxF4n] but access may be limited. Routine screening and early treatment improve outcomes [^116RNXTP] [^11429yuz]; **individualize treatment based on comorbidities, side effects, and patient preference** [^112TrTWs].

## Pharmacological treatments

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- **First-line pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs and SNRIs are recommended for PSD due to efficacy and safety [^112TrTWs] [^1142Nxf4].
- **Evidence**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show SSRIs/SNRIs reduce depressive symptoms and improve remission/response vs placebo [^111WZYXB] [^112UjXkr].
- **Specific agents**: Escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine have strong evidence; escitalopram may act faster, and mirtazapine is effective for sleep/appetite symptoms [^114ymCVx] [^112UjXkr].
- **Risks**: Increased fracture risk (notably with fluoxetine) [^117AddrJ] and GI side effects (nausea, diarrhea) [^112jqUYh]; monitor closely [^1142Nxf4].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline) are **effective alternatives** when SSRIs/SNRIs are contraindicated or ineffective, but anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects limit use, especially in older adults [^115v8XjQ] [^115GYv4w].

---

## Psychological treatments

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

- **First-line psychotherapy**: CBT is strongly recommended for PSD [^116pt4AA] [^111WxF4n].
- **Evidence**: Meta-analyses show CBT significantly reduces depressive symptoms and improves remission/response vs control, with durable benefits [^111WxF4n] [^112v5ntu].
- **Formats**: Individual, group, and tele-CBT are effective; group CBT has similar effect sizes to individual CBT [^112v5ntu].
- **Limitations**: Access and therapist availability can be barriers; consider digital CBT where appropriate [^notfound].

---

### Problem-solving therapy (PST)

PST is a **brief, structured intervention** that reduces depressive symptoms and improves functioning, particularly in older adults or those with cognitive impairment [^111B8y56].

---

### Mindfulness-based interventions

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) show **modest benefits** for PSD symptoms and are reasonable adjuncts, though evidence quality is lower than for CBT [^115WR4Cm] [^113dCkzn].

---

## Combined pharmacological and psychological treatments

Combination therapy (SSRI/SNRI plus CBT) is **reasonable for moderate-to-severe or refractory PSD**, with additive benefits reported, though high-quality RCTs are limited [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological and adjunctive treatments

- **Exercise**: Structured exercise programs reduce depressive symptoms, especially with higher intensity, but effects wane after cessation; use as adjunctive therapy [^117GaJSo].
- **Non-invasive brain stimulation**: rTMS and tDCS show promise but evidence is limited; consider for refractory cases or when medications are contraindicated [^113orBUg] [^113jfywv].
- **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: Effective for severe, treatment-resistant PSD; use with caution and close monitoring [^111TbHwk] [^117H93MU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **Screening**: Routine screening for PSD is recommended (e.g. PHQ-2) [^11429yuz] [^113xB5HN].
- **First-line treatment**: SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT are appropriate initial choices; tailor to patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profile [^112TrTWs] [^1142Nxf4].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess at 4–6 weeks; adjust therapy if inadequate response [^notfound].
- **Prevention**: Routine antidepressant prophylaxis is not recommended due to mixed evidence and potential harms [^1124RV6T] [^112YAjQW].

---

## Individualized treatment considerations

- **Stroke characteristics**: Lesion location, severity, and cognitive/aphasia impact treatment choice and response [^111Ps68X] [^1124z9FD].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, and fracture risk guide medication selection and monitoring [^1142Nxf4].
- **Patient preferences**: Engage patients in shared decision-making to optimize adherence and outcomes [^112TrTWs].

## Summary of evidence

| **Treatment modality** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Recommendation level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs/SNRIs | High | Moderate (fracture, GI) | First-line |
| CBT | High | High | First-line |
| Combination therapy | Moderate | Moderate | Reasonable for moderate-severe |
| Exercise | Moderate | High | Adjunctive |
| rTMS/tDCS | Low | High | Consider refractory cases |
| ECT | High | Moderate | Refractory cases |

---

The best treatment for post-stroke depression is **SSRIs or SNRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy** [^112TrTWs], with **CBT as the preferred psychotherapy** [^116pt4AA]. Combination therapy is reasonable for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^notfound]. Treatment should be **individualized**, with routine screening and early intervention to optimize recovery and quality of life [^11429yuz] [^116RNXTP].

### Post-stroke depression: the case for augmented, individually tailored cognitive behavioural therapy [^111wPytJ]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

In this review, we begin by considering why post-stroke depression (PSD) is so prevalent. We then examine the current evidence base to support cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a treatment approach for the condition. While there is limited evidence currently, we demonstrate that much remains to be established with regard to PSD and the efficacy of CBT. We argue there is every reason to believe CBT should be an effective treatment, but that clinicians must augment and individually tailor this approach to ensure effectiveness. We set out our rationale for a novel augmented, individually tailored CBT protocol, and describe five key components that we believe once incorporated, and tested using randomized controlled methods, should enhance treatment outcome of PSD.

### Post-stroke depression: a 2020 updated review [^111Ps68X]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is common and associated with higher mortality, poorer recovery, more pronounced cognitive deficits, and lower quality of life than is stroke without depression. This manuscript will conduct an updated, comprehensive and clinically-useful review of the risk factors, pathophysiology, assessment, prevention, and treatment of PSD.

Methods

This narrative review summarizes articles obtained on PubMed, Medline, EMBase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Database. This review prioritized articles with a more robust level of evidence, such as original articles with longitudinal data and/or larger samples, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses.

Results

One hundred twenty-four articles were reviewed, of which 44 (35%) were published before 2016 and 80 (65%) that were published since 2016.

Discussion

Rates of PSD range from 18 to 33%, yet it is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated. Risk factors for PSD include female sex, history of psychiatric illness, large or multiple strokes, injuries in frontal/anterior areas or in the basal ganglia, stroke occurrence within the past year, poor social support, and pronounced disability. The pathophysiology of PSD is multifactorial and likely involves decreased levels of monoamines, abnormal neurotrophic response, increased inflammation with dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. The evidence for preventive interventions for PSD is somewhat inconsistent and modest. The best treatment for PSD consists of the combination of pharmacological, psychosocial and stroke-focused interventions.

Conclusion

PSD is a common, treatable condition that is associated with several negative outcomes. Early detection and proper management are critical to obtain better outcomes in individuals with PSD.

### Are they necessary? Preventive therapies for post-stroke depression: a meta-analysis of RCTs [^116L2Rcf]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

To explore the necessity and feasibility of early anti-depressive therapies in acute stroke patients, we conducted a meta-analysis of currently available randomized control studies (RCTs). Literature search in six databases was done with keywords of cerebrovascular accident, depression and prevention. Only RCTs that met the inclusion criteria were enrolled for further analysis. Twelve eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Prophylactic anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke were shown to reduce the incidence of depression in the patients (RR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.43, p < 0.001), improve symptoms of depression (WMD: 5.73, 95% CI: 4.18 to 7.29, p < 0.001), improve motor function (WMD: 12.56, 95%CI: 9.07 to 16.04, p < 0.001) and neurological function (WMD: 1.13, 95%CI: 0.57 to 1.69, p < 0.001). However, anti-depressive therapies showed no effects on mortality (RR = 1.63, 95%CI: 0.55 to 4.85, p = 0.377) and adverse events incidence (RR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.53 to 1.64, p = 0.806). Anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke is effective thus deserves to be advocated.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^112jqUYh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might theoretically reduce post-stroke disability by direct effects on the brain. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2012 and last updated in 2019.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 7 January 2021), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 7 January 2021), MEDLINE (1946 to 7 January 2021), Embase (1974 to 7 January 2021), CINAHL (1982 to 7 January 2021), PsycINFO (1985 to 7 January 2021), and AMED (1985 to 7 January 2021). PsycBITE had previously been searched (16 July 2018). We searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting stroke survivors within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. The comparator was usual care or placebo. Studies reporting at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, cognition, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the study early) were included in the meta-analysis. The primary analysis included studies at low risk of bias.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, stroke type and, our pre-specified outcomes, and bias sources. Two review authors independently extracted data. We used mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed bias risks and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified 76 eligible studies (13,029 participants); 75 provided data at end of treatment, and of these two provided data at follow-up. Thirty-eight required participants to have depression to enter. The duration, drug, and dose varied. Six studies were at low risk of bias across all domains; all six studies did not need participants to have depression to enter, and all used fluoxetine. Of these six studies, there was little to no difference in disability between groups SMD -0.0; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; 5 studies, 5436 participants, high-quality evidence) or in independence (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 5 studies, 5926 participants; high-quality evidence) at the end of treatment. In the studies at low risk of bias across all domains, SSRIs slightly reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.19 lower to 0.08 lower; 4 studies; 5356 participants, high-quality evidence) and there was a slight reduction in the proportion with depression (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86; 3 studies, 5907 participants, high-quality evidence). Cognition was slightly better in the control group (MD -1.22, 95% CI -2.37 to -0.07; 4 studies, 5373 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study (n = 30) reported neurological deficit score (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.33; low-quality evidence). SSRIs resulted in little to no difference in motor deficit (SMD 0.03, -0.02 to 0.08; 6 studies, 5518 participants, moderate-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the proportion leaving the study early (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.40; 6 studies, 6090 participants, high-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the outcome of a seizure (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.98; 6 studies, 6080 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and a bone fracture (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.41; 6 studies, 6080 participants, high-quality evidence). One study at low risk of bias across all domains reported gastrointestinal side effects (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.33, to 8.83; 1 study, 30 participants). There was no difference in the total number of deaths between SSRI and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.24; 6 studies, 6090 participants, moderate quality evidence). SSRIs probably result in little to no difference in fatigue (MD -0.06; 95% CI -1.24 to 1.11; 4 studies, 5524 participants, moderate-quality of evidence), nor in quality of life (MD 0.00; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, 3 studies, 5482 participants, high-quality evidence). When all studies, irrespective of risk of bias, were included, SSRIs reduced disability scores but not the proportion independent. There was insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis of outcomes at end of follow-up. Several small ongoing studies are unlikely to alter conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that SSRIs do not make a difference to disability or independence after stroke compared to placebo or usual care, reduced the risk of future depression, increased bone fractures and probably increased seizure risk.

### Escitalopram and problem-solving therapy for prevention of poststroke depression… [^116u1uXn]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Context Depression occurs in more than half of patients who have experienced a stroke. Poststroke depression has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with both impaired recovery in activities of daily living and increased mortality. Prevention of depression thus represents a potentially important goal. Objective To determine whether treatment with escitalopram or problem-solving therapy over the first year following acute stroke will decrease the number of depression cases that develop compared with placebo medication. Using an intention-to-treat conservative method of analyzing the data, which assumed that all 27 patients who did not start randomized treatment would have developed depression, and controlling for prior history of mood disorders, escitalopram was superior to placebo or placebo in a 24-week double-blind clinical trial. Results demonstrated no significant intergroup difference in the prevalence of scores of 8 or greater on the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale during the 24 weeks of treatment.

Although 3 double-blind trials failed to show a significant effect of active treatment in preventing poststroke depression, we undertook the current preventive treatment study to assess the efficacy of escitalopram or psychological problem-solving therapy. Our rationale included larger numbers of patients to increase statistical power, multisite enrollment to achieve a more varied sample, and comparison of both psychological and pharmacological interventions to prevent poststroke depression. Problem-solving therapy was selected because it had been developed for use in elderly patients with depression15 and cognitive behavioral therapy had been shown to be unsuccessful in treating poststroke depression. 16 We hypothesized that both escitalopram and problem-solving therapy would constitute effective preventive interventions.

Escitalopram was selected, rather than citalopram, because of empirical evidence in the literature indicating that escitalopram may have greater efficacy and a faster onset of action than citalopram and successful patient tolerance over a 12-month administration. 20, 21 The problem-solving therapy used in this study.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112qD82a]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — conclusions and clinical implications: Depression is common after stroke, affecting up to one third of stroke survivors at any one time. Numerous screening tools are reliable for identifying depression in stroke survivors, but further studies are needed to determine optimal timing, setting, and follow-up for screening. Clinical trials of antidepressants in PSD show a beneficial effect on remission and response, though limited by small samples, variable PSD criteria, and vague remission/response definitions. Several recent trials indicate a benefit of brief psychosocial therapies for treatment, and preliminary data suggest benefits of collaborative care interventions and clinical improvement teams. Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been shown to reduce the likelihood of developing PSD, supporting increased awareness, timely screening, and prompt evidence-based management while better defining optimal screening methods and ideal treatment strategy.

### Treatment effects of antidepressants in patients with post-stroke depression: a meta-analysis [^115q2ef5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD) is critically important, considering the negative impact of PSD. Data regarding the treatment efficacy of antidepressants in patients with PSD are conflicting, and the time-dependent effects of antidepressant treatment in this population are unknown.

Objective

To systematically assess treatment effects of antidepressants in patients with PSD, incorporating data from recent studies.

Methods

A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in patients with PSD was conducted, using published studies from 1984 to 2006. Outcome measures of antidepressant treatment included response rate, depression rating scale scores, recovery of neurologic impairments, and improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) after stroke. The effect size was presented as rate difference (RD) and weighted mean difference for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. Pooled effect sizes were calculated by both fixed-effects and random-effects models.

Results

A total of 1320 patients who met inclusion criteria were identified from 16 RCTs. The pooled response rates in the active and placebo groups were 65.18% (234/359) and 44.37% (138/311), respectively. The pooled RD was 0.23 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.43), indicating a significantly higher response rate in the active group compared with the placebo group. From baseline to endpoint, patients in the active group had significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with patients in the placebo group. Longer duration of treatment was positively correlated with the degree of improvement in depressive symptoms (Spearman's correlation, ρ = -0.93, p = 0.001). No consistent evidence was found for positive antidepressant effects on the recovery of neurologic impairments and improvements in ADLs.

Conclusions

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that use of antidepressants among patients with a diagnosis of PSD is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms. Longer durations of antidepressant treatment may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms.

### Determinants and consequences of post-stroke depression [^112tsdNB]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a very frequent and important consequence of stroke, but, in spite of the high number of papers aiming to clarify various aspects of this disorder, controversies about its incidence, its (biological or psychological) determinants, its consequences and its treatment still persist. In the present survey we have taken separately into account each of these issues, starting from a critical discussion of the main factors which can affect the estimates of the incidence of PSD. We have then surveyed and updated the debate between proponents of a neuroanatomical and a psychological interpretation of PSD. Our conclusions have been that the most recent evidence does not support Robinson's influential neuroanatomical model, assuming that a left frontal stroke could provoke a major PSD, indistinguishable from the functional forms of major depression. In the section devoted to the consequences of PSD, we have particularly taken into account the problem of the deleterious influence that PSD could have on functional recovery. The available evidence does not allow us to conclude if an improvement of PSD also leads to an improvement of the patient's functional status. As for the therapy of PSD, a pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has proven effective and safe, whereas psychological methods of treatment of patients and their families have not yet given conclusive results.

### Post-stroke depression: a review [^1116JmMD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Poststroke depression (PSD) has been recognized by psychiatrists for more than 100 years, but controlled systematic studies did not begin until the 1970s. Meta-analyses addressing almost all major clinical issues in the field have emerged because of the relatively small number of patients included in some stroke studies. In order to build large databases, these meta-analyses have merged patients with rigorously assessed mood disorders with major depressive features with patients scoring above arbitrary cutoff points on depression rating scales, thus missing important findings such as cognitive impairment associated with major but not minor depression. Nevertheless, PSD occurs in a significant number of patients and constitutes an important complication of stroke, leading to greater disability as well as increased mortality. The most clinically important advances, however, have been in the treatment and prevention of PSD. Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials for the treatment of PSD have demonstrated the efficacy of antidepressants. Similarly, randomized controlled trials for prevention of PSD have shown that antidepressants significantly decrease the incidence of PSD compared with placebo. Early antidepressant treatment of PSD appears to enhance both physical and cognitive recovery from stroke and might increase survival up to 10 years following stroke. There has also been progress in understanding the pathophysiology of PSD. Inflammatory processes might be associated with the onset of at least some depressive symptoms. In addition, genetic and epigenetic variations, white matter disease, cerebrovascular deregulation, altered neuroplasticity, and changes in glutamate neurotransmission might be relevant etiological factors. Further elucidation of the mechanism of PSD may ultimately lead to specific targeted treatments.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^112sdMNQ]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Stroke Rehabilitation — post-stroke depression management includes these recommendations and associated strength language: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against solution-focused psychological interventions to prevent the development of depression (Neither for nor against). We suggest against the use of antidepressants for the prevention of post-stroke depression (Weak against). We suggest a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for depression symptoms (Weak for). We suggest psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) for depression following stroke (Weak for). We suggest mindfulness-based therapies for treatment of depression following stroke (Weak for). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against acupuncture, either alone or as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, for depression following stroke (Neither for nor against). We suggest either face-to-face therapy or telerehabilitation, depending on patient characteristics and preferences (Weak for).

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113gMdnU]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Poststroke depression (PSD) is common, affecting approximately one third of stroke survivors at any one time after stroke. Individuals with PSD are at a higher risk for suboptimal recovery, recurrent vascular events, poor quality of life, and mortality. Although PSD is prevalent, uncertainty remains regarding predisposing risk factors and optimal strategies for prevention and treatment. This is the first scientific statement from the American Heart Association on the topic of PSD. Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association's Manuscript Oversight Committee. Members were assigned topics relevant to their areas of expertise and reviewed appropriate literature, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, and expert opinion. This multispecialty statement provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence and gaps in current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcomes, management, and prevention of PSD, and provides implications for clinical practice.

### Pathophysiology, assessment, and management of post-stroke cognitive impairment, depression, and fatigue [^117B29qt]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-stroke cognitive impairment, depression, and fatigue are common, persistent, and disabling. This review summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiology, assessment, and management of these debilitating neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke. We briefly review evolving knowledge on the neural mechanisms and risk factors for each condition. We describe patient-reported outcome measures and clinician rating techniques that can be used to assist in screening and comprehensive assessment. We then discuss behavioral and pharmacologic management strategies. Heterogeneity of stroke remains a challenge in management and new research is still needed to optimize and personalize treatments for stroke survivors.

- Twenty-seven inpatients participating in a stroke rehabilitation program were randomized to receive either placebo or trazodone hydrochloride beginning a mean of 44 ± 4 days after stroke. The target dosage was 200 mg/d. Patients with either a clinical diagnosis of depression or abnormal Zung depression scores showed a consistent trend toward greater improvement in Barthel activities of daily living scores with trazodone than with placebo. An abnormal dexamethasone suppression test result was associated with significant improvement in the Barthel ADL scores of patients receiving trazodone.

Stroke rehabilitation — antidepressants for prevention of post-stroke depression: Evidence included a smaller subset of eight trials (9 interventions, n = 496) reporting adverse events with no difference between pharmacotherapy and placebo in risk of death or other adverse events; the FOCUS trial (2019; n = 3,127) revealed potential risks of AD use (increased risk of falls and hip fractures) that were not measured or reported in the included studies. Treatment duration ranged from 4–52 weeks, benefits might not be demonstrated at 4 weeks because the full effect of ADs can take 4–8 weeks, and there were no follow-up studies to examine sustainability. The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low and, given potential risks that slightly outweigh benefits, the guideline states we do not recommend the universal, routine use of ADs for the prevention of post-stroke depression and We suggest against the use of antidepressants for the prevention of post-stroke depression.

Pharmacotherapy to prevent post-stroke depression — systematic review findings: An SR by Allida et al. (2020) identified 12 RCTs (n = 734), consisting of 14 interventions, with pharmacotherapy compared with placebo; the majority of participants had ischemic stroke and their mean age ranged from 55–73 years old, time since stroke ranged from three days to 3 weeks, and treatment duration ranged from 4–52 weeks. The primary outcome at the end of treatment was incidence of depression measured by meeting diagnostic criteria or scoring above a cutoff on standard scales. Analysis of the 9 pharmacological interventions (n = 734) showed those on pharmacological treatment were less likely to develop depression than placebo (RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.37–0.68, p = NR). For the secondary outcome of severity, there was no difference between groups, including no significant difference in two trials (n = 211) and no statistical difference in four studies (n = 100). The quality of the evidence was considered poor with multiple risks of bias and indirectness, and the confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low.

### Recent advances in poststroke depression [^113A5eZV]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Depression is the most common psychiatric complication after stroke. Its prevalence varies from 20% to 80%, and it is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It has significant impact on rehabilitation, motor recovery, activities of daily living, social and interpersonal life, and mortality. Several studies have shown that biological and psychosocial factors play significant roles in the development of this disabling disease. Recent research shows that neurochemical processes also may play some role in the pathophysiology of this condition. Several trials have shown evidence that the older, as well as newer antidepressants and psychostimulants may reduce/prevent depressive symptoms after stroke. At this point there are no clear guidelines available to choose safe and effective treatments. Drugs are selected based on their efficacy and side effect profile in these patients. More research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of depression after stroke. There also is a need for more randomized clinical trials to better treat patients with this condition.

### A systematic review of noninvasive brain stimulation for post-stroke depression [^113orBUg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is among the most frequent neuropsychiatric consequences of stroke, negatively affecting the patient's functional recovery and the quality of life. While pharmacological therapy has limited efficacy and important side effects, new appropriate treatments based on specific physiological mechanisms for PSD remain to be developed. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, modulating brain plasticity, might offer valid, alternative strategies.

Methods

We systematically searched four databases: MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and Web of Science, up to December 2017, using definite keywords, to identify studies on TMS and tDCS treatment for PSD.

Results

Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and the results indicate that both tDCS and rTMS are safe and have very low side effects. The reported positive results, suggesting that these methods can be considered effective therapeutic options, are questionable, and a general statement about their efficacy for PSD is premature due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous methodologies, lack of uniform diagnostic criteria, and divergent data.

Limitations

The selected articles suffer lack of information about quality of life and daily living performance measures; in addition, the number of randomized controlled trials is small.

Conclusion (S)

The aim of this review was to analyze current research in the clinical use of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) in PSD treatment in order to verify whether there are alternative perspectives in the treatment of PSD. Given the present evidence, future research is needed to address methodological limitations and evaluate the long-term efficacy of these methods, alone and in combination with pharmacological treatment.

Poststroke depression — effects of screening on outcomes: The key question is whether screening improves outcomes, and in primary care initial RCTs found little if any benefit from screening for depression; although screening improved recognition and treatment, it did not improve depressive symptoms or outcomes. Subsequent RCTs showed that depression screening combined with a collaborative care intervention — a multiprofessional approach to patient care involving a structured patient management plan and interventions, scheduled patient follow-ups, and an enhanced interprofessional communication — improved outcomes. Collaborative care for depression can include interventions from telephone calls to encourage medication compliance to intensive follow-up including structured complex psychosocial interventions.

### Depression after stroke [^115SZ5tJ]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Stroke treatment has dramatically improved in recent decades. However, although new treatments have reduced its mortality and the severity of its physical and cognitive sequelae, many people still have incapacitating disabilities following a stroke. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder following stroke; it is important to recognise and treat as it limits motor and cognitive rehabilitation. Antidepressant medication is an effective treatment and can improve adherence to clinically recommended physical and cognitive tasks, thereby enhancing functional remodelling of neuronal pathways and improving rehabilitation outcomes.

### Depression after stroke-incidence, risk factors, and mortality outcomes… [^113S38HS]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Compared with the reference population, patients with stroke had a higher incidence of depression during the first 3 months after hospitalization, which declined during the second year of follow-up. In patients with stroke, we also examined the influence of stroke subtype, lifestyle, and stroke severity. The risk of depression was 3 times lower in patients with transient ischemic attack compared with those with a stroke diagnosis. Stroke severity and current smoking were also associated with increased risk of depression after stroke, whereas alcohol consumption above the recommendations was not.

The increase in the incidence of depression within the first months after stroke diagnosis, as well as the weaker associations with acknowledged risk factors for depression and subsequent mortality, suggests that depression after stroke differs from depression arising without known prior somatic illness. There are a number of theories for the neurobiological pathogenesis of depression after stroke, with limited and conflicting evidence. 13, 24 The results from the present study do not support any particular theory. Another explanation is that the rise is owing to increased awareness of depression after stroke due to screening initiatives and prophylactic treatment with antidepressants.

The discussions of preventing depression after stroke and improving outcomes overall by initiating prophylactic antidepressant treatment soon after stroke diagnosis13 might have increased prescription of antidepressants among neurologists. 25 However, a 2013 meta-analysis26 did not provide sufficient evidence for treatment effects, and in observational studies selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment after stroke has been associated with higher mortality23, 27 independent of depression diagnosis. 23 This finding has recently been highlighted28 and might have contributed to a more conservative treatment strategy. Assuming causality, the high rates of depression in patients with stroke indicate that a large number of deaths occurring during rehabilitation may be attributable to this condition, which suggests that clinicians should remain vigilant concerning this risk, especially in patients with a history of depression and a high number of somatic comorbidities.

We suggest that future clinical studies should focus on how treatment and rehabilitation influence the risk of depression in patients with stroke.

Stroke rehabilitation — post-stroke depression management — For the prevention of post-stroke depression, there is insufficient evidence for or against the universal use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor due to the risk of fractures. We suggest offering a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for treatment of post-stroke depression. We suggest offering cognitive behavioral therapy for treatment of post-stroke depression. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against treatment with a combination of pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) for treatment of post-stroke depression.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^111zQV1P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression and other mood disorders after stroke. The 2012 Cochrane Review of SSRIs for stroke recovery demonstrated positive effects on recovery, even in people who were not depressed at randomisation. A large trial of fluoxetine for stroke recovery (fluoxetine versus placebo under supervision) has recently been published, and it is now appropriate to update the evidence.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 16 July 2018), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, July 2018), MEDLINE (1946 to July 2018), Embase (1974 to July 2018), CINAHL (1982 July 2018), PsycINFO (1985 to July 2018), AMED (1985 to July 2018), and PsycBITE March 2012 to July 2018). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke survivors at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. To be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data from each trial. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risks of bias and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified a total of 63 eligible trials recruiting 9168 participants, most of which provided data only at end of treatment and not at follow-up. There was a wide age range. About half the trials required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between trials. Only three of the included trials were at low risk of bias across the key 'Risk of bias' domains. A meta-analysis of these three trials found little or no effect of SSRI on either disability score: SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; P = 0.75; 2 studies, 2829 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or independence: RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.99; 3 studies, 3249 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We downgraded both these outcomes for imprecision. SSRIs reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.11 lower, 0.19 lower to 0.04 lower; 2 trials, 2861 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a higher observed number of gastrointestinal side effects among participants treated with SSRIs compared to placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.76; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 148 participants; moderate-quality evidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 0%). For seizures there was no evidence of a substantial difference. When we included all trials in a sensitivity analysis, irrespective of risk of bias, SSRIs appeared to reduce disability scores but not dependence. One large trial (FOCUS) dominated the results. We identified several ongoing trials, including two large trials that together will recruit more than 3000 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no reliable evidence that SSRIs should be used routinely to promote recovery after stroke. Meta-analysis of the trials at low risk of bias indicate that SSRIs do not improve recovery from stroke. We identified potential improvements in disability only in the analyses which included trials at high risk of bias. A further meta-analysis of large ongoing trials will be required to determine the generalisability of these findings.

### Pharmacological therapies in post stroke recovery: recommendations for future clinical trials [^112uCLUH]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in adults and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Early reperfusion and neuroprotection techniques have been the focus of much effort with the aim of very acute treatment of the stroke. Targeting different mechanisms, pharmacological therapies have the potential to reduce disability in a large fraction of patients who survive the acute stroke. The brain's capacity to reorganize after stroke through plasticity mechanisms can be modulated by pharmacological agents. A number of therapeutic interventions are under study, including small molecules, growth factors, and monoclonal antibodies. Recently it has been shown that the SSRI fluoxetine improved motor deficit in patients with ischaemic stroke and hemiplegia which appeared to be independent of the presence of depression. In this context, it is of major importance to support innovative research in order to promote the emergence of new pharmacological treatments targeting neurological recovery after stroke, as opposed to acute de-occlusion and neuroprotection. This paper is the work of a group of 14 scientists with aim of (1) addressing key areas of the basic and clinical aspects of human brain plasticity after stroke and potential pharmacological targets for recovery, (2) asking questions about the most appropriate characteristics of clinical trials testing drugs in post stroke recovery and (3) proposing recommendations for future clinical trials.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115v8XjQ]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — medication evidence notes that poststroke depression is treatable with a variety of antidepressant medications, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants being the most widely studied, and treatment with heterocyclic antidepressant medications and SSRIs appears to be a viable option although absolute or relative efficacy has yet to be fully established. In 1 study of 870 veterans with poststroke depression, poststroke SSRI treatment was associated with longer survival, and the authors concluded that after a stroke, SSRI initiation or resumption of treatment should be considered as part of a medication therapy management service, especially if the patient has a history of depression or was taking an SSRI before the stroke. A 2008 Cochrane review analyzing data for 13 pharmaceutical agents, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, found some benefit of pharmacotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression and improvement in scores on depression rating scales, but there was also an associated increase in adverse events. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no studies on the effectiveness of a combined drug intervention and rehabilitation intervention on recovery outcomes after stroke.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^11429yuz]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — screening and management recommendations are as follows: Administration of a structured depression inventory such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is recommended to routinely screen for poststroke depression. Patient education about stroke is recommended, and patients should be provided with information, advice, and the opportunity to talk about the impact of the illness on their lives. Patients diagnosed with poststroke depression should be treated with antidepressants in the absence of contraindications and closely monitored to verify effectiveness. A therapeutic trial of an SSRI or dextromethorphan/quinidine is reasonable for patients with emotional lability or pseudobulbar affect causing emotional distress. Periodic reassessment of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric symptoms may be useful in the care of stroke survivors, and consultation by a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist for stroke survivors with mood disorders causing persistent distress or worsening disability can be useful. The usefulness of routine use of prophylactic antidepressant medications is unclear, and combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of poststroke depression may be considered. The efficacy of individual psychotherapy alone in the treatment of poststroke depression is unclear. Patient education, counseling, and social support may be considered as components of treatment for poststroke depression. An exercise program of at least 4 weeks duration may be considered as a complementary treatment for poststroke depression, and early effective treatment of depression may have a positive effect on the rehabilitation outcome. No recommendation for the use of any particular class of antidepressants is made, and SSRIs are commonly used and generally well tolerated in this patient population.

### Depression after stroke: a review of the evidence base to inform the development of an integrated care pathway. part 2: treatment alternatives [^113Vjg4B]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a common complication of stroke, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. It can impede the process of rehabilitation, and has been associated with poorer outcomes and increased length of stay in hospital. This systematic review was undertaken as a preliminary step to the development of an evidence-based integrated care pathway (ICP) for the management of post-stroke depression (PSD) in a rehabilitation setting, and is divided into two parts. In part 1 we reviewed the frequency of depression in stroke, its impact on functional recovery and the different methods for assessment.

Aims and Objectives

In part 2, we discuss the rationale for treatment of PSD, appraise the evidence for effectiveness of the different antidepressant drugs, and consider whether we can identify a recommended first-line treatment for use in our ICP.

Methods

Data sources comprised a computer-aided search of published studies on depression in stroke and references to literature used in reviews.

Main Findings

From the few controlled trials of anti-depressant therapy in PSD, both tricyclics and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be effective, but the latter may be preferable in stroke because of their prompt action and better side-effect profiles. Within the group of SSRIs there is currently no direct evidence to guide the choice of agent. In the absence of firm guidance, sertraline was chosen on theoretical grounds as one of the most potent with minimal sedative effects and no reported interaction with warfarin. Citalopram may offer an appropriate second choice.

Conclusions

A suggested regimen for the use of sertraline in PSD was put forward. Development of an ICP may help to establish a more consistent approach to assessment and treatment of PSD, and form a basis for future comparison of different treatments as they become available.

Those taking placebo were more likely to report clinical depression (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.4–8.2) than those who participated in the problem-solving treatment (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5) and than those taking escitalopram; after discontinuation at 1 year, 4 in the escitalopram group developed new major depression symptoms, whereas no one in the placebo or problem-solving groups did.

Cerebrovascular diseases constitute a leading health hazard. The association between stroke and depression has been recognized for many years. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder associated with cerebrovascular diseases, most episodes of post-stroke depression occur in the first 2 years after a cerebrovascular accident. Studies have found an association between lesion location, physical impairment, cognitive impairment, aphasia, and post-stroke depression. The location of the lesion in terms of proximity to the left frontal pole of the brain has a profound impact on the frequency and severity of post-stroke depression. Treatment modalities include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and rehabilitation. Understanding the psychologic and physical morbidity of post-stroke depression, as well as its timely, comprehensive treatment, are important for effective management.

VA/DoD stroke rehabilitation — psychotherapy for post-stroke depression: Evidence from the 2019 VA/DoD Stroke Rehabilitation CPG suggested that psychotherapy interventions improve depressive symptoms in patients following stroke. In a systematic review by Ahrens et al. (2023) including 10 studies (n = 672), six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of computer-based or traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the duration of intervention ranged from 8–16 weeks, with a mean duration of about 10 weeks, and depression symptoms were commonly measured by the Beck Depression Inventory; CBT improved general depression symptoms immediately after intervention (SMD: 0.945; 95% CI: 0.52–1.37; p < 0.000) and at 3 months (SMD: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.097–1.46; p < 0.025). Ahrens et al. noted the studies mostly used group-based CBT, and group-based interventions had similar effect sizes as individual-based CBT interventions. Another systematic review by Allida et al. (2020) of six RCTs (n = 521) found improvement in depression prevalence (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62–0.95; p = 0.01) and depression symptoms (MD: -6.2; 95% CI: -8.24– -4.16; p < 0.001) at the end of treatment, with no difference between groups at the end of follow-up; patients were followed for up to 36 months in some studies, but only 201 patients were available at final follow-up compared with 521 immediately after treatment.

Design

A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial that compared three intervention groups, with subgroups stratified by time after stroke.

Setting

Outpatient clinic.

Subjects

Eligible patients were recruited at discharge (n = 73) and three (n = 67), six (n = 65), and nine months (n = 69) after discharge, and patients completed mood questionnaires.

Interventions

Patients were randomly distributed into three groups: Group A received placebos and participated in general discussions; Group B, received citalopram and participated in general discussions; and Group C, received placebos and underwent cognitive behavioural therapy. All three groups participated in rehabilitation during three months of follow-up.

Main Measures

Outcome was assessed three months after baseline using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD 17) and the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (MES). During treatment, the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser side-effect scale was also administered.

Results

When stratification was not considered, the scores of Group B on the Melancholia Scale were lower than those of Group A (P = 0.02); when the four time-based subgroups were analysed, significant differences were observed between Groups A and B (P MES = 0.02, P HAMD17 = 0.02) in the group recruited six months after discharge and between Groups A and C (P MES = 0.01) in the last time period nine months after discharge.

Conclusions

The effects of citalopram or cognitive behavioural therapy is similar to the effect of rehabilitation alone for early-onset post-ischaemic depression; rehabilitation and citalopram for delayed-onset post-ischaemic depression; and rehabilitation and cognitive behavioural therapy for late-onset post-ischaemic depression are more effective than rehabilitation alone.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for post-stroke depression: a meta-analysis [^111WxF4n]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used for post-stroke depression (PSD), but the findings have been inconsistent. This is a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for PSD.

Methods

Both English (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase) and Chinese (WanFang Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and SinoMed) databases were systematically searched. Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMDs/SMDs), and the risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model.

Results

Altogether 23 studies with 1,972 participants with PSD were included and analyzed. Of the 23 RCTs, 39.1% (9/23) were rated as high quality studies, while 60.9% (14/23) were rated as low quality. CBT showed positive effects on PSD compared to control groups (23 arms, SMD = -0.83, 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.60, P < 0.001). Both CBT alone (7 arms, SMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.22 to -0.29, P = 0.001) and CBT with antidepressants (14 arms, SMD = -0.95, 95% CI: -1.20 to -0.71, P < 0.00001) significantly improved depressive symptoms in PSD. CBT had significantly higher remission (6 arms, RR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37–2.25, P < 0.00001) and response rates (6 arms, RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22–1.63, P < 0.00001), with improvement in anxiety, neurological functional deficits and activities of daily living. CBT effects were associated with sample size, mean age, proportion of male subjects, baseline depression score, mean CBT duration, mean number of CBT sessions, treatment duration in each session and study quality.

Conclusion

Although this meta-analysis found positive effects of CBT on depressive symptoms in PSD, the evidence for CBT is still inconclusive due to the limitations of the included studies. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the benefits of CBT in PSD.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of post-stroke depression: results from a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial [^113jfywv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Post-stroke depression is a disabling condition occurring in about one-third of patients with stroke. Pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy and important side effects. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown efficacy in treating depression. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tDCS for post-stroke depression.

Methods

48 antidepressant-free patients with post-stroke depression were randomised into two groups (active and sham tDCS). 12 30min sessions of 2mA anodal left/cathodal right dorsolateral prefrontal tDCS were administered over 6weeks (once daily on weekdays for 2weeks, then 1 session every other week). The primary outcome was the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-items) at 6weeks. We employed a repeated-measures analysis of variance; the depression score was the dependent variable, and time and group were independent variables. In this intention-to-treat analysis, missing data were addressed according to the last observation carried forward and the mixed-model repeated-measures analysis methods.

Results

5 patients dropped out (two in the active group). Active tDCS was significantly superior to sham at end point (mean difference, 4.7 points; SD = 9.21; p < 0.001). Response and remission rates were significantly higher in the active (37.5% and 20.8%, respectively) versus the sham (4.1% and 0%, respectively) group, with a number-needed-to-treat of 3 and 5, respectively.

Conclusions

This was the first controlled study to demonstrate that tDCS was safe and effective for post-stroke depression. Therefore, tDCS might be a favourable option for treating these patients.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for stroke recovery [^116H1E2y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) associated with better recovery after stroke?

Bottom Line

SSRIs may be associated with improved recovery after stroke, even in persons without depression. However, much of the evidence is of poor quality. Large, high-quality trials are needed to evaluate the validity of the current evidence and improve precision of estimates of any treatment benefits.

Mindfulness-based therapies for post-stroke depression — We suggest mindfulness-based therapies for treatment of depression following stroke. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation; therefore, it is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The benefits of MBSR and MBCT for the treatment of post-stroke depression slightly outweigh the potential harms, and patient values and preferences varied somewhat. Implementation considerations note that MBSR and MBCT facilitator competencies require considerable experiential training; formal certification in MBSR is lengthy and expensive; other training options such as Veterans Affairs Compassionate Awareness Learning Module (VA CALM) training are available; and mobile technology applications can increase feasibility, accessibility, and acceptability.

### Stroke depression: a concept with clinical applicability [^112Jxenp]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In 'stroke depression': depression seen as a symptom not a disease

Studies suggested the estimated rate of misdiagnosis for post stroke depression is between 50% and 70%. In a recent article published in the Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine, 'depression' has already been proposed as a symptom in stroke. If depressive symptoms are identified by clinical observation or scale assessment, neurologists can start antidepressant treatment immediately. And only short-term use of antidepressants is required.

To summarise, we believe that the concept of 'stroke depression' better interprets the bidirectional relationship between stroke and depression, and is with promising clinical applicability. The concept of 'stroke depression' emphasises early comprehensive management of depression, with the aim of reducing stroke mortality, disability and recurrence. Neurologists can work collaboratively with psychiatrists to develop algorithms (figure 2). At any stage in the evolution or trajectory of a stroke, following a positive screen for depressive symptoms, interventions can initiate. Similarly, for those who have depressive symptom, there is probably no need for long-term maintenance treatment, thereby avoiding the possible side effects of long-term use of antidepressants. Intervention can be initiated at any stage of stroke when core symptoms of depression (depressed mood and/or lost of interest) are identified. And the short course of treatment also avoids the possible side effects of long-term use of antidepressants. The first-line antidepressants effective in major depressive disorder are suggested. Monotherapy starts with a small dose and increases gradually, for a total of 2 months.

### Factors associated with new-onset depression following ischemic stroke: the women's health initiative [^111dXNCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depression after stroke affects ≈1 in every 3 to 5 stroke survivors within the first 5 years after stroke 1 and is closely associated with impaired recovery 2 and increased long‐term morbidity and mortality. 3, 4 Despite more frequent use of antidepressants after stroke, 5 there has yet to be a decrease in the prevalence of poststroke depression. 1 These findings underscore that current treatments for depression are only modestly effective; limited treatment efficacy may be due to multiple factors (eg, frequency, duration, dose, and specific method of treatment). Indeed, large‐scale systematic reviews on the efficacy of treatment for depression after stroke have shown that antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms, albeit with increased side effects; meanwhile, the evidence is variable for benefits from nonpharmacological interventions such as psychotherapy. 6 Current treatments for poststroke depression are inadequate, but given existing evidence for benefit from early psychological therapy in improving mood and preventing depression, 7 the possibility remains that prevention of poststroke depression may be a more effective approach than treating depression once it has emerged. 8, 9

Predicting which patients are at highest risk for developing poststroke depression at the time of stroke is critical to determining whether early pharmacologic or psychosocial interventions can prevent stroke‐related depression. However, proposed risk and protective factors of poststroke depression only partly explain observed variation in risk. 10, 11 Therefore, a greater understanding of prestroke risk factors for new‐onset poststroke depression (NPSD), meaning first occurrence of depression after stroke in the absence of recent depression history before the stroke, is needed to isolate predisposing factors for depression that are specific to the unique psychosocial and neurophysiologic milieu of stroke as opposed to longstanding depression from factors unrelated to stroke. The study of prestroke risk factors for NPSD may be a critical missing piece, as exploration of these factors may help clarify specific risks in the setting of stroke that may be most responsive to early empiric antidepressant use or behavioral interventions 12 immediately after stroke to prevent development of poststroke depression.

Prevention of poststroke depression (PSD) using pharmacological interventions — A meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among 776 initially nondepressed stroke patients reported reduced likelihood of developing PSD with active pharmacological treatment (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.53), especially after a 1 year treatment (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.56) and with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.61). Reported side effects included nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness, with no significant differences between active treatment and placebo; tremor was significantly associated with sertraline in 1 RCT. An earlier Cochrane review including 12 placebo-controlled trials of 611 individuals found no evidence that antidepressants prevented depression after stroke, but 4 trials (401 participants) subsequently showed benefit for fluoxetine (n = 59 vs placebo n = 59), mianserin (n = 56 vs placebo n = 46), paroxetine (n = 32 vs placebo n = 32), and escitalopram (n = 59 vs placebo n = 58). In summary, 8 trials (n = 776) suggest that pharmacological treatment may be effective in preventing PSD; however, further studies are needed in more representative samples, and additional study is required to determine the optimal timing and duration of treatment.

Post-stroke depression — evidence summary for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy: Li, L. et al. (2020) found that paroxetine was superior to "routine treatment" at 4-week and 12-week follow-up in 98 patients (2 RCTs) with post-stroke depression as measured by the HAM-D, with 4-week follow-up MD: -7.64; 95% CI: -10.05 – -5.23; p < 0.0001 and 12-week follow-up MD: -9.79; 95% CI: -16.94 – -2.64; p = 0.007. Feng et al. (2022) found that escitalopram (mostly dosed at 5–10 mg per day) was superior to placebo at 1- to 12-month follow-up in 612 patients (7 RCTs) with or without depression at baseline as measured by the HAM-D and other measures at the end of treatment (SMD: -1.25; 95% CI: -1.82– -0.68; p < 0.001). Findings did not differ by depression status at baseline. Li, X. et al. (2020) performed an NMA of 15 RCTs with 5,547 patients with post-stroke depression measuring mean change in total HAM-D score after multiple antidepressants, and extensive analyses comparing SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo revealed that SSRIs and SNRIs consistently outperformed placebo at 4-week follow-up, 8-week follow-up, and end of treatment, with the mean change in HAM-D score consistently meeting the MCID for all analyses except for paroxetine at 4 weeks. These ADs included tricyclic ADs, which are not recommended for treatment of depression in the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder because of their side effect profile, and the SR data should be interpreted with caution because of missing key information such as time since stroke and past AD treatment; multiple studies did not explicitly delineate whether patients were diagnosed with depression at baseline or merely exhibited depressive symptoms. The potential benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs and the risks of untreated depression must be balanced with the potential harms, and common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nausea, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and reduced sexual desire or function.

### A systematic review of rehabilitation interventions to prevent and treat depression in post-stroke aphasia [^1124z9FD]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stepped psychological care is the delivery of routine assessment and interventions for psychological problems, including depression. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze and synthesize the evidence of rehabilitation interventions to prevent and treat depression in post-stroke aphasia and adapt the best evidence within a stepped psychological care framework.

Method

Four databases were systematically searched up to March 2017: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library.

Results

Forty-five studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Level of evidence, methodological quality and results were assessed. People with aphasia with mild depression may benefit from psychosocial-type treatments (based on 3 level ii studies with small to medium effect sizes). For those without depression, mood may be enhanced through participation in a range of interventions (based on 4 level ii studies; 1 level iii-3 study and 6 level iv studies). It is not clear which interventions may prevent depression in post-stroke aphasia. No evidence was found for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in post-stroke aphasia.

Conclusions

This study found some interventions that may improve depression outcomes for those with mild depression or without depression in post-stroke aphasia. Future research is needed to address methodological limitations and evaluate and support the translation of stepped psychological care across the continuum. Implications for Rehabilitation Stepped psychological care after stroke is a framework with levels 1 to 4 which can be used to prevent and treat depression for people with aphasia. A range of rehabilitation interventions may be beneficial to mood at level 1 for people without clinically significant depression (e.g., goal setting and achievement, psychosocial support, communication partner training and narrative therapy). People with mild symptoms of depression may benefit from interventions at level 2 (e.g., behavioral therapy, psychosocial support and problem solving). People with moderate to severe symptoms of depression require specialist mental health/behavioral services in collaboration with stroke care at levels 3 and 4 of stepped psychological care.

### Meta-analytic review of longitudinal depression severity in stroke survivors [^111Qrh6y]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression is a prevalent and debilitating condition among stroke survivors, yet it is potentially treatable and preventable. Previous meta-analyses have primarily focused on prevalence rates, and thus lacked the nuanced insights needed to optimize timing for interventions and prevention strategies. In this meta-analysis, we examined the progression of depression severity from the acute and sub-acute stages up to 36 months post-stroke.

Methods

We included only studies involving stroke survivors not undergoing treatment interventions. A multi-level meta-analysis was conducted across 41 eligible studies to assess natural changes in depression severity over time using standardized mean change. We analysed data across all timepoints and conducted sensitivity analyses on potential sources of bias, including publication bias, methodological quality, and low-powered timepoints.

Results

In the full model including all eligible studies, depression severity did not significantly change over time, and time since stroke was not a significant moderator. However, sensitivity analyses excluding studies identified as outliers revealed a small but significant overall reduction in depression severity (95% CI [-0.123–0.030]; p = 0.002), and a small increase in depression severity at 12-months post-stroke (95% CI [0.006 0.374]; p = 0.043).

Conclusions

Although the overall model did not show significant longitudinal change, sensitivity analyses revealed a potential pattern of overall improvement in depression with a small resurgence at 12 months post-stroke. The findings underscore the importance of evaluating depression in stroke survivors on a continuous scale, which demonstrates a pattern of post-stroke depression not previously observed in prevalence rates. Future studies should more closely examine the influence of continuous longitudinal post-stroke depression severity on stroke recovery.

### A record-linkage study of post-stroke primary care psychological therapy effectiveness in england [^113DZHRJ]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Main

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. There are approximately 1.3 million stroke survivors in the United Kingdom, and this number is projected to more than double by 2035, partly due to the ageing population, better survival from stroke and increasing prevalence of risk factors. It is estimated that depression affects one in three stroke survivorsand can persist for years without intervention, while anxiety affects more than one in four stroke survivors. In the first year after stroke, people who had an ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were two and four times more likely than the general population to have an incident depressive or anxiety disorder, respectively. Furthermore, post-stroke depression or anxiety have been associated with impaired functional recovery from stroke (including physical impairment and cognitive function), higher mortality, lower quality of life and higher healthcare use.

It is thus crucial to detect and treat common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety in stroke survivors to improve long-term health outcomes, cut demand on services and reduce healthcare costs. Current UK guidelines for stroke rehabilitation recommend that psychological therapies tailored to individual needs should be offered to stroke survivors. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective for reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety after stroke, but the sample sizes of the trials to date have been small (ranging from 5 to 322), and the robustness and generalizability of the findings to routine clinical practice remain uncertain.

No study to our knowledge has investigated the effectiveness of psychological therapy routinely delivered in primary care for people who have had a stroke, even though the majority of psychological interventions are provided in these settings. Despite the paucity of evidence, national stroke guidelines have recommended primary care interventions for the treatment of mild to moderate post-stroke depression and anxiety. In addition, national guidelines for stroke rehabilitation from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in Englandrecommend that new or persisting emotional difficulties are assessed and considered for referral at reviews between 6 and 12 months after a stroke. However, the extent to which this is an optimal point for psychological therapy has not been tested.

Stroke rehabilitation — post-stroke depression mindfulness-based interventions (MBSR and MBCT) efficacy and evidence quality: Comparators were usual care, waitlist control, no-treatment control, or patient education without a mindfulness component, and the mean age ranged from 51.63–64.80 years in intervention and 50.5–67.3 years in control groups; an MA demonstrated a positive main effect on self-reported depression versus controls (SMD: 0.93; 95% CI: -1.34– -0.53; p < 0.001), but three of the seven RCTs lacked a clinical baseline definition of depression, so the Work Group's recommendation is based on four RCTs (n = 315) meeting diagnostic criteria and validated measures in which pooled post-intervention depression scores were significantly lower with MBSR/MBCT than control (SMD: -1.27; 95% CI: -1.71– -0.84; p < 0.001); the confidence in the quality of evidence was very low with likely reporting bias and serious inconsistencies.

Understanding pathophysiology may aid management; PSD from biological causes could potentially respond better to pharmacological therapy, whereas PSD from psychosocial causes could respond more favorably to psychotherapy and social support interventions. Studies have shown an association between PSD and poststroke cognitive and functional deficits, indirectly suggesting a psychological reaction to these deficits.

### Heterocyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of poststroke depression [^115GYv4w]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the best current evidence on heterocyclic and serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatments of poststroke depression (PSD).

Design

A literature review using multiple databases was conducted to identify randomized, controlled trials of the treatment or prevention of PSD. Odds ratios were used to test for significant treatment response between the treatment arms for dichotomous outcomes. Continuous outcome measures were evaluated using weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.

Setting

Literature review.

Participants

Patients with stroke enrolled in the study of PSD of each selected article.

Measurements

Frequency of patients with and without depression; frequency of patients who responded to treatment.

Results

Nine articles were reviewed. Six investigated use of antidepressant therapy on treatment of PSD, and three examined the prevention of PSD. There was evidence to suggest that patients responded to treatment with antidepressants and significantly improved on depression scales, but treatment, especially with heterocyclic antidepressants, led to a significant number of dropouts due to side effects. There were insufficient data to pool the results of the prevention-based studies.

Conclusion

Treatment with heterocyclic antidepressants and SSRIs appears to be a viable option for PSD, but their absolute or relative efficacy has yet to be fully established. The effectiveness of early initiation of antidepressants in the prevention of PSD is not clear.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^117AddrJ]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

In summary, the results of the FOCUS trial show that fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after an acute stroke did not influence patients' functional outcomes but did decrease the occurrence of depression and increase the occurrence of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function. Ongoing trials and a planned individual patient data meta-analysis are needed to confirm or refute a more modest benefit, either overall or in particular subgroups, and to provide more precise estimates of any harms.

### A record-linkage study of post-stroke primary care psychological therapy effectiveness in england [^114iBrHP]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

At least one-third of stroke survivors are affected by depression or anxiety, but no large-scale studies of real-world clinical practice have assessed whether psychological therapies are beneficial for these patients. Here we show that psychological treatment is effective for stroke survivors on average, using national healthcare records from National Health Service Talking Therapies services in England, including 7,597 patients with a hospital diagnosis of stroke before attendance. Following psychological treatment, stroke survivors experienced moderate reductions in depression and large reductions in anxiety symptoms. Patients who started attending the services a year or more after a stroke were less likely to reliably recover from symptoms of depression or anxiety than those seen within six months of a stroke, irrespective of differences in baseline characteristics including age, gender, local area deprivation and symptom severity. Compared with a matched sample of patients without a stroke, stroke survivors were less likely to reliably recover and more likely to reliably deteriorate after psychological treatment, although adjusting for level of physical comorbidity attenuated these relationships. It is crucial that clinicians working with stroke survivors screen for symptoms of depression and anxiety and consider referring patients to primary care psychological therapies as early as possible.

### Interventions for preventing depression after stroke [^112A41eL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal mood is an important consequence of stroke and may affect recovery and outcome. However, depression and anxiety are often not detected or inadequately treated. This may in part be due to doubts about whether anti-depressant treatments commenced early after the onset of stroke will prevent depression and improve outcome.

Objectives

To determine if pharmaceutical or psychological interventions can prevent the onset of depression, including depressive illness and abnormal mood, and improve physical and psychological outcomes, in patients with stroke.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (June 2003). In addition we searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), CINAHL (1982 to September 2002), PsychINFO (1967 to September 2002), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to September 2002), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to September 2002), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to September 2002), and Sociofile (1974 to September 2002). Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched, and authors of known studies and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture psychotropic medications were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different types of pharmaceutical agents (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy against standard care (or attention control), in patients with a recent clinical diagnosis of stroke, where the treatment was undertaken with the explicit intention of preventing depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary analyses focussed on the proportion of patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria for depression applied in the trials at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included depression or mood scores on standard scales, disability or physical function, death, recurrent stroke, and adverse effects.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 1245 participants were included in the review. Data were available for nine trials (11 comparisons) involving different pharmaceutical agents, and three trials of psychotherapy. The time from stroke onset to entry ranged from a few hours to six months, but most patients were recruited within one month of acute stroke. The duration of treatments ranged from two weeks to one year. There was no clear effect of pharmacological therapy on the prevention of depression or on other measures. A significant improvement in mood was evident for psychotherapy, but this treatment effect was small and from a single trial. There was no effect on diagnosed depression.

Reviewers' Conclusions

This review identified a small but significant effect of psychotherapy on improving mood, but no effect of either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy on the prevention of depressive illness, disability, or other outcomes. More evidence is therefore required before any recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments to improve recovery after stroke.

### Interventions for treating depression after stroke [^111awSSR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Depressive and anxiety disorders following stroke are often undiagnosed or inadequately treated. This may reflect difficulties with the diagnosis of abnormal mood among older people with stroke-related disability, but may also reflect uncertainty about the effectiveness of such therapies in this setting.

Objectives

To determine whether pharmacological, psychological, or electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) of depression in patients with stroke can improve outcome.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2003). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), CINAHL (1982 to September 2002), PsychINFO (1967 to September 2002), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to September 2002), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to September 2002), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to September 2002), and Sociofile (1974 to September 2002). Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched, and authors of known studies and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture psychotropic medications were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different types of pharmaceutical agents with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy with standard care (or attention control), in patients with recent, clinically diagnosed, acute stroke, where treatment was explicitly intended of treat depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary analyses focussed on the prevalence of diagnosable depressive disorder at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included depression or mood scores on standard scales, disability or physical function, death, recurrent stroke, and adverse effects. We did not pool the data for summary scores. We performed meta-analysis for only some binary endpoints and data on adverse events.

Main Results

Nine trials, with 780 participants, were included in the review. Data were available for seven trials of pharmaceutical agents, and two trials of psychotherapy. There were no trials of ECT. The analyses were complicated by the lack of standardised diagnostic and outcome criteria, and differing analytic methods. There was no strong evidence of benefit of either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression following stroke. There was evidence of a reduction (improvement) in scores on depression rating scales, and an increase in the proportion of participants with anxiety at the end of follow up.

Reviewers' Conclusions

This review found no evidence to support the routine use of pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic treatment for depression after stroke. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the most appropriate management of depression following stroke.

### Management of depression after stroke: a systematic review of pharmacological therapies [^111NLefj]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although depression may affect recovery and outcome after stroke, it is often overlooked or inadequately managed, and there is uncertainty regarding the benefits of antidepressant therapy in this setting. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of antidepressants for the treatment and prevention of depression after stroke.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review using Cochrane methods of randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants for the treatment or prevention of depressive illness and "abnormal mood" after stroke. Treatment effects on physical and other outcomes were also examined.

Results

Outcome data were available for 7 treatment trials including 615 patients and 9 prevention trials including 479 patients. Because of the considerable variation in research design, trial quality, and method of reporting across studies, we did not pool all the outcome data. In the treatment trials, antidepressants reduced mood symptoms but had no clear effect on producing a remission of diagnosable depressive illness. There was no definitive evidence that antidepressants prevent depression or improve recovery after stroke.

Conclusions

There is insufficient randomized evidence to support the routine use of antidepressants for the prevention of depression or to improve recovery from stroke. Although antidepressants may improve mood in stroke patients with depression, it is unclear how clinically significant such modest effects are in patients other than those with major depression. There is a pressing need for further research to better define the role of antidepressants in stroke management.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111TbHwk]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — neuromodulation and electroconvulsive therapy: Preliminary evidence (n = 92 patients) from a small RCT suggested that noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be effective among depressed stroke patients who do not respond to a trial with antidepressants. There are no RCTs of electroconvulsive therapy in stroke survivors with PSD; however, electroconvulsive therapy has been used as a last resort to treat refractory PSD. Treatment should be started at the lowest effective energy levels, using pulsatile currents, increased spacing of treatments (2–5 days between treatments), and fewer treatments in an entire course (4–6). Nondominant unilateral electroconvulsive therapy is the preferred technique.

### Stroke depression: a concept with clinical applicability [^113SmUkZ]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

'Stroke depression': focus on 'stroke' again

In the term 'poststroke depression', neurologists focus on 'depression', whether the symptoms of 'depression' can be improved by drugs or psychotherapy, and whether the outcome of 'depression' can be adequately evaluated with scales. However, the depression that occurs after a stroke is essentially the same as the changes in blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipid levels that occur after a stroke. Taking blood pressure as an example, it is well known that post stroke blood pressure fluctuations have adverse effects on stroke, such as an increased proportion of haemorrhagic transformation in acute cerebral infarction, haematoma expansion in acute cerebral haemorrhage, aggravated atherosclerosis and increased risk of stroke recurrence. Therefore, actively stabilising blood pressure levels after stroke is not just to reduce or increase blood pressure, but more importantly, to reduce the adverse effects of blood pressure fluctuations on stroke. Similarly, the benefit of statins demonstrated by the landmark SPARCL study has now become standard protocol for risk reduction of stroke by as much as 23%. The use of statins is not aimed on the specific reduction of blood lipid levels, but rather protection of cerebral vascular vessels. Likewise, the main goal of antidepressant treatment is to restore neurological function, while reducing depressive symptoms. In the term 'stroke depression', 'stroke' has become the focus of attention, and the purpose of improving depressive symptoms is to reduce stroke mortality, disability and recurrence risk. Furthermore, since depression can occur before, during and after a stroke, it is no longer necessary to emphasise the temporal concept of 'poststroke'.

Fortunately, a number of large-scale clinical studies have shown that in addition to a significant reduction in symptoms, antidepressants can improve motor function (especially flexibility) as well as normalise cognitive deficits. Recent clinical trials also show the benefit of antidepressants in stroke patients, even in the absence of significant depressive symptoms. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, the use of antidepressants after stroke is no longer limited to improve depressive symptoms. As we suggest, early initiation of antidepressants after an acute stroke, will be as important as antiplatelet drugs and statins, in stroke prevention and treatment.

### Stroke depression: a concept with clinical applicability [^112HDZAi]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a common neurological condition and among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Depression is both a risk factor for and complication of stroke, and the two conditions may have a complex reciprocal relationship over time. However, the secondary effects of depression on stroke are often overlooked, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. In the previous concept of 'poststroke depression', stroke and depression were considered as two independent diseases. It often delays the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The concept 'stroke depression' proposed in this article will emphasise more the necessity of aggressive treatment of depression in the overall management of stroke, thus to reduce the incidence of stroke and in the meantime, improve the prognosis of stroke. Hopefully, it will lead us into a new era of acute stroke intervention.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NuoQE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Every year, about 13.7 million individuals are affected by stroke globally, and about half of the stroke survivors are suffering from disability. Two meta‐analyses estimated that the prevalence of poststroke depression among stroke survivors was 30%. Moreover, these poststroke sequelae were associated with a higher risk for subsequent stroke mortality. Despite the fact that considerable advances have been made in treating the acute form of stroke, there is a constant need to find new and improved methods of treatment. Specifically, those treatments revolve around the long‐term recovery aspect of stroke regardless of eligibility for acute treatments. Many interventions that involve monoaminergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were shown to improve the neurological deficit and disability of patients with stroke.

Several studies evaluated the role of SSRIs in several aspects of stroke recovery. However, the results of these studies were contradictory, with some studies concluding that SSRIs improved poststroke recovery, whereas others indicated that SSRIs did not provide any benefits for patients with stroke. Moreover, 2 Cochrane systematic reviews in 2012 and 2018 showed that SSRIs failed to improve poststroke recovery. However, these reviews highlighted that the included studies had several limitations and heterogeneity. In response to this conclusion, an international collaboration developed a core protocol for 3 trials of fluoxetine for recovery after stroke. The aforementioned Cochrane reviews, conducted before the development of this protocol, did not evaluate the role of SSRIs in treating mental disorders among patients with stroke and did not investigate the efficacy of each drug in the SSRIs family solely. Additionally, several trials were completed since the last Cochrane review in 2018. This necessitates a more updated systematic review and meta‐analysis that accounts for the mentioned issues; hence, we decided to conduct this study to evaluate the role of SSRIs in poststroke recovery.

### A pilot randomized controlled trial of self-help relaxation to reduce post-stroke depression [^1152TxYx]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To consider the potential of self-help relaxation training to treat depression after stroke.

Design

Randomized controlled trial with cross-over at three months.

Setting

Community.

Participants

In total, 21 people with stroke, aged 49-82years.

Intervention

Autogenic relaxation CD.

Main Measure

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (HADS-D) subscale.

Results

No difference in depression change scores was identified between the treatment and control groups; however, on two follow-ups, significant positive differences relative to screening were found for the treatment group (at 2months Z = -2.55, P = 0.011 and 12months Z = -2.44, P = 0.015). A partial η² = .07 was identified.

Conclusion

Self-help relaxation holds promise as a self-help treatment for depression after stroke. Findings from this trial, considered with others of relaxation for depression, suggest that a study including a total of 80 participants would likely be sufficient to establish efficacy of the treatment, relative to controls, in those with stroke.

### Successful use of ECT in post-stroke depression [^117H93MU]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Post-stroke depression is a potentially persistent complication of stroke. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for depression, but with limited data regarding safety in stroke patients. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of stroke and antiphospholipid syndrome, who became depressed and suicidal. Neurologic and Internal Medicine consults did not reveal any contraindications to ECT, but stroke risk factor management was identified as an important measure for patient safety. The patient tolerated ECT well, reporting improvement of mood and abatement of hopelessness. This case suggests that ECT may be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for post-stroke depression.

### Interventions for treating depression after stroke [^111Bs8yy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is an important consequence of stroke that impacts on recovery yet is often not detected or inadequately treated. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To determine whether pharmaceutical, psychological, or electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) of depression in patients with stroke can improve outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched October 2007) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched February 2008). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006) and other databases. We also searched reference lists, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts, and contacted authors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmaceutical agents with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy or ECT with standard care (or attention control), in patients with stroke, with the intention of treating depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality; three review authors extracted, cross-checked and entered data. Primary analyses were the prevalence of diagnosable depressive disorder at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included depression scores on standard scales, physical function, death, recurrent stroke and adverse effects.

Main Results

Sixteen trials (17 interventions), with 1655 participants, were included in the review. Data were available for 13 pharmaceutical agents, and four trials of psychotherapy. There were no trials of ECT. The analyses were complicated by the lack of standardised diagnostic and outcome criteria, and differing analytic methods. There was some evidence of benefit of pharmacotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression and a reduction (improvement) in scores on depression rating scales, but there was also evidence of an associated increase in adverse events. There was no evidence of benefit of psychotherapy.

Authors' Conclusions

A small but significant effect of pharmacotherapy (not psychotherapy) on treating depression and reducing depressive symptoms was found, as was a significant increase in adverse events. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.

### Response to psychosocial treatment in poststroke depression is associated with serotonin transporter polymorphisms [^111Xaai9]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The Living Well With Stroke study has demonstrated effectiveness of a brief psychosocial treatment in reducing depressive symptoms after stroke. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether key variables associated with prevalence of poststroke depression also predicted treatment response.

Methods

Response to a brief psychosocial/behavioral intervention for poststroke depression was measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Analysis of covariance models tested for interaction of potential predictor variables with treatment group on percent change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression from pre- to post-treatment as an outcome.

Results

Initial depression severity, hemispheric location, level of social support, age, gender, and antidepressant adherence did not interact with the treatment with respect to percent change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression when considered 1 at a time. Participants who carried 1 or 2 s-alleles at the 5-HTTLPR serotonin transporterpolymorphism or 1 or 2 9- or 12-repeats of the STin2 VNTR polymorphism had significantly better response to psychosocial treatment than those with no s-alleles or no 9- or 12-repeats.

Conclusions

Opposite to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the Living Well With Stroke psychotherapy intervention was most effective in 5-HTTLPR s-allele carriers and STin2VNTR 9- or 12-repeat carriers.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111nrHnY]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression (PSD) — mortality risk after stroke is elevated in pooled and cohort analyses: a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies before November 2012 (13 studies; 59 598 individuals with stroke: 6052 with PSD and 53 546 from comparison groups) reported a pooled OR of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02–1.47) and a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.02–2.26) for increased early mortality; the South London Stroke Register showed greater mortality risk with PSD (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13–1.77), with the association strongest in individuals < 65 years of age, and individuals who started SSRIs after stroke had higher mortality independently of PSD at 3 months (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.34–2.20). Adjustment for comorbidities, smoking, alcohol use, SSRI use, social support, and adherence with medications did not change these associations.

### Exercise for depressive symptoms in stroke patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GaJSo]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined the effects of structured exercise on depressive symptoms in stroke patients.

Methods

We searched for published randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of structured exercise programs (e.g. functional, resistance, or aerobic training) on depressive symptoms. The mean effect size, a 95% confidence interval (CI) and I-squared (I 2) for heterogeneity were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

Thirteen studies (n = 1022) were included in the meta-analysis. Exercise resulted in less depressive symptoms immediately after the exercise program ended, standardized mean difference = -0.13 [95% CI = -0.26, -0.01], I² = 6%, p = 0.03, but these effects were not retained with longer term follow-up. Exercise appeared to have a positive effect on depressive symptoms across both the subacute (≤ 6 months post stroke) and chronic stage of recovery (> 6 months). There was a significant effect of exercise on depressive symptoms when higher intensity studies were pooled, but not for lower intensity exercise protocols. Antidepressant medication use was not documented in the majority of studies and thus, its potential confounding interaction with exercise could not be assessed.

Conclusions

Exercise may be a potential treatment to prevent or reduce depressive symptoms in individuals with subacute and chronic stroke.

Rehabilitation of mental disorder

Post-stroke depression (PSD)

PSD is one of the common complications of a stroke, occurring at the rate of about 9% to 34%.PSD slows the recovery of the patient's impairment, reduces the quality of life and even increases the patient's mortality rate.

Assessment of PSD

While there is no consensus on the best screening method, the scales commonly used for PSD include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Scale. For patients with aphasia and cognitive impairment, the current effective depression rating scales are mainly Aphasic Depression Rating Scale (ADRS) and Visual Analog Mood Scale.

Recommendations

In the absence of contraindications, patients with PSD should receive antidepressant treatment (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence).
It is recommended to use a structural depression scale, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for routine PSD screening (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence).
ADRS is reasonable for psychological assessment of patients with PSD. A single assessment should be completed within 24 hours. It is recommended to be assessed once a week (Class IIa recommendation, Level C evidence).
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used to treat PSD (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).
For patients with emotional distress or pseudobulbar affect, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or dextromethorphan/quinidine should be considered (Class IIa recommendation, Level A evidence).
It is reasonable to provide a professional mental or psychiatrist consultation for stroke survivors with a persistent affective disorder or disability deterioration (Class IIa recommendation, Level C evidence).
Patient education, counselling services and social support may be considered as part of PSD treatment (Class IIb recommendation, Level B evidence).
It is recommended to use mindfulness decompression and mindfulness cognitive therapy for PSD (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).
Combined drugs and transcranial electromagnetic stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, exercise therapy and music therapy should be considered for the treatment of PSD (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
It is reasonable to use the Baker Anxiety Scale to assess post-stroke anxiety (Class IIa recommendation, Level C evidence).
It is recommended to use serotonin reuptake inhibitors to treat post-stroke anxiety (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).
It is recommended to use mindfulness decompression and mindfulness cognitive therapy for PSD (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence).

### Comparative efficacy of nine antidepressants in treating Chinese patients with post-stroke depression: a network meta-analysis [^114ymCVx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy ranking of antidepressants for post-stroke depression (PSD) has not been assessed thoroughly yet due to the lack of network meta-analyses with sufficiently large sample size.

Methods

Seven databases including PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, WanFang and VIP were systematically searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding nine antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, paroxetine, duloxetine, amitriptyline, doxepin, sertraline and mirtazapine) treating PSD patients. Stata 15 software and R software were utilized for statistical analyses.

Results

51 RCTs were included in this NMA. For the key efficacy outcomes, escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine and paroxetine were associated with larger reduction of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) total score compared with placebo at 2 weeks. Among the nine antidepressants, escitalopram ranked the best while amitriptyline was the least helpful. At 4 weeks, citalopram ranked higher than placebo and the other eight antidepressants. In contrast, amitriptyline and doxepin were associated with minimal reduction of HAMD score. At 8 weeks, changes in HAMD score were significantly greater in nine antidepressants groups compared to placebo group. Besides, mirtazapine ranked higher than citalopram and escitalopram. At endpoint, mirtazapine was related to the highest response rate, followed by venlafaxine and escitalopram, respectively.

Limitations

No restriction was imposed on doses of every antidepressant.

Conclusions

Escitalopram was associated with a quicker relief of depression, but mirtazapine was probably the best option when it comes to the efficacy of 8-week treatment duration. Amitriptyline and doxepin were nearly the worst choice regardless of the duration (2, 4 or 8 weeks).

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline on cerebral small vessel disease, part 2, lacunar ischaemic stroke [^117V7VCZ]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-stroke depression

In the prespecified substudyof the CATIStrial, a total of 642 patients with acute ischaemic stroke within 48 h of onset and elevated systolic BP at 7 sites of CATIS were included. Patients were randomly assigned to receive antihypertensive treatment (n = 318) or to the control group (n = 324). The primary outcome was depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ⩾ 8) at 3-month post-treatment follow-up. There were 102 lacunar stroke patients (defined according to TOAST criteria) in the antihypertensive group and 104 lacunar stroke patients in the control group. The number of events (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ⩾ 8) was slightly higher in the antihypertensive group than in the control group (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82, 2.46). There was no heterogeneity of treatment effect on post-stroke depression across stroke subtypes (p = 0.07).

In summary, there is no evidence that immediate antihypertensive treatment, compared to avoiding this intervention, may be more beneficial in patients with suspected acute lacunar ischaemic stroke than in acute ischaemic stroke patients overall, in whom the absence of benefit has already been demonstrated and reflected in guidelines, with which we concur.

Time to treatment may have an effect and varies across RCTs (6–48 h), but in trials with longer time windows analyses stratified on time to treatment are not available in patients with lacunar ischaemic stroke.

Results of the aforementioned trials may also have been diluted by the modest difference in BP reduction between the intervention and control groups in most trials.

Most RCTs excluded patients with extremely elevated systolic blood pressure (> 220 mmHg), or do not provide separate results in the subgroup in patients with lacunar ischaemic stroke and SBP > 220 mmHg.

### Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions, and their combination, for treating depression after stroke [^111WZYXB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke.

Search Methods

This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke, and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022). We contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: 1) pharmacological interventions with placebo; 2) non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; 3) psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; 4) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; 5) pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; 6) non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; 7) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; 8) pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and 9) non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from included studies. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and certainty of the evidence according to GRADE.

Main Results

We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants. Data were available for: 1) 20 comparisons; 2) nine comparisons; 3) 25 comparisons; 4) three comparisons; 5) 14 comparisons; and 6) one comparison. We found no trials for comparisons 7 to 9. Comparison 1: Pharmacological interventions Very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.002; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) at end of treatment and very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests that pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; P = 0.0002; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo. More adverse events related to the central nervous system (CNS) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; P = 0.008; 5 RCTs; 488 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; P = 0.002; 4 RCTs; 473 participants; very low-certainty evidence) were noted in the pharmacological intervention than in the placebo group. Comparison 2: Non-invasive brain stimulation Very low-certainty evidence from two trials show that non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.14; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) and the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52, 1.37; P = 0.49; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) compared to sham stimulation. Non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in no deaths. Comparison 3: Psychological therapy Very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests that psychological therapy decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; P = 0.01; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control. No trials of psychological therapy reported on the outcome inadequate response to treatment. No differences in the number of deaths or adverse events were found in the psychological therapy group compared to the usual care/attention control group. Comparison 4: Pharmacological interventions with psychological therapy No trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes. Combination therapy resulted in no deaths. Comparison 5: Pharmacological interventions with non-invasive brain stimulation Non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention reduced the number of people meeting study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; P = 0.002; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but not the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; P = 0.75; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared to pharmacological therapy alone. Very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggest no difference in deaths between this combination therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.16; P = 0.93; 487 participants) compared to pharmacological therapy intervention and sham stimulation or usual care. Comparison 6: Non-invasive brain stimulation with psychological therapy No trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression. Pharmacological intervention was associated with adverse events related to the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for post-stroke motor recovery — Recommendation 12 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to improve motor outcomes in patients with or without depression (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence cited includes an SR in non-depressed patients with subacute stroke where treatment was initiated within three weeks of stroke and SSRIs provided a significant benefit versus placebo in improving FMA scores with an average treatment difference of 17.63 points, while modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and BI scores did not show a statistically significant improvement; another SR including individuals with and without depression confirmed the same trend. Across these SRs, patient numbers were lower for FMA (n = 263 and n = 287) than for mRS (n = 6,778 and n = 5,431) or BI (n = 435 and n = 814). Regarding time of effect, only two RCTs took interim FMA evaluations, and both studies compared fluoxetine versus placebo and were 90 days in total duration.

Post-stroke depression — acupuncture and related interventions showed variable effects on HAM-D outcomes across reviews. Acupressure or auricular pressure plus AD versus AD alone showed no difference in the HAM-D response rate. A systematic review/meta-analysis (SR/MA) of 19 RCTs (n = 1,606) comparing electroacupuncture with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy with treatment for 4–12 weeks found at 4 weeks a small effect (SMD: -0.30; 95% CI: -0.58 – -0.01; p = 0.04) favoring electroacupuncture, but the CI was near 0 and no difference was seen at 6- and 8-week follow-up. A network meta-analysis (NMA) including 51 RCTs (n = 3,966) across acupuncture strategies with treatment for 4–12 weeks reported that the HAM-D response rate (greater than or equal to 25% reduction in the HAM-D total score) showed inconsistent results with no clear benefit for any particular intervention or combination of interventions.

Background and Purpose

Poststroke depression is a prevalent complication of stroke with unclear pathogenesis. The benefits of antidepressants in this context and their effects on stroke recovery other than effects on mood are not clearly defined, with some studies suggesting efficacy in improving functional outcome in both depressed and nondepressed stroke patients. We have analyzed the preclinical animal data on antidepressant treatment in focal cerebral ischemia, modeled ± depression, to help inform clinical trial design.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from experiments testing the efficacy of antidepressants versus no treatment to reduce infarct volume or improve neurobehavioral or neurogenesis outcomes in animal models of stroke. We used random-effects metaregression to test the impact of study quality and design characteristics and used trim and fill to assess publication bias.

Results

We identified 44 publications describing the effects of 22 antidepressant drugs. The median quality checklist score was 5 of a possible 10 (interquartile range, 4–7). Overall, antidepressants reduced infarct volume by 27.3% (95% confidence interval, 20.7%-33.8%) and improved neurobehavioral outcomes by 53.7% (46.4%-61.1%). There was little evidence for an effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on infarct volume. For neurobehavioral outcomes there was evidence of publication bias. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequently studied antidepressant subtype and improved neurobehavioral outcome by 51.8% (38.6%-64.9%) and increased neurogenesis by 2.2 SD (1.3–3.0).

Conclusions

In line with current clinical data and despite some limitations, antidepressant treatments seem to improve infarct volume and neurobehavioral outcome in animal models of ischemic stroke.

### Early fluoxetine treatment of post-stroke depression – a three-month double-blind placebo-controlled study with an open-label long-term follow up [^114A18Lg]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Poststroke depression is a frequent psychiatric complication after stroke that may have strong negative impact on rehabilitation therapy and functional recovery. This study was conducted to show the efficacy and safety of early treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine in post-stroke depressed patients.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study was of patients within two weeks after stroke. Moderate to severe depressed patients (determined by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) > 15, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale) were randomized to receive either 20 mg/d fluoxetine or placebo for 3 months. Beside the psychiatric assessment, patients were evaluated by use of the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS), the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE) and the Barthel-Index (BI). An open-label long-term follow up was done 18 months after the initial assessment.

Results

54 depressed patients of an inpatient population of 242 consecutive stroke patients aged 25 to 85 years entered the trial within the first two weeks post-stroke. 50 patients completed the trial per-protocol. The initial severity of depression was comparable in the two groups (mean baseline HDS score 32.8 in the fluoxetine vs. 30.3 in the placebo group), as were neurological symptom severity and demographic parameters. Significant improvement was seen in both groups within 4 weeks of treatment, whereas no advantages of fluoxetine could be observed at this time. This indicates a high degree of spontaneous recovery during early rehabilitation therapy. BDI scores of patients treated with fluoxetine further decreased until the follow-up at 12 weeks, whereas the scores increased again in the placebo group. This depressive relapse of the placebo patients after the end of most rehabilitation efforts was evident at a long-term follow-up 18 months after inclusion, when patients who had been treated with fluoxetine were significantly less depressed. No side effects of fluoxetine treatment were detected.

Conclusions

The advantages of fluoxetine were obvious at the follow-up 18 months after inclusion, but could not be demonstrated within the first three months of controlled treatment. The multitude of therapeutic efforts that take place in the early phase of rehabilitation might have facilitated spontaneous recovery from depression and might have hindered benefits of antidepressant treatment to become obvious. Fluoxetine treatment was well tolerated and safe.
