## Question

Is following PYP imaging used after starting tafamidis for cardiac amyloidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether serial technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) imaging should be used to monitor treatment response after starting tafamidis for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline positions on serial PYP for response monitoring. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of emerging evidence showing changes in PYP uptake with tafamidis. Next, I will examine mechanistic explanations and potential confounders. After that, I need to check whether any consensus statements have shifted toward allowing serial PYP in select scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline what to monitor instead, anchoring to ACC/AHA/ASE and ACC expert pathways [^1132FeDi] [^111zmePx].

> Let me first confirm the authoritative stance. The ACC/AHA/ASE expert consensus explicitly states that serial SPECT 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy is currently not recommended to assess disease progression or response to therapy, and this remains the most conservative and widely endorsed position in current practice guidance, which I should not jump past without careful justification [^111zmePx] [^1115sEim] [^112b5yY6].

> Wait, let me verify whether any high-credibility guidance has softened this stance. The ACC expert consensus decision pathway lists bone-avid scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool and emphasizes SPECT or SPECT/CT to avoid blood pool pitfalls, but it does not endorse serial PYP for routine response monitoring, reinforcing that echocardiography and CMR remain the mainstays for serial assessment in treated ATTR-CM [^1132FeDi] [^1115sEim].

> Next, I should review the emerging evidence before concluding. Several recent studies show that quantitative PYP or DPD uptake can decline after tafamidis: a prospective SPECT/CT cohort showed about a 35–39% reduction in total SUV metrics over roughly 16 months, a DPD study reported significant reductions at 6 and 12 months with survival associations for RV uptake regression, and a hereditary ATTR cohort demonstrated an early first-year drop with subsequent stability, all of which suggest biological signal that tracks with therapy rather than mere noise [^1112kaCw] [^1172iKWy] [^115jYhQC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check mechanistic plausibility and confounders. Tafamidis stabilizes the TTR tetramer, reducing new amyloid formation, and tracer uptake correlates with histologic amyloid burden, so a decline in uptake could reflect reduced ongoing deposition or altered fibril binding properties rather than mass regression, which aligns with the observation that structural echocardiography and CMR may lag or show minimal change despite tracer reductions, and with case data showing discordance between dramatic tracer decline and persistent histologic amyloid on biopsy [^111SuJqh] [^114GYzFi] [^117TmkTp] [^112FFKXT].

> I should double-check whether any consensus documents have begun to carve out a monitoring role. The ASNC/AHA/ASE appropriate use ratings for follow-up in established ATTR-CM rate serial PYP as "Rarely Appropriate" for assessing response or progression, whereas echocardiography and CMR are rated "Appropriate", indicating that even where serial PYP is not forbidden, expert panels still prioritize echo and CMR for longitudinal care, and this asymmetry should temper routine adoption of serial PYP [^111foa5Z] [^114FXRNJ].

> Let me consider the practical implications and limitations. Serial PYP adds radiation, cost, and interpretive variability, and current quantification is not standardized across centers; moreover, we lack validated thresholds linking a given percentage decline in uptake to improved hard outcomes, so using PYP to titrate therapy or declare treatment failure is premature, even though exploratory use in trials or specialized centers may generate useful hypotheses [^111zmePx] [^117JnAs9].

> But wait, what if a patient has discordant clinical and biomarker trajectories and we need more granular amyloid-specific signal. In that narrow scenario, a research-aligned, once-in-a-while quantitative PYP or DPD SPECT/CT could be considered to complement — not replace — established monitoring, provided the team understands that declining uptake likely reflects reduced new deposition or altered tracer–fibril interactions rather than proven mass regression, and that results should not override clinical judgment or guideline-based care [^111zmePx] [^117JnAs9].

> I will now examine what to monitor instead. Echocardiography remains the cornerstone for serial assessment of ventricular function and strain, while CMR with ECV is the most validated modality to track extracellular expansion and has prognostic value; biomarker trajectories, particularly NT-proBNP and troponin within validated staging systems, should anchor response assessment, and these modalities are explicitly endorsed for serial follow-up in current consensus pathways [^1115sEim] [^111zmePx] [^111foa5Z].

> In summary, I should confirm that routine serial PYP imaging is not recommended for monitoring tafamidis response, given the lack of validated prognostic links and current guideline positions; however, emerging quantitative data show consistent declines in tracer uptake with disease-modifying therapy, suggesting a biologically meaningful signal that may justify selective, hypothesis-generating use in specialized settings while we await standardization and outcome correlation studies [^111zmePx] [^1112kaCw] [^1172iKWy] [^115jYhQC].

Routine PYP imaging is **not recommended** for monitoring **tafamidis** response in ATTR-CM because it does not reliably track clinical outcomes or amyloid burden changes [^111zmePx] [^1115sEim]. PYP uptake may decline in some patients [^1112kaCw], but this does not consistently correlate with clinical improvement or survival [^116KwEiL], and serial scans are not validated for treatment monitoring [^111zmePx]. Current guidelines advise against routine serial PYP imaging; instead, monitor with clinical assessment, biomarkers (**NT-proBNP**, troponin), and echocardiography or CMR [^116KwEiL] [^1115sEim]. PYP imaging should be reserved for diagnostic purposes or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^112UcCHx] [^114Ymda7].

---

## Evidence for changes in PYP uptake with tafamidis therapy

Several studies have examined changes in PYP uptake with tafamidis:

- **Reduction in uptake**: A prospective study showed significant reductions in total SUV, SUV volume, and percentage injected dose on SPECT/CT after ~16 months of tafamidis, suggesting decreased amyloid burden [^1112kaCw].

- **Early reduction with stability**: In hereditary ATTR-CM, volumetric H/L ratio fell significantly in year 1 and remained stable thereafter, indicating early tracer reduction with sustained effect [^115jYhQC].

- **Discordant findings**: Case reports document dramatic PYP uptake decline despite persistent amyloid on biopsy, underscoring that reduced uptake may not reflect true burden reduction [^112FFKXT].

- **Limited correlation**: H/CL ratio correlates poorly with biomarkers and does not reliably predict survival, limiting its prognostic utility [^116KwEiL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus provide clear recommendations:

- **Not recommended for routine monitoring**: Serial PYP imaging is not recommended to assess disease progression or treatment response [^111zmePx] [^1115sEim].

- **Preferred modalities**: Echocardiography and CMR, including ECV mapping, are preferred for serial assessment of disease progression and response to therapy [^1115sEim] [^111zmePx].

- **Reserved use**: PYP imaging is appropriate for diagnostic purposes or when alternative diagnoses are suspected, not for routine follow-up [^1132FeDi] [^111foa5Z].

---

## Limitations and challenges of PYP imaging in monitoring tafamidis therapy

PYP imaging has several limitations for monitoring tafamidis therapy:

- **Lack of validation**: No validated standardized protocols or thresholds exist for serial PYP imaging in this context [^111zmePx].

- **Variability**: Uptake is influenced by blood pool activity, extracardiac uptake, and technical factors, complicating interpretation [^114GYzFi] [^114Vkdmv].

- **Limited correlation**: Changes in uptake do not consistently align with clinical outcomes or survival [^111zmePx].

- **Cost and availability**: Repeated imaging adds cost and may not be feasible in all centers [^1132FeDi].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities and biomarkers

Alternative modalities and biomarkers are preferred for monitoring:

| **Modality/biomarker** | **Role in monitoring tafamidis therapy** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Echocardiography | - LV function <br/> - Strain <br/> - Structural changes | High [^111gvRwp] [^111SuJqh] |
| Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) | - ECV mapping <br/> - LV mass <br/> - Functional assessment | High [^111gvRwp] [^116QNWBe] |
| NT-proBNP and troponin | - Biomarkers of cardiac stress and injury <br/> - Prognostic utility | High [^116KwEiL] |
| Serum transthyretin (TTR) levels | Potential indirect marker of TTR stabilization; limited utility | Moderate [^116VmaVP] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where PYP imaging may still be useful

Despite limitations, PYP imaging may be considered in specific scenarios:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Suspected ATTR-CM with inconclusive initial imaging or atypical presentations [^1124oTVm] [^114Ymda7].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: Suspected AL amyloidosis or other infiltrative cardiomyopathies requiring differentiation [^111csH84] [^112hmHAz].

- **Research settings**: Clinical trials or studies evaluating treatment response or disease progression [^117JnAs9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine PYP imaging is not recommended for monitoring tafamidis response in ATTR-CM because it lacks validated protocols, shows inconsistent correlation with outcomes, and is vulnerable to technical variability. Clinicians should use clinical assessment, biomarkers, and echocardiography or CMR for follow-up, reserving PYP imaging for diagnostic uncertainty or research.

Background

Cardiac imaging with bone-avid tracers for the diagnosis of transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis uses only limited quantification, but single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) acquisition can provide volumetric assessment with quantification of tracer uptake. Tafamidis is routinely used in the treatment of cardiac amyloidosis, but there are scant data on changes in imaging results during therapy. The purpose of this study was to perform a longitudinal assessment of Tc-99m-pyrophosphate (PYP) imaging to determine if tafamidis therapy results in any change in quantitative measures of tracer uptake.

Methods

The study incorporated a prospective, single-center study of ATTR patients being treated with tafamidis using Tc-99m-PYP SPECT/CT to quantify cardiac tracer uptake in the whole heart and left ventricle. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were adjusted for blood pool activity. Comparison of baseline activity was made to values obtained approximately every 6 months during treatment.

Results

Twenty-two patients (77.0 ± 7.5 years old, 86.4% male) were on tafamidis for 15.3 ± 4.0 months, with an average time between baseline and final follow-up study of 16.8 ± 4.7 months. Thirteen patients (59.1%) had multiple follow-up amyloid studies. Statistically significant reductions in total SUVs, SUV volume, and percentage of injected dose were seen. Adjusted for the maximal aortic SUV, the total SUV in the left ventricle decreased by 36.9%, the SUV volume by 38.7%, and the percentage of injected dose decreased by 34.9% (all P values ≤ 0.0001). Over the study duration, there was a decrease of 7.7%/month in the measured metrics.

Conclusion

The quantitative SUV measurements from Tc-99m-PYP SPECT/CT revealed an overall decrease in scintographic amyloid burden during the course of tafamidis therapy, but additional work is needed to determine the optimal metrics and improve the reproducibility of the quantification.

Clinical Strategies Evaluated

We evaluated a combination of strategies that could lead to the diagnosis of ATTR‐CMP. Detailed structure of the Markov model for each diagnostic strategy is shown in Figure S1. In the PYP‐based strategies, we included PYP only (strategy 1) and PYP followed by CMR when the initial study was negative (strategy 2). In the CMR‐based strategies, we included CMR followed by EMB for positive studies (strategy 3), CMR followed by PYP for positive studies (strategy 4), CMR followed by PYP for all studies (strategy 5), and CMR followed by EMB for positive studies and PYP for negative studies (strategy 6). We also included EMB all as a standalone option (strategy 7) (Figure 1). We did not include a "treat none" or "treat all" strategy in the base‐case analysis, as these do not reflect current clinical practice. However, they were considered in the supplemental analysis, where contemporary ($225 000 per year) pricing for tafamidis is considered. Invasive EMB carried a 0.03% chance of fatal complications in the base‐case analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis, varying the diagnostic performance of PYP scans to reflect a more sensitive, but less specific approach. In all strategies, a definite diagnosis of ATTR‐CMP required either histological confirmation (by EMB) or a positive PYP study. Those with true positives were assumed to undergo guideline based medical therapy for congestive HF and received tafamidis.

The tradeoffs between quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs are evaluated using incremental cost‐effectiveness analysis methods. ATTR‐CMP indicates transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; CMR, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; ICER, incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio; PYP, 99m technetium pyrophosphate; and QALY, quality‐adjusted life year.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^112KTf8T]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current study, we used estimates from the ATTR‐ACT study, a multicenter randomized trial comparing tafamidis versus placebo in patients with ATTR‐CMP, and contemporary cohorts with HFpEF, to develop a decision analytic model to evaluate a series of imaging strategies in adults over age of 65 years presenting with HF, increased LV wall thickness, and in whom amyloid light chain amyloidosis has been excluded. We used updated meta‐analyses for noninvasive test sensitivity and specificity, with invasive EMB as the gold standard to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis. Because of its dominant impact on treatment cost, we assigned a hypothetical price point of $16 000 for the cost of tafamidis, above which therapy for even known cases of ATTR‐CMP has shown not to be cost effective. In this model cohort, we found that the PYP‐only strategy was optimal based on a $100 000/QALY cost‐effectiveness threshold for the United States. The PYP‐only strategy resulted in the lowest rate of diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, lowest lifetime costs, and lowest lifetime QALYs. Strategies that incorporated use of CMR and EMB led to higher QALYs but also higher costs compared with the PYP‐only strategy. Although there is no explicit willingness to pay threshold in the United States, an American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association statement has suggested that ICERs of $50 000 to $150 000 may be considered "intermediate value". Therefore, using a higher willingness to pay threshold ($150 000/QALY), strategies involving sequential CMR and PYP could be considered cost effective. Of note, when we defined a positive PYP as the presence of grade 1 or higher cardiac uptake, reflecting a higher sensitivity but lower specificity approach, the PYP‐only strategy was no longer the most cost‐effective option.

METHODS

Model Overview

We performed a computer simulated state‐transition model that projected cardiovascular events, life expectancy, quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime health care costs for a symptomatic patient cohort at risk for ATTR‐CMP, using inputs from the ATTR‐ACT (Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial)and published literature. Our patient cohort included age > 65 years, HFpEF, as per European Society of Cardiology definition, and increased LV wall thickness (end‐diastolic wall thickness ≥ 12 mm) at initial clinical presentation. As the role of PYP imaging is limited in patients with amyloid light chain amyloidosis, we assumed that serum‐free light chain concentration and serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis would be performed before advanced imaging as discussed in an AHA scientific statement. The annual risk of clinical events depended on presence or absence of ATTR‐CMP, initiation of therapy (tafamidis), and risk of EMB. Death could occur as result of cardiovascular events, noncardiovascular events, or complications arising from invasive diagnostic procedures. Depending on the clinical diagnostic strategy, patients in the model received tafamidis therapy immediately following diagnosis or never. All patients, however, were assumed to receive routine guideline‐based medical therapy for HF, and these costs were also factored into the model. Base‐case model inputs and sensitivity analysis ranges are reported in Table 1. We will make the data, methods used in the analysis, and materials used in these models available to any researcher for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. An institutional review board approval was not applicable for this paper on cost‐effectiveness modeling as no human subject data were used.

Status and Cardiovascular Events

The demographics of the ATTR‐ACT study were used to simulate the patient population; specifically, the model population was 91% male with an average age of 74.5 years. The prevalence of ATTR‐CMP was set at 13%, reflecting a population of patients hospitalized with HF and preserved ventricular function and increased LV wall thickening. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of ATTR‐CMP for PYP was 74% (95% CI, 70%–77%) and 100% (95% CI, 99%–100%) using grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake on a radionuclide scan in patients in whom a monoclonal process has been excluded, as the definition of a positive study. We chose a high specificity threshold as it forms the basis for the current recommendations of eliminating EMB if the scan is grade 2 or3 positive and a monoclonal process has been excluded. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we used grade 1 or higher cardiac uptake as the definition of a positive study, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 97%–100%) and 68% (95% CI, 59%–77%). For CMR, we used a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI, 79%–95%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI, 86%–92%), assuming that in addition to late gadolinium enhancement the latest CMR techniques such as T1 mapping would be available. As the diagnostic gold standard of ATTR‐CMP, EMB was assumed to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. We conducted the cost‐effectiveness analyses using all‐cause mortality. Annual risk of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization for patients with HF with and without ATTR‐CMP was derived from population studies and ATTR‐ACT. In patients with amyloidosis undergoing treatment for tafamidis, we applied a hazard rate ratio of 0.70 and 0.68 for all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization, respectively. In the ATTR‐ACT trial, tafamidis was well tolerated and had a similar adverse event rate compared with placebo. Severe side effects were similar between the 2 groups, and permanent discontinuation of the study drug was more common in the placebo arm. For these reasons, we did not model any adverse quality of life effects resulting from taking tafamidis.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^1169BpfV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings were robust to plausible variation in PYP and CMR sensitivity and PYP and CMR costs. Our cost‐effectiveness results were most sensitive to PYP and CMR specificity and cost of tafamidis. Using base‐case model inputs, the PYP‐only strategy was optimal when the cost of tafamidis exceeded $13 000. High disease prevalence and low cost of treatment (< $5000–$7000 depending on prevalence) favored EMB, which is clinically intuitive, because the relative value of avoiding false negative results is increased compared with avoiding false positive results in those scenarios. CMR‐based strategies are optimal for intermediate disease prevalence and cost of treatment (between $5000 and $10 000). Finally, PYP‐based strategies were optimal with high specificity, where a positive study was defined using grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake on a radionuclide scan. These findings also underscore the need to minimize false positive PYP scan interpretation using single photon emission computed tomography and avoid interpretation of blood pool images as cardiac amyloidosis. This is of particular importance, especially when applying the technique to lower disease prevalence population.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine cost‐effectiveness of advanced imaging strategies for the diagnosis of ATTR‐CMP. Much of the previous discussion around cost‐effectiveness has revolved on the listing price of tafamidis, which currently sits at $225 000 per year. Previous work by Kazi et al. has shown that at this price, treatment of patients with confirmed ATTR‐CMP is not cost effective, with an ICER of $880 000 per QALY gained. In addition, the authors modeled that nearly all (99%) of the projected increase in annual health care spending was related to the cost of tafamidis. Despite this, initial experience suggests that clinicians are eager to treat, because ATTR‐CMP represents one of the few phenotypes of HFpEF with effective targeted therapy. Our results expand on previous studies in important ways. We extrapolated the cost‐effectiveness of multiple competing imaging strategies to identify this disease. In a simulated population of older adults with HFpEF and LV thickening, PYP only is the most cost‐effective strategy to diagnose ATTR‐CMP. Given the economic implication of a false positive finding, our results support the importance of a high specificity strategy, obviating the need for diagnostic confirmation with EMB. Furthermore, EMB as first line investigation is cost effective only at high disease prevalence and low treatment (tafamidis) cost, which is an unlikely scenario given the current listing price.

### A multicenter study of contemporary long-term tafamidis outcomes in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^116tBVry]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was an observational study conducted at 5 amyloidosis centers: Oregon Health & Science University, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Columbia University, and University of Missouri–Kansas City. The study was approved by the respective local institutional review boards. Baseline demographics, cardiac and amyloidosis history, treatment history, and outcomes were collected using prespecified definitions for each variable to homogenize data collection at all sites. In addition, data on NYHA functional class at presentation, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and loop diuretic agents (in furosemide-equivalent doses) were collected. These variables were used to calculate the National Amyloidosis Center (NAC) stage (NT-proBNP and GFR) and Columbia stage (NT-proBNP, GFR, loop diuretics dose, and NYHA functional class).

All patients who were diagnosed with ATTR-CM and started on tafamidis (meglumine 80 mg daily or acid-free 61 mg daily) between January 1, 2018, and October 15, 2021, as part of the early access program or commercial prescriptions were included. We excluded patients who underwent heart transplantation before starting tafamidis (n = 2) and patients with light-chain amyloidosis.

Patients were diagnosed with ATTR-CM if they had typical clinical and imaging (echocardiographic and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) findings in addition to 1 of the following: 1) an endomyocardial biopsy containing amyloid deposits on Congo red staining and subtype identified as transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) using mass spectrometry and/or immunohistochemistry; 2) an extracardiac biopsy confirming ATTR deposits in the setting of clear ATTR-CM phenotype; or 3) grade II or III uptake on 99m technetium pyrophosphate (99m Tc PYP) planar and single-photon emission computed tomography after ruling out cardiac light chain (AL) amyloidosis. In addition, transthyretin gene sequencing was performed whenever possible to classify ATTR-CM into wild type vs variant.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^114ii8fE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR‐CMP) is an increasingly recognized and treatable cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Multimodality cardiac imaging is recommended for ATTR‐CMP diagnosis, but its cost‐effectiveness in current clinical practice has not been well studied.

Methods and Results

Using a microsimulation model, we compared the cost‐effectiveness of a combination of strategies involving 99m technetium pyrophosphate (PYP), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of ATTR‐CMP. We developed a decision analytic model to project health care costs and lifetime quality‐adjusted life years for symptomatic, older patients who present with congestive heart failure, with an increased left ventricular wall thickness and a 13% prevalence of ATTR‐CMP. Rates of clinical events, costs, and quality‐of‐life values were estimated from published literature. The analysis was conducted from a US health care system perspective with health and cost outcomes discounted annually at 3%.

In the base‐case scenario, using a fixed tafamidis price of $16 000 annually (previously identified cost‐effective price), total health care costs per person were lowest for the PYP‐only strategy ($209 415) and highest for endomyocardial biopsy strategy ($215 881). Of the 7 strategies examined, the PYP‐only strategy had the highest net monetary benefit using a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100 000/quality‐adjusted life year. Results were sensitive to variations in model inputs for PYP and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging specificity, cost of tafamidis, and willingness‐to‐pay thresholds.

Conclusions

Our model‐based analyses showed that a PYP‐only strategy to diagnose ATTR‐CMP is the most cost‐effective strategy, at willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100 000/quality‐adjusted life year. At higher threshold ($150 000/quality‐adjusted life year), sequential tests involving PYP and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be considered cost effective.

### A case of disappearing amyloid on technetium pyrophosphate scan [^112FFKXT]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Technetium-99mm pyrophosphate (Tc-PYP) scintigraphy is a highly accurate non-invasive method for the diagnosis of transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis. Prognosis for this disease is improved following treatment with the transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer tafamidis. Although tafamidis slows disease progression, its effects on myocardial amyloid and Tc-PYP uptake remain unclear. We present a patient with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis who had a strongly positive initial Tc-PYP scan, with a dramatic decrease in Tc-PYP uptake on repeat scan after 3 years of tafamidis treatment. However, myocardial biopsy showed persistent diffuse amyloid deposits. This case highlights the need for further studies regarding the utility of serial Tc-PYP scans in monitoring the progress of ATTR cardiomyopathy.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: the "Tipping point" has been reached [^115pp6Kb]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the field of amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, once the only question was "high-dose alkylator or low-dose alkylator?" However, newer chemotherapies, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies were developed with dramatic improvements in outcomes. The most important advance was the immunotherapy daratumumab, which led to the first ever drug approval for AL amyloidosis in early 2021. All of a sudden, complete or near-complete control of the clonal process leading to light chain amyloid deposition seemed achievable for most patients — a fantasy just 10–15 years earlier.

But nothing matched the evolution of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis from the "disease I've never heard of" to "now that I know what to look for, I'm diagnosing multiple patients per year" territory for many clinicians. This occurred for 2 primary reasons:
1 Clinical trials began, backed by robust science. Even the availability of trials raised the stakes for making a diagnosis. Once the landmark ATTR-ACT (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy) trial reported an overwhelmingly positive result, the race to make a diagnosis was on. Suddenly, there was much which could be done for patients if a diagnosis was made, and amyloidosis specialists, physician organizations, advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies now had the motivation and resources to educate the medical community about the disease.
2 Simultaneously — and coincidentally from a timing perspective — bone scintigraphy (technetium pyrophosphate or "PYP" scans) was proven to be a reliable method of making a noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis for most patients. This simple, inexpensive, widely available test meant that no longer was endomyocardial biopsy required — opening up a realistic diagnostic path for most patients where none had existed before.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^113dPx1h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, ATTR‐CMP is an increasingly recognized and treatable cause of HFpEF. Numerous noninvasive diagnostic techniques are available to enable accurate diagnosis. At current pricing of tafamidis, no diagnostic strategy can be considered cost effective. When discounting the pricing of tafamidis, our model‐based analyses showed that a PYP‐only strategy, with a focus on high specificity, is the most cost‐effective strategy to diagnose ATTR‐CMP, at currently demonstrated cost‐effective pricing of drug therapy.

### Effects of tafamidis on serial [Tc] Tc-DPD scintigraphy in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^1172iKWy]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This single-center study is the first to investigate the effects of 6 and 12 months of tafamidis treatment on cardiac [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake in ATTR-CM. In parallel, the treatment effects on clinical parameters, cardiac biomarkers, and outcome were analyzed.

The key findings of our study were that treatment with tafamidis showed:
(i) A significant reduction in planar (Perugini score) and (semi-)quantitative cardiac tracer uptake at 6 and 12 months.
(ii) A significant improvement in clinical status and a notable decrease in NT-proBNP levels beginning already at 6 months and continuing at 12 months.
(iii) An association between the longitudinal reduction in quantitative RV tracer uptake at 12 months and improved patient long-term survival.

[99m Tc]Tc-DPD scintigraphy yields exceptional diagnostic accuracy in the recognition of ATTR-CM. However, the clinical and prognostic relevance of serial [99m Tc]Tc-DPD scintigraphy in ATTR-CM remained unclear. In our study, significant declines in the Perugini scoring on planar imaging were documented at 6 and 12 months, which were mirrored by (semi-)quantitative tracer regression on SPECT/CT in tafamidis-treated ATTRwt-CM patients. This was paralleled by marked clinical improvements and a decrease in cardiac biomarkers.

A recent clinical follow-up study involving 40 patients with ATTRwt-CM, who underwent [99m Tc]Tc-DPD imaging at baseline and after 9 months of tafamidis treatment, recorded marked reductions in quantitative [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake. These were accompanied by clinical improvements, proposing serial scintigraphic imaging to be a valuable tool for monitoring treatment response. The same study group also investigated the impact of the small interfering RNA patisiran on scintigraphic tracer uptake in ATTRv-CM and found similar reductions in quantitative myocardial uptake compared to the tafamidis treated ATTRwt-CM cohort. Recently, data were reported from the NEURO-TTRansform trial, which included patients with ATTRv-CM receiving eplontersen. In a placebo-controlled setting, treatment with eplontersen led to a significant reduction in semiquantitative [99m Tc]Tc-Pyrophosphat (PYP) uptake. The study authors highlighted the potential utility of [99m Tc]Tc-PYP SPECT/CT for monitoring treatment efficacy and non-invasively assessing cardiac amyloid burden.

### The association of cardiac biomarkers, the intensity of Tc99 pyrophosphate uptake, and survival in patients evaluated for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in the early therapeutics era [^116KwEiL]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure. Given the expansion of noninvasive diagnosis with 99m Tc-pyrophosphate (99m Tc-PYP) scanning, and clinical use of the transthyretin stabilizer, tafamidis, we sought to examine the interplay of planar imaging heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio, cardiac biomarkers, and survival probability in a contemporary cohort of patients referred for noninvasive evaluation of ATTR-CM.

Methods

This single-center retrospective cohort study included 351 consecutive patients who underwent a standardized imaging protocol with 99m Tc-PYP scanning for the evaluation of ATTR-CM from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2020. After the exclusion of light chain amyloidosis, patients were characterized as scan consistent with ATTR (+ATTR-CM) or scan not consistent with ATTR (-ATTR-CM) using current guidelines. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between biomarkers and H/CL and univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the probability of transplant-free survival.

Results

We included 318 patients in the analysis (n = 86 patients +ATTR-CM; n = 232 patients -ATTR-CM). The median follow-up time was 20.1 months. During the study period, 67% of +ATTR-CM patients received tafamidis (median treatment duration, 17 months). The median H/CL ratio was 1.58 (interquartile range, 1.40–1.75). An H/CL ratio of more than 1.6 or less than 1.6 did not seem to have an impact on survival probability in +ATTR-CM patients (P = .30; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–1.41). Cardiac biomarkers were poorly correlated with H/CL (troponin T, R 2 = 0.024; N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, R 2 = 0.023). The Gillmore staging system predicted survival probability in +ATTR-CM as well as in the entire cohort referred for scanning. There was a trend toward longer survival among those who were -ATTR-CM compared with +ATTR-CM (P = .051; hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–1.00).

Conclusions

At a large referral center, the intensity of 99m Tc-PYP uptake (H/CL ratio) has neither correlation with cardiac biomarker concentrations nor prognostic usefulness in an analysis of intermediate term outcomes in the early therapeutics era. The H/CL ratio has diagnostic value, but offers little prognostic value in patients with ATTR-CM. Established staging schema were predictive of survival in this contemporary cohort, re-emphasizing the importance of cardiac biomarkers and renal function in assessing disease severity and prognosis.

### Feasibility of PiB positron emission tomography / computed tomography for treatment monitoring with tafamidis in a patient with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^111qJgWd]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We present a 77-year-old woman with wild-type ATTR cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) who presented with dyspnea, arrhythmia, and elevated NT-pro BNP. Initial imaging including cardiac MRI, PYP scintigraphy, PiB PET/CT and NaF PET/CT revealed cardiac abnormalities. Tafamidis treatment was initiated. After 14 months, symptomatic improvement and reduced NT-pro BNP were observed. Cardiac MRI and PYP scintigraphy showed no significant change and increased NaF accumulation, while PiB PET/CT showed decreased amyloid deposition, suggesting that it may be superior to NaF PET/CT in assessing the therapeutic effect of tafamidis in ATTR-CA.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^1171irce]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CMP) is an increasingly recognized and treatable cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Multimodality cardiac imaging is recommended for ATTR-CMP diagnosis, but its cost-effectiveness in current clinical practice has not been well studied. Methods and Results Using a microsimulation model, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a combination of strategies involving 99m technetium pyrophosphate (PYP), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of ATTR-CMP. We developed a decision analytic model to project health care costs and lifetime quality-adjusted life years for symptomatic, older patients who present with congestive heart failure, with an increased left ventricular wall thickness and a 13% prevalence of ATTR-CMP. Rates of clinical events, costs, and quality-of-life values were estimated from published literature. The analysis was conducted from a US health care system perspective with health and cost outcomes discounted annually at 3%. In the base-case scenario, using a fixed tafamidis price of $16000 annually (previously identified cost-effective price), total health care costs per person were lowest for the PYP-only strategy ($209415) and highest for endomyocardial biopsy strategy ($215881). Of the 7 strategies examined, the PYP-only strategy had the highest net monetary benefit using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/quality-adjusted life year. Results were sensitive to variations in model inputs for PYP and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging specificity, cost of tafamidis, and willingness-to-pay thresholds. Conclusions Our model-based analyses showed that a PYP-only strategy to diagnose ATTR-CMP is the most cost-effective strategy, at willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/quality-adjusted life year. At higher threshold ($150000/quality-adjusted life year), sequential tests involving PYP and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be considered cost effective.

### Impact of tafamidis on [Tc] Tc-pyrophosphate scintigraphy in ala97Ser hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: significant initial reduction with stable long-term effects [^115jYhQC]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tafamidis has shown potential in slowing disease progression in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). This study aimed to evaluate serial changes on [99m Tc]Tc-pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy during tafamidis treatment for hereditary ATTR-CM.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of Ala97Ser (A97S) hereditary ATTR-CM patients treated with tafamidis (61 mg/day) and a control group comprising A97S hereditary ATTR-CM patients who had not received disease-modifying medications. The tafamidis group was further divided into two cohorts: cohort A received [99m Tc]Tc-PYP SPECT/CT scans at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years; cohort B at baseline, 2 years, and 3 years. Visual score, planar heart to contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio, and volumetric heart to lung (H/L) ratio were measured.

Results

Nineteen patients were enrolled in the tafamidis group and nine in the control group. After 2 years of follow-up, a significant decrease in volumetric H/L ratio (3.86 ± 0.91 to 3.01 ± 0.19, p < 0.001) was noted in the tafamidis group, while there was no significant change in the control group. When evaluated over time, a significant decrease in volumetric H/L ratio was observed during the first year of tafamidis treatment (3.75 ± 0.37 to 2.82 ± 0.15, p = 0.004), followed by stable [99m Tc]Tc-PYP uptake in the subsequent two years (2.82 ± 0.15 to 2.83 ± 0.18, p = 0.934 and 3.20 ± 0.14 to 3.09 ± 0.16, p = 0.404, respectively).

Conclusion

A significant reduction in [99m Tc]Tc-PYP uptake was observed in hereditary ATTR-CM patients after tafamidis treatment, particularly within the first year. While the effect appeared to be sustained, stable [99m Tc]Tc-PYP uptake without further significant reductions was observed in the subsequent years.

Two‐way sensitivity analysis.

Probability of having ATTR‐CMP and cost of tafamidis, assuming willingness‐to‐pay for health of $100 000/QALY. ATTR‐CMP indicates transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; CMR, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; PYP, 99m technetium pyrophosphate; and QALY, quality‐adjusted life year.

Figure 3 shows the cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve results for the PSA. The PYP‐only strategy (strategy 1) was most likely to be optimal in the PSA using willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $50 000/QALY or lower (optimal in 66%–97% of PSA iterations). As the willingness‐to‐pay threshold increased to $100 000/QALY, the probability that the EMB only strategy (strategy 7) increased to 38% (with strategy 1 being optimal in 55% of iterations at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100 000/QALY). At willingness‐to‐pay thresholds greater than $150 000/QALY, the EMB‐only strategy (strategy 7) and the PYP‐only strategy (strategy 1) have similar percentage chances of being optimal in the PSA (46%–49% for each strategy). No other strategy had a percentage change of being optimal of higher than 5% between willingness‐to‐pay thresholds between $50 000–$150 000/QALY.

### ATTR cardiomyopathy meets multiple Myeloma: the importance of cardiac biopsy [^1168X45P]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

When a patient has multiple red flags for CA, this should prompt noninvasive testing to screen for AL amyloidosis with serum free light chain ratio and serum/urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. If this screen is negative, a 99m technetium-pyrophosphate bone scintigraphy scan (PYP scan) can be used as a noninvasive tool to diagnose ATTR-CM. If any of these initial screening tests are abnormal, however, PYP scan is contraindicated and should not be used to make the diagnosis of ATTR-CM; cardiac biopsy is recommended instead. Of note, in patients with kidney disease, mild elevations in the kappa/lambda ratio are common, and a kappa/lambda ratio up to 2.5 can typically be considered normal in the setting of a normal serum/urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. One study analyzed 857 patients with histologically proven amyloid and demonstrated that bone scintigraphy scans had a > 99% sensitivity and 86% specificity for ATTR-CM, with false positives almost exclusively from uptake in patients with AL-CA.

Our patient was older than 65 years and had 5 red flag signs for CA, but the PYP scan was deferred because it was contraindicated in the setting of known MM and abnormal serum free light chains. Given this, we elected to proceed with endomyocardial biopsy to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Cardiac biopsy plays an essential role in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CA because accurate subtyping has significant implications in management and prognosis. Our patient was treated with chemotherapy and ASCT for MM and possible AL-CA, given the poor overall survival if AL-CA is left untreated. Without confirmatory testing with cardiac biopsy, this therapy would have been insufficient to treat his CA, because mass spectrometry revealed the subtype as ATTR-CM. After the patient's diagnosis of ATTR-CM, he was started on tafamidis, which has shown to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization in ATTR-CM; it also significantly attenuates the decline in functional capacity (measured by 6-minute walk test) and quality of life (as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score).

### Use of technetium-99m-pyrophosphate single-photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography in monitoring therapeutic changes of eplontersen in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111gnJqK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The study obtained approval from the institutional review board of National Taiwan University Hospital (number 201912120MSA, 202208006RIND), and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Data supporting the findings of this study are accessible from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Patient Population

Patients with confirmed hATTR‐CM who received pretherapeutic and follow‐up 99m Tc‐PYP SPECT/CT at National Taiwan University Hospital over a 3‐year period between July 2019 and October 2022 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively collected cohort.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with heart failure symptoms or evidence of amyloid cardiomyopathy on the basis of noninvasive diagnostic criteria (end‐diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness > 12 mm without another cause of hypertrophy), and (2) a pretherapeutic 99m Tc‐PYP scan demonstrating myocardial enhancement with a visual score ≥ 2, a planar H/CL ratio ≥ 1.3, and the exclusion of light chain disease. The exclusion criteria were (1) patients who died or were lost to follow‐up within 1 year and (2) patients without complete baseline and follow‐up 99m Tc‐PYP planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

Participants in NEURO‐TTRansform (NCT04136184; EudraCT:2019‐001698‐10), an international, open‐label, phase 3 study, who met the inclusion criteria were identified as the eplontersen group. Patients with hATTR‐CM who met the above inclusion criteria but were not enrolled in the NEURO‐TTRansform study and did not receive tafamidis, patisiran, inotersen, or eplontersen were retrospectively identified as the control group. All patients were enrolled before 99m Tc‐PYP SPECT/CT imaging analysis.

Correlations with and the progression of NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) (Pfizer, New York, NY) concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate, estimated with the 4‐variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation, were investigated for comparison. Both at the time of diagnosis and during serial measurements, these 2 independent biomarkers show a correlation with survival outcomes in patients with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis.

### AHL amyloidosis mimicking transthyretin amyloidosis on cardiac Tc-99 M pyrophosphate scan: a diagnostic challenge [^111DugWp]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Amyloidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction. When cardiac amyloidosis is suspected, it is essential to screen for light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), the two most common subtypes.

Case Presentation

We report a patient with advanced heart failure and mild kidney dysfunction as initial symptoms. Preliminary testing revealed a slightly abnormal light chain ratio and a strong positive Tc-99 m pyrophosphate (PYP) scan. Biopsies of the heart, bone marrow, and kidney confirmed amyloidosis. Further immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry analysis identified immunoglobulin G and lambda light chain deposits. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and heavy and light chain amyloidosis (AHL) and initiated treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, rather than tafamidis, an oral transthyretin kinetic stabilizer used for ATTR.

Conclusions

AHL amyloidosis is a rare subtype. This case demonstrates that a positive PYP scan, even with intense uptake, is not entirely specific for ATTR. Tissue confirmation is essential for a definitive diagnosis, particularly when light chain disease or other rare forms are suspected, because AL/AHL and ATTR have distinct treatments and prognoses and may coexist.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^111tqcZK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

ATTR‐CMP is an increasingly recognizedand treatablecause of HFpEF, particularly in older adults. Accurate and early detection of cardiac amyloidosis at a stage where novel therapies are most effective remains a challenge. Multimodality imaging occupies a growing role in the diagnostic algorithmand can diagnose ATTR‐CMP without EMB. In patients with symptomatic HF, contemporary expert consensus considers use of imaging including echocardiography, PYP scan, and CMR as "appropriate" for screening ATTR‐CMP. Data on the cost‐effectiveness of various multimodality imaging algorithms compared with the gold standard, EMB, remain however limited.

Patients with ATTR‐CMP diagnosed by bone avid radiotracer cardiac scintigraphy were eligible for participation in clinical trials of novel targeted treatments for transthyretin amyloidosis. Tafamidis, now Food and Drug Administration approved, has been proven to slow the progression of ATTR‐CMPbut has also been shown to be prohibitively expensive in a prior cost‐effectiveness analysis at current listing price of $225 000/year. There are several other agents undergoing phase III trials for the treatment of ATTR‐CMP, some of which have been approved for the familial polyneuropathy form of ATTR, at an even higher cost than tafamidis.

### Effects of tafamidis on serial [Tc] Tc-DPD scintigraphy in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^114GYzFi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The exact mechanism behind the binding of [99m Tc]-labeled bone tracers to ATTR in the heart remains unclear. Therefore, the mechanism behind the reduction in cardiac tracer uptake over time with disease-specific therapy remains speculative. One possible explanation is that the treatment-induced inhibition of the ATTR tetramer dissociation leads to an actual reduction in myocardial amyloid load. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that there is a positive correlation between histologic amyloid load in endomyocardial biopsies and cardiac [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake as we have recently shown. This finding was corroborated by another study demonstrating an association between cardiac [99m Tc]Tc-PYP uptake and histological amyloid load, suggesting that [99m Tc]-labeled bone tracers may indeed reflect true amyloid burden in ATTR-CM. However, due to different dynamics and kinetics of [99m Tc]Tc-DPD binding to bones, skeletal muscles, and hearts of ATTR-CM patients caution was previously advised when interpreting changes in cardiac tracer uptake, particularly with [99m Tc]Tc-DPD. Changes in uptake in any of these three compartments may affect the calculation of cardiac tracer uptake. Soft tissue uptake, primarily in planar imaging can confound results but can be overcome with additional SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT is therefore crucial for identification of true cardiac tracer uptake. Another hypothesis suggests that disease-modifying therapy induces the replacement of amyloid deposits by fibrosis. This could explain the discrepancy between the lack of structural improvements in TTE, as shown in our study, and in CMR, as shown by others, but reduced tracer uptake on [99m Tc]Tc-DPD scintigraphy. This inconsistency emphasizes the need for future studies to establish the extent to which [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake reflects myocardial amyloid burden.

An association between baseline [99m Tc]-labeled bone scintigraphy and outcome has been suggested in previous studies. We found a significant correlation between [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake regression at 12 months and patient outcome. In particular, regression in right ventricular [99m Tc]Tc-DPD uptake at 12 months was associated with improved long-term survival. However, considering the small sample size of our study cohort, further studies are needed to reevaluate the prognostic relevance of longitudinal tracer regression.

### Aging, aortic stenosis, and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis: a perfect cardiac storm? [^1177V9H7]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Considering that isolated valvular ATTR-CA is more common and exists by itself or precedes involvement of the myocardium, early initiation of disease-modifying agents such as tafamidis may be considered in these patients. Also, this study brings up an important question as to whether early surgical intervention in these patients can potentially delay the progression of the disease process. Mortality in patients with coexisting disease seems to be driven by ATTR-CA and was not mitigated by valvular interventions. Recent studies with improved screening tools for ATTR-CA show better outcomes with valve intervention. Hence, aortic valve replacement should be considered in symptomatic patients with ATTR-CA who have evidence of severe AS.

In conclusion, early diagnosis facilitated by advanced, multimodality imaging can allow treatment to be offered at an earlier disease stage of ATTR-CA and severe AS. Patients with dual disease beyond AVR for severe AS can also be treated with therapeutics for ATTR-CA. Singal et al showed that in an elderly Indian population, the coexistence of cardiac amyloidosis and severe aortic stenosis is not uncommon, as detected by PYP imaging (9.4%). They also demonstrated that there is a high prevalence of isolated valvular amyloidosis in patients with severe AS, the significance of which remains unknown. Larger dual disease studies will help to understand whether isolated valvular amyloidosis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality; valve and/or amyloid specific therapies and valvular interventions may benefit patients with concomitant disease and can potentially calm the perfect storm.

Results

A total of 624 patients with ATTR-CM who received tafamidis were included (Table 1). The mean age was 76.9 ± 8.4 years, 546 (87.5%) were male, and 17.5% were Black. NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms were present in 216 patients (34.7%), and the median (Q1-Q3) NT-proBNP level was 1,911 pg/mL (960.5–3,909.0 pg/mL). The majority of patients (79.8%, n = 498) were diagnosed using 99m Tc PYP scintigraphy. There were 109 patients (17.5%) with a documented variant on transthyretin gene sequencing and were classified as variant ATTR-CM; their baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The 2 most common variants were V122I (12.3%) and T60A (2.4%). The distribution of patients according to NYHA functional class, NAC stages, and Columbia stages is shown in Table 1.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^117X1QE5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A few limitations of our study deserve mention. Our study strategy evaluated older patients, with HF and increased LV wall thickness in whom amyloid light chain amyloidosis has been excluded. As such, it does not directly apply as a screening strategy in all patients with HF. Second, because of its reliance on simulation models, we required the combination of inputs from various sources to perform the cost‐effectiveness analyses. Despite this, our sensitivity analyses showed that our findings were consistent across plausible changes in most model inputs. Our PSA results are likely an underestimate of model uncertain owing to leaving out certain model inputs because of data availability issues. However, none of the inputs excluded from the PSA (eg, background mortality or costs) were found to be important drivers of model results in one‐way sensitivity analyses. Third, the sensitivity and specificity of PYP and CMR were derived from different patient cohort, as there has been limited direct comparative data between CMR and PYP for ATTR‐CMP. Fourth, our model was focused on diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis alone. It did not take into account the possibility of detecting (or treating) alternative causes of HF, which is a unique strength of CMR. It also does not factor in the downstream testing and cost associated with identification of a monoclonal gammopathy, which could prompt further evaluation for AL amyloidosis or myeloma. Finally, our model was designed to compare cost‐effectiveness of various diagnostic strategies for ATTR‐CMP. It relied on the assumption of a hypothetical price point of $16 000 for the cost of tafamidis, which is well below the current listing price of $225 000. As such, it actually minimizes the negative financial impact of a false positive. At current pricing, a high specificity strategy is therefore even more crucial from a cost‐effectiveness perspective.

### Evaluating the performance and potential bias of predictive models for detection of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^1174PzoH]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board approved this study. This paper adheres to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis - Artificial Intelligence (TRIPOD-AI) guidance for reporting of clinical prediction models (See Supplemental Checklist).

Data source and participants

To identify patients with ATTR-CM, we first searched the Northwestern Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) for patients with at least 1 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for amyloidosis, a pyrophosphate (PYP) scan, or medication order for tafamidis from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2022. For these patients, we performed a review of their records to confirm diagnosis of ATTR-CM, defined as either positive endomyocardial biopsy or PYP scan with a final reading of "strongly suggestive" and absence of serum evidence of amyloid light chain amyloidosis or negative bone marrow biopsy result. For a subset of patients with potential ATTR-CM based on our screening criteria but without available definitive testing in the NMEDW, we used data from the Northwestern Medicine Cardiac Amyloidosis Program registry (August 2018 to December 2022), which included the results of endomyocardial biopsies or PYP scans performed outside of the Northwestern Medicine system.

### Use of technetium-99m-pyrophosphate single-photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography in monitoring therapeutic changes of eplontersen in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^116zqDaF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare systemic disorder resulting from autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding transthyretin. The continuous deposition and accumulation of amyloid in multiple organ systems result in the progressive development of peripheral polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The presence of cardiomyopathy is associated with a worse prognosis, underscoring the significance of early diagnosis, timely treatment initiation, and diligent monitoring of treatment response of hATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM).

Technetium‐99m‐pyrophosphate (99m Tc‐PYP) scintigraphy stands out as 1 of the most frequently used imaging modalities, offering accurate diagnosis of ATTR‐CM and thereby eliminating the necessity for an invasive cardiac biopsy. Emerging evidence suggests that bone scintigraphy can also be used to monitor the efficacy of ATTR‐CM treatment. A 2‐dimensional imaging approach to interpret pyrophosphate images using visual score, and planar heart and contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio can be influenced by blood pooling and rib activity. Therefore, volumetric calculation of heart to lung (H/L) ratio with single‐photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was introduced to overcome these shortcomings. In our prior study, we explored the impact of 99m Tc‐PYP SPECT/CT in patients with A97S hATTR‐CM undergoing tafamidis treatment. Our findings revealed a noteworthy reduction in 99m Tc‐PYP cardiac uptake among patients treated with tafamidis. In addition, visual score, planar H/CL ratio, and volumetric H/L ratio all exhibited significant decreases after an average 19 months of tafamidis treatment.

Although many studies have focused on the effects of tafamidis on patients with ATTR-CM, a universally standardized protocol to monitor treatment response has not yet been established. In addition, small sample sizes and inconsistent use of parameters have been prominent limitations of these studies. Even though ATTR-ACT has provided beneficial evidence in hard outcomes, the efficacies of tafamidis on other imaging outcomes remained unknown. Consequently, further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of tafamidis on cardiac remodeling compared to the natural course of ATTR-CM. The aim of this study was therefore to systemically elucidate how tafamidis treatment alters cardiac tissue characterization and translates to clinical manifestations in patients with ATTR-CM.

### Recent advances and current dilemmas in the diagnosis and management of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^114ohYVd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The development and approval of multiple agents that stabilize or prevent production of transthyretin protein has greatly improved outcomes in both hereditary transthyretin polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Over the same period, diagnostics in the field of CA have also substantially improved. Echocardiography, CMR, and Tc‐PyP have become established tools in the diagnosis and management of CA. Novel cardiac imaging techniques including myocardial PET may also have an evolving role in CA. Hopefully in the future, we will have a better understanding of how each of the biomarkers and cardiac imaging modalities can best complement each other in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of treatment in ATTR‐CM. While it is difficult to imagine how the speed of recent monumental gains made in the field of ATTR‐CM could be matched in the future, with an increasing number of new drugs in development as well as novel applications of cardiac imaging and biomarkers, the future appears similarly promising. With the inclusion of more precise strategies for the diagnosis, prognostication, and management of ATTR‐CM, we are poised for dramatic alterations to the care of these patients.

Management — cardiac amyloidosis imaging for monitoring disease progression and therapy response: Echocardiography remains the cornerstone for serial assessment in heart failure, but there is relatively little information regarding assessment of disease progression and response, and emerging data suggest that left ventricular global longitudinal strain may be a marker. Positron emission tomography (PET) is inherently more sensitive and quantitative and holds the possibility of monitoring response once adequately studied, while the quantitative nature of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) makes it a promising tool to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. However, none of the imaging techniques have been validated for assessing response to therapy, and no study has correlated changes in imaging findings after therapy with survival. Key recommendations state that transthoracic echocardiography is reasonable to monitor disease progression and/or response to therapy, and that transthoracic echocardiography for left atrial size/function and transesophageal echocardiography for the left atrial appendage are useful to guide initiation and management of anticoagulation in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. They also note that CMR assessment of LV wall thickness, LV mass, and particularly extracellular volume (ECV) is emerging as a tool to assess disease progression and response to therapy, whereas serial SPECT 99mTc–PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy is currently not recommended to assess disease progression or response to therapy.

Case 1: Mr. C — The Homozygous Male

Mr. C is a 62-year-old Black American male referred for evaluation of heart failure. The patient reported shortness of breath with climbing 1 flight of stairs, lower extremity pitting edema, and orthopnea over the course of the prior year. During this period, the patient had multiple hospital admissions for recurring pleural effusion and cough. He had a history of hypertension and a neuropathic history of bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome at age 49 years and sciatica at age 56. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed increased left ventricular wall thickness with a septal wall diameter of 2.1 cm and severe diastolic dysfunction with a restrictive filling pattern. Using 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography, we observed relative apical sparing of longitudinal strain. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) demonstrated diffusely elevated native T1 values, and we noted an abnormal nulling pattern on post-contrast inversion time (TI) scout sequences. Post-contrast delayed imaging also exhibited diffuse subendocardial enhancement in a pattern consistent with amyloidosis. Serum and urine immunofixation and free light chain assays showed no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging revealed increased uptake in the myocardium with a heart to contralateral lung uptake (HCL) ratio of 1.8 and a visual cardiac uptake grade of 3. On serum laboratory analysis, his serum troponin I and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations were elevated. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous V122I mutation, establishing the diagnosis of hATTR cardiac amyloidosis. Mr. C initiated disease-modifying therapy with tafamidis; however, his heart failure continued to advance, and he underwent isolated heart transplantation 2 years later. Treatment with tafamidis was continued after transplantation.

### Correlation between cardiac images, biomarkers, and amyloid load in wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^117TmkTp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM) is a progressive and infiltrative disease characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac conduction system alterations caused by the deposition of insoluble transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space of the myocardium. Although wild‐type ATTR‐CM (ATTRwt‐CM) was previously considered a rare disease, recent diagnostic imaging modalities have revealed it to be considerably underdiagnosed among elderly patients with heart failure. In addition, ATTRwt‐CM has received considerable attention because of the development of novel disease‐modifying treatments like tafamidis and patisiran.

A systematic evaluation suggested that several imaging modalities and biomarkers are useful for the diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ATTR‐CM. 99m Tc‐labeled pyrophosphate (99m Tc‐PYP) scintigraphy, or native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) measurements in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), are remarkably sensitive and specific for ATTR‐CM diagnosis. Moreover, marked 99m Tc‐PYP positivity and an elevated native T1 and ECV have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis in this condition. Other parameters such as an impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS) on echocardiographyand elevated levels of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) and NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide), are also associated with poor prognosis in patients with ATTRwt‐CM. These reports suggest that 99m Tc‐PYP positivity as well as native T1, ECV, GLS, and cardiac biomarkers are related to disease progression in ATTR‐CM.

Regarding histological findings, it has been reported that an extensive cardiac amyloid load is predictive of poor clinical outcomes and resistance to chemotherapy in light‐chain amyloidosis. We hypothesized that cardiovascular imaging findings, cardiac biomarkers, and pathological findings would reflect the progression of cardiac amyloidosis and that the cardiac amyloid load would have a close relationship with these parameters. If our hypothesis was true, these correlations might allow for noninvasive estimation of amyloid deposits, which to date can only be assessed by invasive means.

Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the associations among images obtained using several disease‐specific modalities (99m Tc‐PYP scintigraphy, CMR, and echocardiography), cardiac biomarker levels (hs‐cTnT and BNP [B‐type natriuretic peptide]), and the histological cardiac amyloid load in patients with ATTRwt‐CM.

Clinical scenarios #3 and #4 — evaluation of biopsy-proven AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis — state that although biopsy-proven AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is a definitive diagnosis, imaging was still considered to assess amyloid burden, response to therapy, or transplant eligibility; for these indications, 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy is not performed clinically and was rated "Rarely Appropriate", whereas echocardiography and CMR were rated "Appropriate" for quantifying cardiac amyloid burden.

Results

Patient population

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of all 23 patients (mean age, 78.0 ± 10.1 years; male, 18 [78%]). All patients were assessed by SPECT/CT 1 hour after 99m Tc-PYP injection. Thirteen of them were also assessed by SPECT/CT at 3 hours because we changed the imaging protocol in November 2021, and they included patients who had been diagnosed with hereditary ATTR-CM and treated with tafamidis (Table 1). All 23 patients were proven positive for ATTR amyloid from biopsy specimens. None of the image data have been previously published.

Radionuclide imaging acquisition and initial interpretation using 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP — images should be acquired early (1 hour) or late (2–3 hours), the first step of interpretation is to visually confirm diffuse myocardial radiotracer uptake and differentiate this uptake from residual blood pool activity or overlapping bone using SPECT and planar images, if myocardial uptake is confirmed visually there are two approaches to differentiate AL from ATTR cardiac amyloidosis depending on the tracer used and time between injection and scan acquisition, and SPECT imaging is necessary for studies that show planar myocardial uptake because they can help differentiate myocardial uptake from blood pool or overlying bone uptake.

Future directions in cardiac amyloidosis imaging — early detection with imaging remains an unmet need and techniques that identify disease at an earlier stage are needed; 99mTc PYP/DPD/HMDP have the potential for early detection of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis prior to echocardiography and CMR, which needs further validation. Molecular imaging techniques, including amyloid binding PET radionuclide tracers and ECV by CMR, are particularly well suited to detect early disease, and further studies are needed. Early detection of cardiac amyloidosis could allow targeted therapy prior to symptom onset and improve clinical outcomes, which needs to be studied further.

Technetium-labeled bone-avid scintigraphy for ATTR-CM — Technetium-based compounds (pyrophosphate [Tc-PYP], diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid [Tc-DPD], and hydroxymethylene diphosphonate [Tc-HMDP]), originally used in bone imaging, have emerged as an important imaging tool in the diagnosis of ATTR-CM. Cardiac scintigraphy with Tc-PYP requires intravenous injection of the radiopharmaceutical followed by the acquisition of planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or SPECT/computed tomography images at 1 or 3 hours after injection; because radiotracers can persist in the ventricular cavity and be mistaken for myocardial uptake on planar imaging, a diagnostic pitfall would be to perform planar imaging alone, and subsequent SPECT images must be acquired if uptake is present to distinguish myocardial uptake from the blood pool radiotracer signal. Technetium 99m-methyl diphosphonate is not an acceptable tracer for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM. The 2022 shortage of Tc-PYP because of supply-chain disruptions engendered significant inequities of care; comparative dose performance studies of Tc-PYP and Tc-HMDP will be important to validate interchangeability and permit continued new ATTR-CM diagnoses to be made noninvasively. A qualitative and quantitative scoring system has been developed to make the diagnosis of ATTR-CM based on the uptake of these radiotracers.

### How to perform and interpret cardiac amyloidosis radionuclide imaging (CARI) [^114Vkdmv]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis radionuclide imaging (CARI) has transformed the diagnostic approach to suspected transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), enabling non-invasive diagnosis and reducing the need for biopsy. This review provides practical guidance for performing and interpreting CARI, illustrated by a clinical case. Exclusion of monoclonal gammopathy is essential to preserve specificity. When absent, Perugini grade 2–3 uptake on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is diagnostic; planar imaging or heart-to-contralateral ratios alone are insufficient. Optimal practice includes validated tracers (99mTc-DPD, -PYP, -HMDP), correct timing to avoid blood pool activity, and SPECT - preferably with CT - for accurate localization. Interpretation should account for pitfalls such as non-diffuse uptake, artifacts, and alternative causes (e.g. AL amyloidosis, infarction, drug toxicity). Emerging applications include quantitative SPECT/CT for staging, prognosis, and therapy monitoring, though standardization is needed. Adherence to expert consensus and technical standards maximizes diagnostic accuracy and safe integration of CARI into the management of cardiac amyloidosis.

### Correlation between cardiac images, biomarkers, and amyloid load in wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^117WZDUH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, we confirmed the assumption of correlation. In this regard, Martinez‐Naharro et alhad reported that, in patients with ATTR‐CM, native T1 and ECV had good correlation with each other (r = 0.726) and were associated with the grade of cardiac uptake in bone scintigraphy. However, no analyses regarding quantitative 99m Tc‐PYP positivity and CMR findings were conducted in their study. Considering the results of our study, native T1, ECV, and H/CL ratio may similarly reflect the pathological status and progression of ATTR‐CM.

The mean cardiac amyloid load in this study was 22.9%. Analyzing 74 patients with ATTRwt‐CM, Kristen et alreported a comparatively higher mean cardiac amyloid load (34.0%). However, subjects in their study had a thicker septal wall (median, 20 mm) and lower LVEF (median, 42.7%) than our subjects, which is characteristic of more advanced disease. We classified the high and low amyloid load groups by median value (21.2%). The high amyloid load group was younger than the low amyloid load group (72.7 ± 5.5 years versus 76.3 ± 5.7 years). This result was inconsistent that ATTRwt‐CM is a progressive disease associated with aging. We had to confirm the histological diagnosis to use tafamidis in Japan. Therefore, myocardial biopsy was performed in younger patients considering tafamidis administration and might be avoided in elderly advanced patients. This selection bias may cause this discrepancy.

Key recommendations for standardized image techniques — radionuclide imaging state that 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP and 123I-mIBG imaging should be performed using standard protocols as discussed in this section. SPECT imaging is useful particularly in positive or equivocal cases to differentiate myocardial from blood pool signal and to describe regional heterogeneity.

An electronic, web-based survey addressing specifics on Tc-99m PYP imaging was emailed to ASNC members, totaling 2785 recipients. Only one response per institution was allowed.

Results

Responses were collected from 101 centers between July 2 and July 27, 2015. Among the respondents, 24% performed Tc-99m PYP specifically for CA diagnosis. The most commonly used dose was 20 mCi (37%) and most centers (35%) imaged 1 hour after injection. Scans were most often interpreted by cardiologists (60%). Quantification of uptake was performed in 57% of institutions with almost half (43%) utilizing the heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio.

Conclusions

This national survey shows relatively low penetrance and high variability in Tc99m-PYP scintigraphy for CA diagnosis highlighting the need for standardization.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

The study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Kumamoto University (Approval No. 1385). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the low‐risk nature of this retrospective study and the inability to obtain consent directly from all subjects. Instead, we extensively announced this study protocol at Kumamoto University Hospital and on our website and provided patients with the opportunity to withdraw from it.

Study Population

A total of 88 consecutive patients with ATTRwt‐CM, who simultaneously underwent both 99m Tc‐PYP scintigraphy and CMR for evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis between March 2017 and October 2021 at Kumamoto University Hospital, were evaluated. Data were retrieved from electronic medical records. All study patients underwent echocardiography and laboratory testing in a clinically stable, noncongested condition at diagnosis.

Diagnosis of ATTR‐CM and Genetic Testing

The diagnosis of amyloid deposition was based on the observation of apple‐green birefringence in biopsies stained with Congo red using cross‐polarized light microscopy. To confirm the nature of the amyloid, we performed immunohistochemical staining using antibodies that reacted with transthyretin. ATTR‐CM was diagnosed in the following cases: (1) presence of transthyretin deposition in the myocardium, (2) presence of transthyretin deposition in extracardiac tissue with positive findings on the 99m Tc‐PYP scintigraph, or (3) positive findings on the 99m Tc‐PYP scintigraph without confirmation of pathological transthyretin deposition but with the exclusion of light‐chain amyloidosis by serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. ATTRwt was diagnosed based on the absence of mutations in the TTR gene (assessed by genetic testing) or, in elderly patients, the absence of a family history of amyloidosis if genetic testing was not performed.

According to the diagnostic criteria of cardiac amyloidosis in the Japanese Circulation Society guideline, the confirmation of histologically amyloid deposition in cardiac or extracardiac tissue is necessary to definitively diagnose ATTR‐CM. In addition to the necessity of pathological diagnosis in patients with hematological abnormalities, we had to confirm the histological diagnosis to use tafamidis in Japan. Therefore, we performed an extracardiac biopsy, even though noninvasive diagnostic criteria were applied.

Future directions — imaging research priorities in cardiac amyloidosis emphasize earlier detection and quantitative assessment. The field of imaging in cardiac amyloidosis is expanding rapidly and more research is needed in several key areas. Early detection with imaging remains an unmet need in cardiac amyloidosis, and techniques that identify disease at an earlier stage are needed, and 99mTc PYP/ DPD/ HMDP have the potential for early detection of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis prior to echocardiography and CMR, which needs further validation. Molecular imaging techniques, including amyloid binding PET radioligand tracers and ECV by CMR, are noted as particularly well suited to detect early disease; early detection could allow targeted therapy prior to symptom onset and improve clinical outcomes. Methods for quantitative assessment of systemic and cardiac burden are needed, with ECV assessment by CMR and 18F-labelled PET tracers having potential to provide accurate quantification but requiring additional evaluation and more widespread dissemination. Additional priorities include precise detection of changes in burden to evaluate emerging novel therapies, investigation of advanced echocardiography including 3D echocardiographic strain, dynamic echocardiography, left atrial mechanics, and automated, machine learning-based methods, and prospective studies evaluating the incremental diagnostic and prognostic value of non-invasive imaging.

Cardiac amyloidosis — tissue biopsy role and endomyocardial biopsy indications are as follows: Histologic confirmation of amyloid deposits via tissue biopsy established diagnosis before cardiac scintigraphy, and obtaining tissue allows immunohistologic determination or proteomic analysis of the amyloidogenic precursor protein by mass spectrometry; endomyocardial biopsy should be performed (if other tissue biopsy does not confirm amyloid) in patients with high clinical suspicion with a monoclonal protein by immunofixation electrophoresis and/or an abnormal sFLC K/L ratio above the upper range of normal, in those with high clinical suspicion despite negative or equivocal Tc-PYP imaging, or when cardiac scintigraphy is unavailable.

### ATTR cardiomyopathy meets multiple Myeloma: the importance of cardiac biopsy [^112G264w]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

This case has 3 key learning points. First, endomyocardial biopsy is essential in diagnosing CA with concomitant MM. Often times, biopsy is deferred for less invasive testing, but in the setting of either abnormal serum free light chains or in the presence of an M-spike on serum/urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, PYP scan is contraindicated due to the reduced specificity and possibility of false positives. The utility of cardiac biopsy also outweighs fat pad biopsy, which has limited sensitivity and does not help differentiate the type of CA, because ATTR-CM can still be present in the setting of a monoclonal gammopathy. Second, the implications of accurate subtyping of AL-CA versus ATTR-CM in management and prognosis are profound. Avoiding anchoring bias led to a cardiac biopsy and secured an accurate diagnosis of ATTR-CM as the etiology of his HF. This led to disease-specific treatment with tafamidis, which we expect to slow the progression of his ATTR-CM. Third, genetic sequencing to characterize wild-type versus variant ATTR is also of significance because it informs the proband's family members regarding the possible need for genetic testing. This case highlights the importance of cardiac biopsy to accurately diagnose CA in a patient with MM and HF symptoms.

Cardiac amyloidosis 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy addendum — acquisition, interpretation, and reporting are updated: 2- or 3-hour imaging is recommended, and 1-hour imaging is optional, with 3-hour imaging recommended if excess blood pool activity is noted; SPECT imaging is required in all studies and 1-hour planar-only imaging is not recommended. For interpretation, planar imaging and heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio alone are insufficient for diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis and SPECT imaging is necessary to identify myocardial uptake, and repeat imaging is recommended at 3 hours if excess blood pool activity is noted. For reporting, diffuse myocardial uptake should be visualized to report a positive scan, and the criterion for H/CL ratio > 1.5 as strongly positive has been removed. Emerging literature suggests that cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) SPECT can also be used for 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP imaging.

Echocardiography — interpretation categories and follow-up actions classify findings as: Not suggestive with normal LV wall thickness, normal LV mass, normal atrial size, and septal or lateral tissue Doppler e′ velocity > 10 cm/s; Strongly suggestive with increased LV wall thickness and mass, a typical LV longitudinal strain pattern, and features such as mitral annular TDI e′ ≤ 5 cm/s with biatrial enlargement and small effusions; and Equivocal when findings are not described above. Clinicians are advised to interpret results in the context of prior evaluation and to provide follow-up, noting that strongly suggestive echocardiography cannot distinguish AL from TTR cardiac amyloidosis, that endomyocardial biopsy is not always indicated in such patients, and to consider evaluation to exclude AL amyloidosis and imaging with 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP to exclude ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

Interpretation of 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP imaging for cardiac amyloidosis uses visual grade categories and explicit recommended statements. An overall interpretation into categories of not suggestive, strongly suggestive, or equivocal for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis after exclusion of a systemic plasma cell dyscrasia is required. Not suggestive corresponds to a semi-quantitative visual Grade of 0. Equivocal applies if diffuse myocardial uptake is visually confirmed and the semi-quantitative visual grade is 1 or there is interpretive uncertainty of grade 1 versus grade 2. Strongly suggestive applies if diffuse myocardial uptake is visually confirmed with a semi-quantitative visual grade of 2 or 3. A statement that evaluation for AL amyloidosis by serum FLCs, serum, and urine immunofixation is recommended in all patients undergoing 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scans for cardiac amyloidosis. Results should be interpreted in the context of prior evaluation, and referral to a hematologist or amyloidosis expert is recommended if either recommended echo/CMR is strongly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis and 99mTc- PYP/DPD/HMDP is not suggestive or equivocal and/or FLCs are abnormal or equivocal.

Methods to Address Diagnostic Challenges in the Field

While echocardiography, CMR, and Tc‐PyP/DPD have an established role in imaging CA, there remain gaps in our understanding of how best to apply these modalities. For example,

while the diagnostic efficacies of echocardiography, CMR, and Tc‐PyP/DPD have been well studied in patients with suspected CA, few studies have directly compared them. Further multimodality studies are needed to determine the cardiac imaging modality of choice for screening patients with suspected CA and asymptomatic ATTRv carriers. Additionally, further studies are needed to better understand the role of novel cardiac imaging techniques such as 18 F‐Florbetafir PET, and hybrid PET/CMR. 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 Studies are also currently under way to assess whether serum misfolded ATTR oligomer levels can be used to noninvasively screen for cardiac involvement in ATTR. 70 Whether these contemporary techniques have a role in clinical practice or are better suited to the research setting is currently unknown.

Moreover, further research is needed to determine the ideal cardiac imaging and blood‐based biomarkers for assessing response to therapy in CA both in clinical practice as well as clinical trials. While ongoing clinical trials dedicated to this question are limited, cardiac imaging markers are now increasingly being utilized as end points in large pharmaceutical trials. 26 The increased inclusion of echocardiography, CMR, and PET parameters in amyloid clinical trials will help us to better understand the additive role of cardiac imaging in monitoring treatment response in CA.

Bone-avid radiotracers for cardiac scintigraphy (99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP) are described as "remarkably sensitive (but not completely specific) for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis", with multicenter data in 1498 patients showing a positive predictive value of 100% (95% confidence interval, 98.0–100) when echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance is consistent/suggestive and monoclonal protein studies are absent; diagnostic parameters include visual grade, heart-to-contralateral (H/CL) ratio and heart-to-whole-body (H/WB) retention assessed at both 1 and 3 hours, with visual grade 2 on 99mTc-DPD being 100% sensitive and 100% specific for ATTR versus AL and controls, a H/CL ratio ≥ 1.5 on 1-hour images (with visual Grade 2–4) achieving area under the curve 0.992 (P < 0.0001), and a H/CL ratio ≥ 1.3 proposed on late (3-hour) 99mTc-PYP images; in TTR mutation cohorts, left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.2 cm is associated with higher H/WB retention, though the yield of 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy in earlier or pre-clinical disease is yet to be confirmed.

### Design and rationale the SCAN-MP (screening for cardiac amyloidosis with nuclear imaging in minority populations) study [^113WHmFM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis is essential to best capitalize on the efficacy of emerging therapies that predominantly address new amyloid fibril formation but do not address existing deposits. Identification of affected individuals is also essential to avoid institution of heart failure therapies that have potential harm, particularly in the management of atrial dysrhythmias. As an example, case reports suggest that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are poorly tolerated in patients with cardiac amyloidosis and, by expert consensus opinion, are avoided. Additionally, emerging data suggest that standard heart failure therapy, especially β‐blockers, may need to be avoided, de‐prescribed, or at least not given in high dosages in ATTR‐CM.

The natural history of TTR cardiac amyloidosis was quite poor just a decade ago, with studies showing declines in 6‐minute hall walk distance of ≈25 m along with increases in NT‐proBNP of > 1800 picograms/mL every 6 months and very high mortality in 2 to 3 years. However, there has been tremendous progress in the ability to identify patients at an earlier stage of disease, at a time when pharmacological therapies have the potential to have the greatest benefit. This is in part driven by the capacity of scintigraphy to establish a diagnosis of ATTR‐CM without a biopsy and accordingly, those identified with ATTR‐CM by scintigraphy appear to be diagnosed at a much earlier state of disease. Ironically, even though the most common cardiovascular question prompting Tc‐99m‐PYP scintigraphy is for diagnosis of ATTR‐CM, the radiopharmaceutical is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. SCAN‐MP is operating under an Investigational New Drug application from the US Food and Drug Administration and will provide essential data on the interobserver reproducibility of Tc‐99m‐PYP and it its diagnostic utility that could be used to expand its labeled indication.

MOLECULAR IMAGING OF AMYLOIDOSIS–SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY: ATTR AMYLOIDOSIS

BACKGROUND.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99m Tc-pyrophosphate (99m Tc-PYP), 99m Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99m Tc-DPD), or 99m Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99m Tc-HMDP) bone-avid radiotracers has emerged as a highly specific means to diagnose ATTR-CM, in the setting of imaging suspicious for cardiac amyloidosis and a negative work-up for a plasma cell disorder. This technique has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice, minimizing need for invasive endomyocardial biopsy for a diagnosis of ATTR-CM. In treatment trials, a decrease in cardiac radiotracer uptake (99m Tc-PYP/DPD/HMDP) has been reported with both TTR-stabilizing – and -silencing therapies, (Figure 5). One study showed that the cohorts of patients with a decrease in 99m Tc-DPD retention index (> median vs < median decrease) had improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); whether this portends better long-term cardiac structural and functional improvements and clinical outcomes is not yet known. Absolute quantitation of myocardial uptake of 99m Tc-PYP/DPD/HMDP using SPECT/computed tomography (CT) technology is an advancement that has potential to identify early cardiac amyloidosis, predict prognosis, and detect changes in response to therapy.

Cardiac amyloidosis radionuclide scintigraphy with technetium bisphosphonates — tracers, disease-type avidity, and access is summarized as follows: "Radionuclide imaging provides critical information on amyloid type that complements cardiac structural and functional characterization by echocardiography and CMR". There is "a unique myocardial uptake pattern in amyloid by scintigraphy with 99mTechnetium (Tc)-bisphosphonate derivatives 99mTc-pyrophosphate [PYP], 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD), 99mTc hydroxymethylene- diphosphonate [99mTc-HMDP]". Studies "discovered that ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has avidity for bone radiotracers, whereas AL cardiac amyloidosis has minimal or no avidity for these tracers". Although "there is no direct comparison between these tracers, the information available suggests they can be used interchangeably", and "there is limited access to 99mTc-DPD and 99mTc-HMDP in the United States and 99mTc-PYP in Europe".

Reporting — echocardiography in cardiac amyloidosis classifies overall interpretation into three categories with defining features and follow-up steps. Not suggestive includes normal structure with septal or lateral tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) e′ velocity > 10 cm/s. Strongly suggestive includes increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness/mass, typical LV longitudinal strain pattern, and mitral annular TDI s′ < 5 cm/sec with additional supportive findings; Equivocal denotes findings not otherwise described. Interpret the echo results in the context of prior evaluation. Follow-up guidance notes that strongly suggestive echocardiographic findings cannot distinguish AL from TTR cardiac amyloidosis and that endomyocardial biopsy is not always indicated in such patients; consider evaluation to exclude AL (serum and urine immunofixation, serum free light chain assay) and to exclude ATTR with imaging using 99mTc–PYP/DPD/HMDP.

### DPD quantification in cardiac Amyloidosis: a novel imaging biomarker [^116TEDt6]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

PYP scintigraphy is an alternative radiotracer used in the United States for the detection of ATTR-CA, with imaging currently recommended at 1-h post-injection with both SPECT and planar acquisitions and optional 3-h SPECT or planar imaging. It is generally reported using both a visual grading system and a semi-quantitative heart to contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio from the planar images, with ratios ≥ 1.5 at 1 h classified as ATTR-positive. Furthermore, a H/CL ratio ≥ 1.6 in patients with ATTR-CA seems to predict a worse outcome.

By comparison, SPECT allows the three-dimensional visualization of radioactivity within the body, which can be used to display a standardized uptake value (SUV), a semi-quantitative representation of the concentration of radiopharmaceutical in the respective tissues. SPECT quantification has been used in dementia imaging and tumor dosimetry in radioimmunotherapy.

Cardiac amyloid deposition increases myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) greater than any other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, due to the extracellular deposition of the amyloid fibrils. These increases are detectable using computed tomography imaging, which has been validated against both cardiovascular magnetic resonance and invasive biopsy.

The goal of the current study was to investigate whether SPECT/computed tomography (CT)–derived SUV quantification would improve DPD diagnostic accuracy and offer a means of quantifying amyloid burden.

### Monitoring tafamidis, the most expensive cardiac medication: are serum transthyretin levels the answer? [^116VmaVP]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Beyond the scope of this observational study, a clinical question is whether we need to test TTR levels for therapeutic monitoring at all or more than once. From the available data, the stabilizing effect of tafamidis appears almost universal. Barring a low TTR level from a secondary cause, the data suggest that TTR levels would increase in almost all patients. ATTR-CM is a life-threatening condition with a poor prognosis if untreated; coupled with the astronomical cost of therapy, patients, providers, and insurers are understandably eager to assess response to therapy. However, treatment response in ATTR-CM is challenging for multiple reasons. Given that tafamidis slows the progression of disease, how does one determine whether an individual patient's trajectory represents an adequate response to therapy? Natural history studies, biomarker staging systems, and clinical experience provide perspective but not objective data to determine efficacy in an individual patient. Even therapies that may reverse disease will likely be hampered by the very slowly progressive nature of ATTR-CM. Because this disease likely develops over decades, it may take years to detect clinically significant changes in cardiac imaging parameters. Patients and providers, especially those less familiar with ATTR-CM, will benefit from the virtue of watchful waiting and avoidance of tests that will not change management. In the future, as treatment options are likely to expand beyond TTR stabilizers, perhaps TTR levels will be used to guide therapy. For now, in the absence of proven testing for tafamidis efficacy, close monitoring for heart failure symptoms, disease progression, and eligibility for organ transplantation remain the mainstays of clinical follow-up.

In summary, Falk et al report the observation that serum TTR levels increased with tafamidis use and speculate that TTR levels may provide insight into TTR stability and drug efficacy. There is an ongoing need for more data from both clinical trials and postapproval use to help inform clinical decision making as it pertains to the use of serum TTR levels in monitoring the treatment of patients with ATTR-CM.

ASNC/AHA/ASE/EANM/HFSA/ISA/SCMR/SNMMI cardiac amyloidosis imaging addendum — For 99mTc-PYP acquisition, the time between injection and scan is revised: 2- or 3-hour imaging is recommended, and 1-hour imaging is optional; if excess blood pool activity is noted, 3-hour imaging is recommended.

For interpretation, planar imaging and heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) ratio alone are insufficient for diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, and SPECT imaging is necessary to identify myocardial uptake of 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP; repeat imaging is recommended at 3 hours if excess blood pool activity is noted, and visual grading on planar and SPECT imaging is the primary method for diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. For reporting, diffuse myocardial uptake should be visualized to report a positive scan, and the criterion for H/CL ratio > 1.5 as strongly positive has been removed.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients presenting with a characteristic amyloid CMR and either no uptake or mild cardiac uptake are subsequently diagnosed with AL-CA. Therefore, following the exclusion of rare TTR variants and rare forms of CA through comprehensive genotyping, the combination of a CMR that is characteristic for CA and grade 0 or 1 cardiac uptake on scintigraphy confers a 100% specificity for AL-CA and can be used to refine the diagnostic differentials while awaiting histologic confirmation.

Since the publication of the nonbiopsy pathway, use of bone scintigraphy to diagnose ATTR-CA has risen significantly, with multiple different technetium-based radiotracers being used. The diagnostic performance of these agents is assumed to be broadly similar; however, this hypothesis is yet to be tested in a head-to-head trial. It is possible that optimal image acquisition time and image interpretation techniques may vary between tracers. In the United States, 99m Tc-PYP is most commonly used and scans are predominantly interpreted by nuclear cardiologists; whereas in Europe, 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP are most commonly used and scans are predominantly interpreted by nuclear medicine physicians. Aside from the conventional visual score, quantitative scores derived from planar imaging have been used in the past. The heart-to-whole-body ratio is used for 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP, whereas the heart-to-contralateral ratio is used for 99m Tc-PYP; therefore, thoracic imaging may be acquired when using 99m Tc-PYP, whereas whole body imaging is acquired when using 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP. However, these planar imaging–derived metrics are no longer recommended by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology for the diagnosis of ATTR-CA in isolation, and visual grading by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is mandated (SPECT–computed tomography [CT] if available may be preferred). SPECT images are able to differentiate blood pool activity (false positive on planar) from true LV myocardial uptake (true positive) (Figure 5). When the recommended imaging methodology is used, there is excellent interobserver reproducibility and intraobserver repeatability of 99m Tc-PYP visual scan interpretation. It is also hypothesized that the magnitude of myocardial radiotracer uptake, as quantified by these various methods, could reflect the CA burden. However, because of competitive tracer uptake, the dynamics and kinetics of radiotracer uptake are significantly influenced by uptake in the bones, soft tissues, skeletal muscle, and the heart. The presence of extracardiac amyloid would influence the percentage cardiac uptake; therefore, this may not be an accurate representation of the CA burden. In the era before availability of TTR-specific therapy, 99m Tc-PYP planar visual grade did not change after ~1.5 years despite clinical evidence of disease progression. In contrast, with use of TTR-directed therapies, emerging data show significant reduction in myocardial uptake of bone-avid tracers despite absence of significant changes in cardiac structure and cardiac function. This discordance with structural and functional imaging suggests that a decrease in bone-avid tracer myocardial uptake may represent a molecular change in amyloid fibril rather than a reduction in amyloid mass.

### Effect of tafamidis on clinical and functional parameters in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^116QNWBe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding imaging parameters, although only small cohort studies and case series are currently available for analysis, they are emerging as surrogate markers to reflect disease progression and monitor therapeutic responses. Changes in follow-up imaging results in patients with ATTR-CM after tafamidis treatment have attracted increasing attention; however, the modalities and protocols used among previous studies have varied and been inconsistent. This meta-analysis comprehensively investigated the effects of tafamidis on amyloid deposition, as well as cardiac structure and function. ECV was shown to be an independent predictive factor for mortality, and it was also shown to be correlated with amyloid content in patients with ATTR-CM. Two pioneering studies applying CMR demonstrated that tafamidis treatment could stabilize ECV progression in patients with wild-type ATTR. Our previous cohort study further validated that tafamidis treatment was associated with decreased ECV in patients with hereditary ATTR-CM. In addition, ECV has been well correlated with tracer uptake in technetium-99m scintigraphy, and the results of the present study showed a marked reduction in H/CL ratio after tafamidis treatment. Native T1 mapping directly measures intrinsic signals from the myocardium, encompassing both intracellular and extracellular spaces. Unlike T1 mapping, ECV specifically reflects alterations in the extracellular space. As a result, ECV measurements can accurately assess the extent of extracellular space infiltration, making it a more precise marker of infiltration and enabling its use as a tool for predicting outcomes and monitoring treatment response. In the current meta-analysis, we did not find differences after tafamidis treatment in native T1 mapping, which may be due to differences in field strengths, techniques of acquisition, and vendors among studies. Differences in left ventricular mass index, which is a less sensitive marker of amyloid infiltration, as quantified by CMR were also not significant.

Emerging Challenges and Dilemmas

CA is diagnosed and staged using a multimodality approach combining cardiac imaging, biomarkers, and occasionally invasive tissue biopsy. Echocardiography and CMR have an important role in screening patients suspected to have CA based on clinical features. ECV by CMR is highly reproducible and can track amyloidosis disease burden serially to assess therapeutic response. 10, 46, 47 Tc‐PyP/DPD and light chain analysis are important in screening for CA and in helping to determine amyloid subtype. Invasive tissue biopsy is required in immunoglobulin light chain; however, in ATTR, invasive biopsy is generally reserved when the initial testing is inconclusive. While this approach successfully guides therapy for most patients, there remain key gaps in our current understanding. These include growing awareness that indeterminate or discrepant findings can be seen with either cardiac imaging studies or blood biomarkers, and can complicate the diagnosis of CA. Additionally, the optimal method of screening asymptomatic ATTRv carriers and monitoring response to amyloid treatment is currently poorly understood.

### Effect of tafamidis on clinical and functional parameters in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111gvRwp]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) has recently gained recognition as a rare and fatal disease. Tafamidis, a first-in-class transthyretin stabilizer, has emerged as a promising agent for attenuating disease progression. Nevertheless, how tafamidis alters clinical and imaging parameters remains unclear.

Objectives

This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate how tafamidis remodels the myocardium and influences the disease trajectory of ATTR-CM.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for literature from inception to February 2024 which reported either the effects of tafamidis treatment or natural course of ATTR-CM. Outcomes of interests were all clinical and imaging parameters available from at least 2 independent studies.

Results

We identified 30 studies comprising 2,973 participants with ATTR-CM. Pooling all studies with outcomes of both tafamidis and placebo, tafamidis significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.56) and cardiovascular death (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02–0.30). Tafamidis also ameliorated the deterioration of 6-minute walk distance (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.04 vs. -0.29, P = 0.002) and serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level (SMD: -0.03 vs 0.41, P < 0.001). Regarding imaging parameters, better global longitudinal strain on echocardiography (SMD: 0.06 vs 0.50, P = 0.003), heart to contralateral ratio (SMD: -0.23 vs. -1.17, P = 0.037) on technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy, extracellular volume (P = 0.003), left (P < 0.001) and right (P = 0.001) ventricular ejection fraction, and right atrium area (P = 0.033) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were observed after tafamidis treatment.

Conclusions

Tafamidis improves clinical outcomes and limits the progression of cardiac remodeling in ATTR-CM.

Diagnostic criteria for cardiac amyloidosis — expert consensus notes that the current diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is not standardized and that cardiac amyloidosis is confirmed with a positive endomyocardial biopsy for amyloid fibrils; in the absence of endomyocardial biopsy-proven disease, cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed using a combination of extracardiac biopsy, 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy, myocardial uptake of targeted positron emission tomography amyloid tracers, and echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance findings, and in the absence of a clonal plasma cell process, 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy consistent with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis combined with consistent echo or CMR findings obviates the need for invasive endomyocardial or extracardiac biopsy; an international consensus document on AL amyloidosis defines cardiac involvement by either endomyocardial biopsy or by systemic biopsy demonstrating AL amyloid and elevated LV wall thickness on echocardiography without alternative cardiac cause.

Cardiac amyloidosis — management imaging evidence and limitations: Echocardiography remains the cornerstone of serial assessment of LV dysfunction in patients with heart failure, yet there is relatively little information in the echocardiographic cardiac amyloidosis literature regarding assessment of disease progression and response to therapy; studies have shown potential benefit to demonstrate changes in disease in response to treatment in AL cardiac amyloidosis, determine anticoagulation need for stroke prophylaxis, diagnose progressive cardiac involvement after liver transplantation in ATTRv amyloidosis, and assess LV ejection fraction for stem‑cell transplantation consideration. Due to a higher incidence of cardiac thrombi in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, some centers consider a transesophageal echocardiogram prior to cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias even on therapeutic anticoagulation, and emerging data suggest that echocardiographic LV global longitudinal strain may be a marker of disease progression and response to therapy. In contrast, T1 mapping with ECV measurement by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can track multiple parameters of structural change, and in a small retrospective study decreases in LV mass and ECV on CMR were more prevalent in AL cardiac amyloidosis patients with a complete or very good partial response to chemotherapy. Although 99mTc‑PYP/DPD/HMDP scintigraphy correlates with anatomic and functional variables, it has not been definitively proven to quantify changes in response to current therapies and repeat studies are not typically clinically useful, while positron emission tomography is inherently more sensitive and quantitative and holds the possibility of monitoring therapy response with PET amyloid‑binding tracers once adequately studied. Experience with implantable cardioverter defibrillators is limited, and notably none of the imaging techniques have been validated for assessing response to therapy or correlated post‑therapy imaging changes with survival.

### Accuracy of Tc 99m PYP cardiac imaging for detecting ATTR cardiac amyloidosis… [^113BVYF6]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Among patients with highly suspected amyloid deposition, Tc 99m PYP cardiac imaging may be of diagnostic and prognostic importance. Importance Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In single-center studies, technetium 99m pyrophosphate cardiac imaging noninvasively detects ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, but the accuracy of this technique in a multicenter study and the association of Tc 99m PYP myocardial uptake with survival are unknown. Planar cardiac imaging of the chest was performed using 2-headed gamma cameras with low-energy, high-resolution collimators. First, 10 to 25 mCi of Tc 99m PYP was administered intravenously and incubated for either 1 hour, based on prior published amyloid imaging data, 11 or 3 hours, based on original ischemia literature.

15, 16 Following incubation, anterior and lateral planar views of the heart were obtained simultaneously for a total 750 000 counts. Based on prior published data using a 1-hour incubation, we defined a visual score of 2 or higher, or an H/CL ratio of 1. 5 or greater, to indicate ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. 11 For the scans that used a 3-hour incubation, the H/CL ratio threshold was lowered to 1. 3 or greater, corresponding to the best calculated area under the curve adjusting for higher bone activity seen with longer exposures. The recognition of cardiac amyloidosis before overt HFpEF symptoms ensue may be a key therapeutic goal given that the majority of the emerging agents are designed to prevent further amyloid deposition with no direct effect on deposited amyloid.

In the present study, the H/CL ratio was associated with the detection of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis across all NYHA classes, nearly half of which had NYHA class I or class II symptoms, which suggests that Tc 99m PYP may be used for patients with heart failure who are only mildly symptomatic. Therefore, our findings have direct clinical implications for the noninvasive detection of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, the enhancement of patient safety, and the prognostication of disease severity at the time of diagnosis.

### Effect of tafamidis on cardiac function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy… [^111SuJqh]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Patients were randomized to tafamidis meglumine, 80 mg or 20 mg, or placebo for 30 months. Main Outcomes and Measures. In ATTR-CM, the buildup of amyloid deposits in the myocardium leads to increased ventricular wall thickness and diastolic dysfunction. 2 ATTR-CM has been observed in relatively high proportions of older patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. and increased left ventricular wall thickness and may be a frequently overlooked cause of HFpEF. 4, 5 However, LV ejection fraction tends to decrease in advanced stages of the disease. 6, 7 Echocardiographic measures of both systolic and diastolic function, including. Tafamidis is a TTR kinetic stabilizer that inhibits tetramer dissociation, the rate-limiting step in TTR amyloidogenesis.

10 In the randomized Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial, tafamidis was shown to significantly reduce mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and to reduce decline in functional capacity and quality of life compared with placebo. 11 Despite a recognized clinical benefit of tafamidis, its effect on cardiac function as measured by echocardiographic parameters has not been fully characterized. LV radial strain is a measure of the thickening deformation of the LV between end-diastole and end-systole in the PSAX view. Basal, mid, and apical radial strain were calculated as the mean peak value of 2-D speckle tracking–derived strain of the LV basal, mid, and apical segments, respectively. Regional strain values were extracted from the TOMTEC software in the A4C view and PSAX view to allow comparisons between tafamidis and placebo.

Worsening of each echocardiographic measure was observed after 30 months, with greater decline in patients receiving placebo than in those receiving tafamidis, 80 mg. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics were markedly different among patients enrolled in APOLLO vs ATTR-ACT, 24 and patients with ATTR-CM have much more advanced disease compared with patients with transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy.

### Redefining cardiac involvement in systemic immunoglobulin AL amyloidosis… [^113HJrpZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This cohort study involved 560 patients newly diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis undergoing CMR with ECV mapping before chemotherapy. Of the different approaches used to define cardiac involvement, ECV mapping was the only independent predictor of prognosis and provided information on the relation between the depth and rapidity of hematological response and outcomes, with a rapid and deep hematological response being important in patients with increasing ECV. Among patients fulfilling the criteria for cardiac involvement, CMR with ECV mapping confirmed cardiac amyloid infiltration in most cases but found 27 to 37 patients without cardiac involvement. Conversely, among patients not fulfilling the criteria, CMR with ECV mapping identified cardiac amyloid infiltration in 17 patients to 49 patients.

Conversely, when using the Mayo stage, better survival was associated only with patients achieving at least VGPR at 1 month in all Mayo stages. Second, when all approaches currently used to define cardiac involvement were assessed in multivariable models, ECV mapping was the only independent predictor of prognosis. Third, the degree of cardiac infiltration, as measured by ECV mapping, provided information on the effect of the depth and rapidity of hematological response required; the key finding was that not all patients required a rapid hematological response, but a rapid and deep hematological response was crucial in patients with increasing degrees of cardiac infiltration, as redefined by CMR with ECV mapping. Native myocardial T1 is closely related to ECV, and changes in response to treatment have been recently associated with mortality.

25 Native myocardial T1 has the significant advantage of being measured with a single image acquisition without the need for contrast. The identification of accurate cutoff values of native myocardial T1 associated with increased ECV to redefine cardiac involvement among patients with systemic AL amyloidosis should be explored in future studies. This study found that CMR with ECV mapping has the key advantage of accurately characterizing the presence and extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration compared with both serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography. ECV mapping can independently predict overall survival in systemic AL amyloidosis and has the ability to help define hematological response associated with better long-term survival according to the presence and severity of cardiac amyloid infiltration.

### Tafamidis and the paradox of rare disease therapies… [^113LeSmE]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis is an underrecognized cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older adults, affecting approximately 120 000 US adults. 1 It is caused by the misfolding of transthyretin, which produces insoluble amyloid fibrils that deposit in interstitial space between cardiac myocytes. 2 Deposition of amyloid fibrils triggers cellular injury and reduces muscle compliance, eventually resulting in a restrictive cardiomyopathy. There are 2 types of ATTR-CM: wild-type, which is an aging-related process, and hereditary, which results from genetic variations that increase amyloid fibril formation. 2 Diagnosis of ATTR-CM is often delayed, as patients commonly see 5 or more physicians before receiving the correct diagnosis, and less than. half receive the correct diagnosis within 6 months of the onset of symptoms.

2 Although it is a rare disease, the rate of new diagnoses in the population has been increasing in recent years, fueled by growing awareness among clinicians, improved diagnostics, and the availability of effective therapies. 2 Some studies suggest that 10% to 15% of older adults with heart failure may have unrecognized ATTR-CM. In May 2019, tafamidis became the first drug approved for treating ATTR-CM. Tafamidis binds to the transthyretin tetramer and stabilizes it; this prevents the tetramer from dissociating into monomers that are required for amyloid formation. In the ATTR-ACT trial, 3 patients receiving tafamidis had a 13. 4% lower absolute mortality compared with patients receiving placebo. In the context of this newly available therapy, the increasing rate of diagnosis of ATTR-CM is a welcome development — early diagnosis and initiation of treatment may improve population health outcomes for this morbid condition.

But the hefty price tag of tafamidis and the large numbers of patients potentially eligible for therapy have been setting off alarm bells about large increases in pharmaceutical spending. The high total and out-of-pocket costs for tafamidis described by Blatt and colleagues4 have important implications for patients living with ATTR-CM and for the US health care system. Approximately 1 in 5 adults aged 65 years and older reported cost-related nonadherence, and nonadherence to cardiovascular drugs is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 7 Concerns about cost-related nonadherence are amplified among patients receiving tafamidis because of substantially higher out-of-pocket costs, which make.
