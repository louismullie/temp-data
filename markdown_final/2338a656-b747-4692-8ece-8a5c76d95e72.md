## Question

Atypical presentation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about atypical presentations, including definitions, mechanisms, exemplars, diagnostic pitfalls, and a practical approach to evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "atypical presentation" in a clinically useful, heterogeneous way. Then, I should verify the mechanisms that make presentations atypical. Next, I will review concrete exemplars across organ systems to anchor the concept. After that, I need to analyze diagnostic pitfalls and error patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight special populations and system-level implications, making sure I continuously self-check each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition problem, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing. The literature shows substantial heterogeneity in defining atypical presentations, with some authors emphasizing missing classic features, others emphasizing uncommon features, and still others emphasizing mimicry of other diseases; a recent scoping review proposed a PSUC framework (Primary, Suggestive, Uncommon, Chameleon) to classify patterns at high risk of diagnostic error, which I should keep in mind as I proceed.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I verify the main drivers. I will now examine the principal mechanisms: absence of textbook features, presence of uncommon but known features, mimicry of other diseases, and context modifiers such as age, comorbidity, and immune status; for example, immunocompromised hosts frequently have atypical pneumonia presentations, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease shows disproportionately atypical phenotypes, reinforcing how host and disease-context shape atypical expression [^115T7z2g] [^112G4WYv].

> Next, I should review concrete exemplars to ground the concept. Let me consider infectious diseases first: "atypical pneumonia" historically meant unusual clinical features, though the term is often misapplied to specific pathogens. Mpox frequently presents atypically, complicating clinical recognition. And COVID-19 has well-described extrapulmonary and atypical features that can mislead early diagnostic reasoning [^115GqbRu] [^114rQ9Ve] [^114L6TXi].

> I will now examine autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. SLE has protean, often atypical early features across organs, which can delay diagnosis. Giant cell arteritis can present with isolated atypical features such as vertigo or scalp necrosis, leading to treatment delays. And IgG4-related disease can mimic lymphoma or malignancy, demanding careful clinicopathologic correlation and biopsy [^1132D5Yw] [^112pkbBT] [^1114AmnM].

> Let me consider endocrine and metabolic conditions next. Atypical diabetes subtypes, including MODY and ketosis-prone forms, deviate from classic type 1/type 2 patterns and require targeted genetic or metabolic testing. Thyroid storm may present as an acute abdomen, obscuring the endocrine etiology. And Wilson disease can show atypical neuroimaging patterns that delay recognition [^112Px6mg] [^113Eu9ox] [^115BrZoF] [^111EEHqj].

> I should double-check neurologic and neurodegenerative examples. Atypical Alzheimer's phenotypes (logopenic PPA, posterior cortical atrophy, behavioral variant) are enriched in early-onset disease and carry high misdiagnosis rates without biomarkers; ALS mimics occur in up to 10% of initially diagnosed ALS; and stroke can present with atypical or nonlocalizing symptoms that derail timely reperfusion decisions [^112G4WYv] [^112p4jMf] [^11179R1g] [^112DorRx].

> But wait, what about pediatric and developmental contexts. Pediatric SLE often shows atypical onset and worse outcomes when atypical; Kawasaki disease has both incomplete and atypical variants that complicate timely diagnosis; and cystic fibrosis can present with atypical gastrointestinal features that are easy to miss outside CF centers [^112H5eZb] [^1127rPkw] [^113DMdZJ].

> Next, I should review diagnostic pitfalls and error patterns to ensure the approach addresses real-world vulnerabilities. Diagnostic error studies repeatedly identify failure to consider atypical presentations, failure to recognize severity or urgency, and testing-related failures (failure to order, misinterpretation, poor follow-up) as dominant themes; cognitive biases and anchoring are amplified when classic features are absent, and clinicians often over-attribute to common diseases when the presentation is atypical [^112CtJoV].

> Hold on, I should verify the consequences of these pitfalls. Atypical presentations are associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment, increased morbidity, and higher costs; for example, atypical GCA cases experience longer delays to steroids, and atypical AD carries markedly higher misdiagnosis rates than typical AD, delaying appropriate care and trial access [^112pkbBT] [^112p4jMf].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, but I need to ensure it is both systematic and adaptable. First, maintain diagnostic humility and actively counter anchoring by explicitly asking, "What if this is atypical for a common disease, or typical for a rare one?". Second, apply the PSUC framework to classify the presentation pattern and trigger expanded differentials. Third, use red flags and time course to escalate urgency, especially for rapidly progressive or multisystem disease. Fourth, tailor testing to pretest probabilities and atypical features, including early biomarkers or targeted genetics. Finally, build in explicit verification steps and follow-up to catch evolving clues [^111XnzX9].

> I should confirm special populations and system-level strategies. Immunocompromised patients warrant lower thresholds for invasive testing and broader infectious differentials given frequent atypical presentations; early-onset or rapidly progressive neurocognitive syndromes merit expedited specialist referral and biomarker testing; and structured decision pathways and team-based reviews can mitigate cognitive error and testing gaps in complex cases [^115T7z2g] [^1169WiGC] [^112CtJoV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that atypical simply means rare. I should correct that. Atypical can be an uncommon manifestation of a common disease or a typical manifestation of a rare disease, and the diagnostic risk is high in both scenarios; recognizing this duality helps avoid premature closure and supports a broader, time-aware differential when the story does not fit neatly [^111XnzX9].

---

An atypical presentation is a clinical presentation that **deviates from the classic or expected pattern** of a disease, often lacking hallmark features or showing unusual symptoms that mislead clinicians [^114Zu4q8]. These presentations are common in early disease, in children or older adults, in immunocompromised patients [^115T7z2g], or in those with comorbidities, and they **increase the risk of diagnostic delay or error** [^112CtJoV]. Recognizing atypical features requires a high index of suspicion, careful history and examination, and targeted testing; when the presentation is atypical, clinicians should broaden the differential, consider rare diseases, and use appropriate diagnostic tools to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment [^111XnzX9].

---

## Characteristics of atypical presentations

Atypical presentations **share several characteristics**:

- **Absence of hallmark features**: Classic signs or symptoms are missing or muted, making standard diagnostic criteria less reliable [^114Zu4q8].

- **Unusual symptom patterns**: Symptoms may be uncommon for the disease or appear in unexpected combinations [^1132D5Yw].

- **Mimicry of other conditions**: The presentation may resemble other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis [^11179R1g].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and immune status can significantly alter disease expression [^115T7z2g].

---

## Examples of atypical presentations

| **Condition** | **Typical presentation** | **Atypical presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Myocardial infarction | - Chest pain <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Diaphoresis | - Silent MI <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Syncope [^notfound] |
| Appendicitis | - Right lower quadrant pain <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting | - Left-sided pain <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Minimal abdominal tenderness [^notfound] |
| Tuberculosis | - Chronic cough <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Night sweats | - Rapid-onset nodules <br/> - Systemic symptoms without respiratory signs [^116coBDX] |
| Syphilis | - Primary chancre <br/> - Secondary rash | - Bone pain with lytic lesions in early disease [^112xRDG2] |
| Giant cell arteritis | - Headache <br/> - Jaw claudication <br/> - Visual symptoms | - Vertigo <br/> - Scalp necrosis <br/> - Dry cough [^112pkbBT] |

## Factors influencing atypical presentations

Several factors contribute to **atypical disease presentations**:

- **Age**: Pediatric and geriatric patients often present atypically due to immature or altered physiological responses [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Chronic conditions can mask or modify typical symptoms [^1124sHPt].

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients may have muted or altered inflammatory responses [^115T7z2g].

- **Genetic variability**: Individual genetic differences can influence disease expression and severity [^112Px6mg].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and strategies

Atypical presentations pose **significant diagnostic challenges**, including:

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Unusual symptoms may not trigger appropriate testing or referral [^1132D5Yw].

- **Misdiagnosis**: Conditions may be mistaken for more common diseases with similar features [^111RtnWE].

- **Increased healthcare utilization**: Repeated visits and unnecessary tests are common [^notfound].

To address these challenges, clinicians should:

- **Maintain a high index of suspicion**: Consider atypical presentations, especially in high-risk populations [^111Upic3].

- **Conduct thorough histories and examinations**: Detailed patient histories and careful physical examinations can uncover subtle clues [^112p4jMf].

- **Utilize appropriate diagnostic tools**: Targeted laboratory tests, imaging studies, and specialist consultations are essential [^111KxiXX].

- **Adopt flexible diagnostic criteria**: Recognize that rigid adherence to standard criteria may delay diagnosis in atypical cases [^116Ye2XF].

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

Atypical presentations can lead to **delayed treatment initiation**, worsening prognosis and increasing morbidity and mortality [^112H5eZb]. They also raise healthcare costs through additional testing, prolonged hospital stays, and specialist referrals. Patients may experience anxiety, frustration, and loss of trust in the healthcare system, underscoring the need for clear communication and patient education.

---

## Preventive measures and clinical guidelines

To minimize the impact of atypical presentations, healthcare systems should:

- **Educate healthcare professionals**: Regular training on recognizing atypical presentations and diagnostic pitfalls [^112CtJoV].

- **Develop clinical guidelines**: Flexible, evidence-based guidelines that accommodate atypical presentations [^115T7z2g].

- **Foster multidisciplinary collaboration**: Encourage teamwork among clinicians, specialists, and allied health professionals [^111KxiXX].

- **Engage patients**: Educate patients about atypical symptoms and encourage timely medical consultation [^111mSWtY].

---

Atypical presentations are deviations from classic disease patterns, often due to patient-specific factors. They require **heightened clinical awareness**, flexible diagnostic approaches, and coordinated care to prevent delays and improve outcomes.

ChatGPT's assessment of the commonality of the final diagnosis and typicality of presentation

ChatGPT assessed that the final diagnosis was common in 120/544 (22.1%) and the presentation was typical in 251/544 (46.1%) of the cases. Overall, ChatGPT classified six cases (1.1%) into the typical presentation of common disease, 114 (21.0%) into the atypical presentation of common disease, 245 (45.0%) into the typical presentation of uncommon disease and 179 (32.9%) into the atypical presentation of uncommon disease group. The inter-rater agreement of human and ChatGPT was 0.46 (0.36–0.56) for the commonality of the final diagnosis, 0.08 (0.00–0.16) for the typicality of presentation and 0.13 (0.07–0.20) for the classification by commonality and typicality.

### Comorbid neuropathology and atypical presentation of Alzheimer's disease [^1179TdF7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological changes present with amnestic and nonamnestic (atypical) syndromes. The contribution of comorbid neuropathology as a substratum of atypical expression of AD remains under investigated.

METHODS

We examined whether atypical AD exhibited increased comorbid neuropathology compared to typical AD and if such neuropathologies contributed to the accelerated clinical decline in atypical AD.

RESULTS

We examined 60 atypical and 101 typical AD clinicopathological cases. The number of comorbid pathologies was similar between the groups (p = 0.09). Argyrophilic grain disease was associated with atypical presentation (p = 0.008) after accounting for sex, age of onset, and disease duration. Vascular brain injury was more common in typical AD (p = 0.022). Atypical cases had a steeper Mini‐Mental Status Examination (MMSE) decline over time (p = 0.033).

DISCUSSION

Comorbid neuropathological changes are unlikely to contribute to atypical AD presentation and the steeper cognitive decline seen in this cohort.

Highlights

Autopsy cohort of 60 atypical and 101 typical AD; does comorbid pathology explain atypical presentation?
Atypical versus Typical AD: No significant differences in comorbid neuropathologies were found (p = 0.09).
Argyrophilic Grain Disease Association: significantly correlates with atypical AD presentations, suggesting a unique neuropathological pattern (p = 0.008).
Vascular Brain Injury Prevalence: Vascular brain injury is more common in typical AD than in atypical AD (p = 0.022).
Cognitive Decline in Atypical AD: Atypical AD patients experience a steeper cognitive decline measured by MMSE than those with typical AD despite lacking more comorbid neuropathology, highlighting the severity of atypical AD pathogenesis (p = 0.033).

### Atypical neuroimaging in Wilson's disease [^111EEHqj]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilson's disease is a rare metabolic disease involving copper metabolism. Neuroimaging plays an important part in evaluation of patients with a neuropsychiatric presentation. We present a case of a 14-year-old girl with atypical confluent white matter disease and cystic degeneration on MRI, with a rapidly progressive course, who succumbed to complications despite treatment with trientine. Wilson's disease should be considered as a differential for leucoencephalopathy in young patients with progressive neurological disease for its early recognition and optimum outcome.

### Atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis should exclude those with lifetime anorexia nervosa: commentary on walsh, hagan, and lockwood (2022) [^111fr4hu]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Atypical anorexia nervosa (AN) is not well-defined. Walsh, Hagan, and Lockwood (2022) review the data on atypical AN published in the last decade demonstrating overwhelming clinical similarities between atypical AN and AN. As written, atypical AN includes at least three clinical presentations that may not have the same underlying illness, and in turn, may have different prognoses and treatment needs: (1) higher-weight AN; (2) prodromal AN; and (3) partial remission from AN. While useful for the first two presentations, we suggest that the atypical AN diagnosis is not appropriate for those in partial remission from AN. Extant data document symptom fluctuation is part of illness course in AN rather than crossover to a distinct disorder. Further, lifetime AN carries the greatest risk for relapse to low-weight, premature death, and medical morbidities. Finally, emerging data support unique biobehavioral mechanisms in AN suggesting its combination with atypical AN is premature. Therefore, at this time, we recommend that the atypical AN diagnosis be reserved for those without lifetime AN. We encourage research to test and validate operational definitions of atypical AN and partial remission from AN, and further suggest documentation of lifetime AN across the eating disorders given its prognostic value.

### New insights into atypical Alzheimer's disease in the era of biomarkers [^112G4WYv]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Most patients with Alzheimer's disease present with amnestic problems; however, a substantial proportion, over-represented in young-onset cases, have atypical phenotypes including predominant visual, language, executive, behavioural, or motor dysfunction. In the past, these individuals often received a late diagnosis; however, availability of CSF and PET biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies and incorporation of atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease into new diagnostic criteria increasingly allows them to be more confidently diagnosed early in their illness. This early diagnosis in turn allows patients to be offered tailored information, appropriate care and support, and individualised treatment plans. These advances will provide improved access to clinical trials, which often exclude atypical phenotypes. Research into atypical Alzheimer's disease has revealed previously unrecognised neuropathological heterogeneity across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. Neuroimaging, genetic, biomarker, and basic science studies are providing key insights into the factors that might drive selective vulnerability of differing brain networks, with potential mechanistic implications for understanding typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

### Anthrax: a systematic review of atypical presentations [^115vTRzv]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

During the 2001 US anthrax attacks, mortality from inhalational anthrax was significantly lower than had been reported historically, which was attributed in part to early identification and timely treatment. During future attacks, clinicians will rely on published descriptions of the clinical features of inhalational anthrax to rapidly diagnose patients and institute appropriate treatment. Published descriptions of typical inhalation anthrax usually include patients presenting with cough, dyspnea, or chest pain and found to have abnormal lung examination results with pleural effusions or enlarged mediastinum. The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether atypical presentations of inhalational anthrax occur and to describe the features of these presentations. We define atypical presentations as those in patients with confirmed anthrax infection who do not have known cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or inhalational ports of entry. We reviewed the case reports of 42 patients with atypical anthrax (published between 1900 and 2004) that may have had an inhalational source of infection to evaluate whether their clinical presentations differed from the typical findings of inhalational anthrax. Patients with atypical anthrax were less likely to have cough, chest pain, or abnormal lung examination results than patients with typical inhalational anthrax (P < .05 for all comparisons). A previously published screening protocol for patients with suspected anthrax correctly identified 91% of patients with atypical presentations. We conclude that although uncommon, atypical presentations of inhalational anthrax likely occur. Timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with inhalational anthrax require clinical awareness of the full spectrum of signs and symptoms associated with inhalational anthrax.

### Appropriate use criteria for lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid testing in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^117DbGDV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Medium credibility.

Indication 6 (appropriate) — possible AD and atypical/mixed presentations: Possible AD includes atypical AD or mixed pathology, and atypical clinical presentations such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA, particularly logopenic variant) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) are most often but not always associated with AD pathology. Many studies have shown that CSF biomarkers indicate an AD profile in most cases of logopenic PPA and PCA, and CSF biomarkers can therefore provide information to help confirm or exclude AD in atypical presentations.

### Atypical SARS in geriatric patient [^1157fAGe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

We describe an atypical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a geriatric patient with multiple coexisting conditions. Interpretation of radiographic changes was confounded by cardiac failure, with resolution of fever causing delayed diagnosis and a cluster of cases. SARS should be considered even if a contact history is unavailable, during an ongoing outbreak.

### Kawasaki syndrome: an intriguing disease with numerous unsolved dilemmas [^1127rPkw]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Atypical and incomplete variants of the syndrome

Diagnosing and treating both "atypical" and "incomplete" forms of KS remain major dilemmas for clinicians evaluating children, especially infants, with prolonged or refractory high fever. Even after 5 years of age, the diagnosis of KS can be very hard to establish. According to the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, "atypical" KS is defined as a child with high fever and symptoms and signs heralding the onset of the disease that are not included in the clinical major criteria of KS, such as acute abdominal pain, pulmonary signs, or gastrointestinal signs. The more common atypical signs which can be observed in KS are listed in Table 2.

Table 2
Atypical findings of Kawasaki syndrome

Conversely, the term "incomplete" KS refers to patients who lack the clinical findings of the disease to fulfill the classic criteria, but present fever, at least two of the typical clinical manifestations and CAA revealed by echocardiography. It is clear that the presence of coronary damage detected by ultrasound investigations may confirm KS diagnosis in many doubtful cases.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^115Wo5bC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The complete protocol for this systematic review was established according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis) guidelines and using the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. The search was limited to manuscripts and reports on human subjects. No language restrictions were applied. The search for studies included articles up to October 1, 2024. We examined the references of included and excluded studies for additional studies. Inclusion criteria were as follows: reported clinical cutaneous or mucosal manifestations that eluded the usual clinical course of the disease with a detailed description of these manifestations. Case reports, cohort studies, clinical trials, and literature reviews were considered for inclusion. Articles lacking an adequate description of clinical manifestations or those not describing atypical manifestations of the disease were excluded. Two authors (AG and PH) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results and then the full texts to identify relevant studies for inclusion. Any conflicting decisions were resolved at this stage by discussion. Reference lists of included studies and other review articles were also searched. For the literature search we used the combination of the following keywords: 'mpox' or 'monkeypox'. We did not include 'cutaneous' or 'atypical' in our strategy to broaden the search results, as we carefully reviewed each article to select those that described an infrequent or atypical manifestation of the disease. Of the 5437 articles found, 136 articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in this review.

### Complexity in unclassified auto-inflammatory disease: a case report illustrating the potential for disease arising from the allelic burden of multiple variants [^114vd9UT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The past 20 years have seen the identification of numerous monogenic autoinflammatory diseases with systemic and/or organ-specific inflammatory features. These features include recurrent and episodic periodic fever, serositis, arthritis, cutaneous inflammation, heightened production of IL-1β and innate immune cell activation. Study of these monogenic "experiments of nature" with increasingly gene-agnostic DNA testing has extended our knowledge of the immune response, by identifying new disease-causing genes and inflammatory pathways. This process has markedly improved the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, and has informed treatment - especially for individuals with atypical presentations. Nevertheless, among patients with clinical signs and symptoms of systemic inflammatory disease, at least 40% do not fit any of the clinically-defined diseases, and approximately 50% have no known pathogenic mutation in genes that are annotated to this family of diseases. Thus, there is a clear need for more detailed investigation into disease etiology, through broader interrogation of genetic variants (exome or whole genome sequencing) and complementary translational research studies aimed at improved molecular and cellular phenotyping of disease. Here we present one such case, a boy with a severe and persistent systemic autoinflammatory disorder that, despite identification of rare genetic variants and functional immunologic abnormalities, does not fit any currently-described diagnostic entity.

### Atypical presentations of acute cerebrovascular syndromes [^112DorRx]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Correct diagnosis of acute stroke is of paramount importance to clinicians to enable selection of correct treatments and to ensure prevention of acute complications, including recurrent stroke. Timely diagnosis can be difficult in some cases because patients with acute stroke can present with atypical or uncommon symptoms that suggest another cause altogether. Publications on these patients suggest that the following strategies could help to reduce misdiagnosis. First, clinicians should suspect stroke in any patient with abrupt onset of neurological symptoms. Second, clinicians should be aware that some patients will initially present with various uncommon and atypical stroke symptoms. Third, a complete and systematic neurological examination should be routinely done in patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms because this might shed light on the true nature of the problem. Finally, clinicians should be aware that even with the most sophisticated neuroimaging tests, stroke might be missed in the early hours after the event.

### Atypical pneumonia: definition, causes, and imaging features [^111Dk6Ny]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is among the most common causes of death worldwide. The epidemiologic and clinical heterogeneity of pneumonia results in challenges in diagnosis and treatment. There is inconsistency in the definition of the group of microorganisms that cause "atypical pneumonia". Nevertheless, the use of this term in the medical and radiologic literature is common. Among the causes of community-acquired pneumonia, atypical bacteria are responsible for approximately 15% of cases. Zoonotic and nonzoonotic bacteria, as well as viruses, have been considered among the causes of atypical pneumonia in a patient who is immunocompetent and have been associated with major community outbreaks of respiratory infection, with relevant implications in public health policies. Considering the difficulty of isolating atypical microorganisms and the significant overlap in clinical manifestations, a targeted empirical therapy is not possible. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of atypical pneumonia, as in many cases its findings may first suggest the possibility of an atypical infection. Clarifying and unifying the definition of atypical pneumonia among the medical community, including radiologists, are of extreme importance. The prompt diagnosis and prevention of community spread of some atypical microorganisms can have a relevant impact on local, regional, and global health policies. © RSNA, 2021.

### Advancing precision medicine in inflammatory skin disease [^114uNUQw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Ambiguity in Inflammatory Skin Disease

Cases of inflammatory skin disease frequently display morphologic and microscopic features corresponding to more than one standard disease category. With multiple targeted treatments now available to treat defined diseases such as atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis, correctly classifying such ambiguous cases takes on greater importance. For instance, precision medicine can enable early targeted intervention, helping patients become 'super-responders' who achieve rapid, complete, and sustained skin clearance. Yet the very atypical features and heterogeneity of ambiguous cases typically exclude them from investigation in pharmaceutical drug trials and government-funded research initiatives, which both demand well-defined disease.

Such ambiguous cases likely represent at least two major phenomenological classes. Some simply illustrate atypical presentations of a canonical disease, resisting accurate diagnosis in the absence of more accurate clinical tests. Other cases with contradictory features may represent authentically complex and mixed pathology, arising from multiple molecular abnormalities, rather than the narrow derangements underlying a classic disease definition.

### Atypical diabetes: what have we learned and what does the future hold? [^112Px6mg]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

As our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes evolves, we increasingly recognize that many patients may have a form of diabetes that does not neatly fit with a diagnosis of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The discovery and description of these forms of "atypical diabetes" have led to major contributions to our collective understanding of the basic biology that drives insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and islet autoimmunity. These discoveries now pave the way to a better classification of diabetes based on distinct endotypes. In this review, we highlight the key biological and clinical insights that can be gained from studying known forms of atypical diabetes. Additionally, we provide a framework for identification of patients with atypical diabetes based on their clinical, metabolic, and molecular features. Helpful clinical and genetic resources for evaluating patients suspected of having atypical diabetes are provided. Therefore, appreciating the various endotypes associated with atypical diabetes will enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate targeted treatment decisions.

Differential diagnosis

As with many other febrile rashes, the diagnosis of TF is not straightforward because of the similarity of its main symptoms with other diseases. When considering the exanthem, the most common differential diagnoses are HFMD, Monkeypox, and Varicella. The intense generalized pain and Flu-like symptoms brought to eliminate Dengue, also Dengue present with fever initially but rash appears in the late stage of disease, Chikungunya, Zika, or COVID-19, as shown in Table 1.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^1152eDbo]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

This case report presents a detailed analysis of a 31-year-old male patient who presented with a complex array of clinical symptoms, including proteinuria, hematuria, edema, and kidney insufficiency. Despite undergoing multiple tests, the results for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies yielded negative findings. Subsequently, kidney biopsy pathology revealed a distinct diagnosis of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with membrane hyperplasia. Treatment was initiated with a comprehensive approach involving high doses of corticosteroids therapy and cyclophosphamide (CTX). However, contrary to expectations, the patient's kidney function exhibited rapid deterioration following this therapeutic regimen. The culmination of these complications necessitated a pivotal transition to maintenance hemodialysis. This case underscores the intricate challenges associated with diagnosing and managing rare and atypical presentations of kidney disorders. The negative anti-GBM antibody results and subsequent identification of atypical anti-GBM nephropathy highlight the need for tailored diagnostic strategies to discern subtle nuances within complex clinical scenarios. Additionally, the unexpected response to the treatment regimen emphasizes the potential variability in individual patient responses, underlining the necessity for vigilant monitoring and adaptable treatment strategies. This case report contributes to the evolving understanding of atypical kidney pathologies and the complexities involved in their management.

### Rheumatologic manifestations of hepatic diseases [^1124sHPt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The course of hepatic diseases may be complicated by a multitude of rheumatologic manifestations, which can complicate the diagnostic approach and alter the natural history of primary liver disease, sometimes worsening prognosis due to associated multiple organ dysfunction. These manifestations can occur in association with a multitude of liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hemochromatosis, or Wilson's disease. It is necessary not only for rheumatologists, but also for other clinicians, to be aware that these atypical manifestations may reflect an undiagnosed hepatic disease. On the other hand, it is crucial that, in a patient with known hepatic disease presenting with rheumatologic symptoms, an accurate distinction be made between the rheumatologic manifestations of hepatic disease and primary rheumatologic disease, since the treatment is often different. This review aims to summarize the current evidence regarding rheumatologic manifestations of hepatic diseases, how to distinguish them from primary rheumatologic disorders, and how to provide adequate management.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^113SLSi5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) seek to aid clinical decision making by recommending specific interventions for common clinical conditions or problems, and when well chosen and properly implemented they may result in improved patient outcomes. CPGs have typically been based on a synthesis of available clinical research, but as efforts to minimize bias have grown, development has increasingly depended on statisticians and methodologists in addition to clinician expertise, a shift that likely decreases bias but may also reduce clinical relevance and applicability; ideally, development would include both content experts and methodologists. Beyond traditional evidence hierarchies, more recent efforts acknowledge that other factors are important for determining the strength of a recommendation, and CPGs are generally designed to assist with treatment decisions for typical presentations of common disorders, whereas individual patients often present with a variety of conditions or atypical manifestations.

### Extrapulmonary and atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 [^114L6TXi]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has led to an outbreak of multiple cases of pneumonia in Wuhan city in December 2019. The disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 or "COVID-19", which was declared by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic in March 2020. It typically presents with respiratory symptoms and febrile illness. However, there are few reported extrapulmonary and atypical presentations, such as hemoptysis, cardiac, neurological, gastrointestinal, ocular, and cutaneous manifestations, as well as venous and arterial thrombosis. Lack of awareness of these presentations might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and isolation of suspected patients which increases the risk of transmission of infection between patients and doctors. All these issues will be discussed in this review.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether age‐related comorbid neuropathologies serve as a substrate for atypical presentations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and whether they contribute to the more rapid clinical decline observed in atypical AD compared to typical cases. AD neuropathological changes, that is, a stereotypical accumulation of beta‐amyloid plaques and phospho‐tau neurofibrillary tangles, usually manifest clinically as a progressive amnestic predominant syndrome, with or without dysexecutive features. In the past few decades, clinicopathological studies demonstrated that AD pathology can also manifest as nonamnestic clinical syndromes, collectively known as atypical AD. These syndromes include a behavioral variant (bvAD)in which many cases also meet criteria for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome (CBS), logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), posterior cortical atrophy syndrome (PCA), and a primary dysexecutive syndrome. Atypical AD presentations are enriched in early‐onset (EOAD) (< 65 years of age) cases, are mostly nonfamilial and have a weaker risk association than typical cases with apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele genotype.

Three primary factors may contribute to the atypical AD presentation: quantitative regional disparities in the abundance of plaques and/or tangles, intrinsic factors that affect resilience and vulnerability (e.g. inherent anatomical variation, genetic background), and neuropathological comorbidity. Post mortem brain neuropathology studies and tau PET imaging studies, including those conducted by our research group, have consistently identified a robust correlation between regional tau burden and atypical AD manifestations. In contrast, the influence of variations in plaque distribution appears to be modest at best. Relatively little is known about the contribution of genetic or anatomical variations, although there have been reports of an association between dyslexia diagnosis and lvPPA, and specific genetic risks associated with atypical AD syndromes, Neuropathological comorbidity frequently leads to unexpected symptoms, atrophy patterns, and accelerated clinical decline in neurodegenerative conditions. The frequency of comorbid neuropathology in AD is significant, extending to sporadic EOAD cases. However, the potential role of comorbid neuropathological alterations in explaining atypical AD presentations remains largely uncharted, primarily due to the absence of biomarkers capable of in vivo detection of non‐AD neurodegenerative changes and the scarcity of atypical AD cases in most brain repositories. The present study aims to address this gap by investigating the association between common comorbidities, longitudinal clinical/cognitive trajectories, and the clinical phenotype of AD in a well‐characterized clinicopathological cohort of primary AD cases.

### Vasculitis mimics and other related conditions [^116NoZuM]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The approach to diagnosis of primary systemic vasculitis can be challenging, often requiring consideration of important secondary causes of vasculitis and non-inflammatory mimics. An atypical pattern of vascular involvement and/or atypical features of primary vasculitis (eg, cytopenia, lymphadenopathy) should prompt a more thorough investigation into other diseases. Herein, we review selected mimics organized by the size of blood vessels typically affected.

### Atypical manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV in north Ethiopia: a gap in guidelines for the management of opportunistic infections in resource poor settings [^111XAg5h]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

In regions where it is endemic, visceral leishmaniasis is an important opportunistic infectious disease in people living with HIV. Typically, clinical presentation of visceral leishmaniasis includes chronic fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss. In Leishmania infantum endemic regions in Europe, atypical visceral leishmaniasis presentations have been well documented, with almost every possible organ involved. However, such reports are rare in Leishmania donovani endemic regions such as east Africa. In this Personal View, we describe the various atypical disease presentations in patients screened as part of an HIV and visceral leishmaniasis clinical trial in north Ethiopia, where up to 40% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis are co-infected with HIV. Atypical presentations such as these are not covered in clinical guidelines used in these settings. Apart from the lack of diagnostic facilities, this gap contributes to the underdiagnosis of atypical visceral leishmaniasis, with associated morbidity and mortality. Involvement of clinicians experienced with the management of HIV and visceral leishmaniasis co-infection in the development of HIV clinical guidelines in affected regions is warranted.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^112e4AmS]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — atypical presentation and diagnostic consideration: It is suggested that the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy be considered in patients with atypical findings such as deltoid weakness, scapular winging, weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, chest or deep breast pain, and headaches. Atypical symptoms and signs are often present in patients with cervical radiculopathy, and can improve with treatment. Grade of Recommendation: B.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: the role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, because of some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, and emphasizes the key points that assist in the differentiation of the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

### Comprehensive review of typical and atypical pathology of the appendix on CT: cases with clinical implications [^1172MiZg]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the United States with approximately 250,000 cases annually. Computed Tomography (CT) has emerged as the most accurate diagnostic test to triage these patients for emergent surgery. Although the radiology search pattern is prioritized to detect an inflamed appendix, not all appearances equate to a typical surgical appendicitis. There are a select set of atypical pathologies involving the appendix that have subtle differences on CT, but can have catastrophic complications if treated with emergent appendectomy. This paper will review the spectrum of CT appearances and clinical management for typical and atypical appendiceal pathologies.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — history, physical, and laboratory workup should include determination of B symptoms defined as unexplained recurrent fevers > 38°C within the last month, drenching night sweats within the last month, and weight loss of > 10% of body weight within 6 months of diagnosis, with examination of lymphoid regions and spleen. Essential tests include complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C‑reactive protein, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. A pregnancy test should be performed before individuals of childbearing potential undergo treatment, and HIV and hepatitis B and C testing are encouraged for patients with risk factors for HIV or unusual disease presentations. An immunodeficiency workup should also be considered for patients < 5 years of age, those with recurrent infections, those with an atypical presentation, and those with a personal or family history of immunodeficiency.

### An atypical case of creutzfeldt-jakob disease mimicking frontotemporal dementia: genotypic influence and clinical implications [^113H3r1F]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD) is a rapid progressive dementia related to the conversion of the prion protein (PrPC) into a misfolded form (PrPSc) which accumulates in neuronal cells leading to intracellular spongiform changes and neuronal loss. Clinical presentation in CJD is extremely heterogeneous mimicking other diseases, MRI and RT-QuiC approved in the current criteria have improved the diagnostic efficiency. We present a case worth reporting for its atypical presentation, mimicking frontotemporal dementia instead of classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^111DaosN]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease) is a form of small-vessel vasculitis characterized by the deposition of circulating anti-GBM antibodies within kidney and/or lung tissue. This condition is characterized by the deposition of circulating anti-GBM antibodies within the basement membranes of glomeruli and, at times, the pulmonary alveoli, leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, occasionally, pulmonary hemorrhage. However, the clinical and pathological manifestations of anti-GBM disease are not uniform across all cases. Classic anti-GBM disease, often referred to as Goodpasture's syndrome, primarily involves the kidneys and lungs. The autoimmune response targets the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, a major component of glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. The ensuing immune complex deposition triggers a cascade of inflammation, resulting in crescentic glomerulonephritis and, in severe cases, pulmonary hemorrhage. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are essential for favorable outcomes, typically relying on the detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies and subsequent kidney biopsy to assess disease extent.

Atypical anti-GBM disease is a rare and intriguing kidney disorder that presents with unique clinical and diagnostic challenges. Unlike classical anti-GBM disease, atypical cases deviate from the conventional presentation, making timely diagnosis and effective management paramount. Atypical anti-GBM disease typically exhibits milder clinical manifestations. Firstly, unlike the 34–62% incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage observed in typical anti-GBM disease, atypical cases often lack pulmonary hemorrhage. Notably, Nasr et al. have reported none of the 20 patients with atypical anti-GBM disease presented with pulmonary hemorrhage. Secondly, kidney damage in atypical anti-GBM disease tends to be less severe, primarily characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and mild kidney insufficiency. This stands in contrast to the acute progressive nephritis syndrome observed in typical anti-GBM disease. The serum creatinine for patients with atypical anti-GBM disease was 2.2 mg/dL, and none of them required dialysis. This suggests that kidney damage is notably milder in comparison to patients with typical anti-GBM disease. Lastly, individuals with atypical anti-GBM disease commonly exhibit negative or low titers of anti-GBM antibodies circulating in their blood, in contrast to patients with typical anti-GBM disease who demonstrate a positive rate ranging from 65–100%.

### Diagnostic reasoning in challenging cases [^111XnzX9]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning relies on cognitive heuristics to recognise patterns of symptoms and signs in order to arrive at a diagnosis. These rules of thumb allow us to rapidly diagnose common conditions that present in typical ways. However, they may lead us astray when common conditions present atypically or when a patient has a rare condition or multiple conditions causing their constellation of symptoms, signs, and test results, rather than having a single diagnosis to explain them all. This article describes strategies to help counteract diagnostic pitfalls, to expand diagnostic possibilities and to make diagnostic progress with complex, multielement cases.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis-many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort, organised by The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008, provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings (so-called red flags) suggestive of alternative diagnoses. Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, CNS inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings; studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted. Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### Atypical spinal tuberculosis [^114suCBc]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Typical spinal tuberculosis is readily diagnosed and treated. Certain atypical clinical and radiologic presentations of spinal tuberculosis are described. Failure to recognize these presentations may lead to delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. In some atypical forms of the disease, this may have disastrous consequences. The current authors present a new classification for atypical spinal tuberculosis and describe the various presentations. The role of advanced imaging studies such as computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging and imaging-guided aspiration cytology is discussed.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease: an update for the pediatric dermatologist [^115eMfcm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Kawasaki disease is easily diagnosed when it presents in its complete form, but because not all characteristic symptoms are always present at the same time, and the diagnosis of incomplete and atypical Kawasaki disease is often challenging, a delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis often occurs. We present the diagnostic approach to Kawasaki disease with common pitfalls and explain how to avoid them. We also describe current practice and new trends in treatment.

Typical vs A Typical AD Presentations

The most common clinical presentation of AD is one of a slowly progressive amnestic syndrome. However, a proportion of patients present with atypical phenotypes. These include dysfunction in visual, language, executive, behavioural, or motor domains. Early-onset AD is defined as symptoms onset before the age of 65 years. Atypical presentations are more common in early-onset AD. Much of clinical diagnosis within medicine is based on pattern recognition. The combination of a younger onset, in itself rare and an atypical presentation may lead to a reduction in such cases of AD being identified and a subsequent delay in diagnosis. In a cohort of young-onset cases with neuropathological AD confirmation, there was a misdiagnosis rate of 53% of those with atypical presentations versus 4% of patients with a more typical presentation.

Clinical Assessment

The quality of the clinical assessment and access to a comprehensive history will impact on the pre-test probability of a diagnosis of AD. This can prove challenging when patients attend clinic on their own or may not have an available or reliable informant. Access to a collateral history is essential to making a diagnosis of AD. Patients with cognitive impairment are less likely to be able to convey information regarding their premorbid level of function and cognition and how this has changed over time. In addition, the patient may lack insight into the degree of difficulties they are experiencing. Despite collateral history being a cornerstone of diagnostic assessment, there is little research in the field or formal guidance on how to take a thorough collateral informant history. There are some scales, such as the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) which have guidelines and training. In a UK audit of dementia care, out of those classified as having dementia, only one-third had an informant history recorded.

In one study which used simulated case vignettes, clinicians were presented with a range of clinical scenarios along with CSF AD biomarkers results. If the clinicians were shown an AD clinical presentation and consistent AD CSF results, this resulted in a significantly increased odds of an AD diagnosis. However, if clinicians were provided with borderline CSF values, they instead relied on other clinical information to reach a final diagnosis. When clinicians viewed a mild AD clinical presentation with normal CSF results, the diagnosis they picked was one of unknown aetiology. Finally, when clinicians were given an ambiguous clinical presentation with AD CSF biomarker results, there was an increased likelihood to give an AD diagnosis. These cases highlight both the impact of investigation results on final diagnosis, but more importantly the need to interpret the investigation result in the context of the overall clinical picture.

### Atypical diabetes: a diagnostic challenge [^114TTGXf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

In medical school, we learned how to classify diabetes according to different clinical characteristics. However, at the dawn of the precision medicine era, it is clear that today's clinical reality does not always align well with textbook teachings. The terms juvenile versus elderly-onset diabetes, as well as insulin-dependent versus non-insulin-dependent diabetes, have become obsolete. Contrary to what is often taught severe ketoacidosis may occur in type 2 diabetes. Patients may also suffer from two or more forms of diabetes simultaneously or consecutively. Five authentic cases of diabetes with uncommon characteristics that pose diagnostic challenges are presented here.

### Clinical asthma syndromes and important asthma mimics [^111RtnWE]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes. Phenotypes can be grouped into clinical or physiological, trigger-defined, and inflammatory phenotypes. Treatment based on inflammatory phenotyping improves clinical measures of asthma morbidity. Further study of individual asthma phenotypes will improve understanding of their immunologic and pathologic characteristics and improve diagnosis and therapy. Because asthma is a common disorder with nonspecific presenting features, other disorders are often misdiagnosed as asthma. A high index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses must be maintained when evaluating a patient who presents with clinical features suggestive of asthma, particularly if the patient presents with atypical symptoms or fails to respond to therapy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113mHrmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical clinical features in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD and people with diabetes and CKD may have increased risks of testing and treatments (Moderate). Evaluation of a person with atypical features should include additional diagnostic testing in selected cases, depending on the clinical presentation; for example, refractory hypertension and/or a significant decrease in kidney function after RAS blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney function and/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if nephrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence of other systemic disease should raise concerns about nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosis of these diseases may require invasive testing or interventional procedures, administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in other people, and in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, SOGC 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- symptoms of endometriosis may vary, but certain hallmark symptoms may be more likely to suggest endometriosis; recognize the atypical presentations

- endometriosis can be a chronic, relapsing disorder, which may necessitate a long-term follow-up

- adolescent patients with endometriosis are more likely than adult patients to present with acyclic pain

- physical examination of adolescent patients with endometriosis will rarely reveal abnormalities, as most will have early-stage disease

- endometriosis in adolescent patients is often early-stage and atypical.

### The diagnosis of sarcoidosis [^113TpXT3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the diagnostic approach to sarcoidosis. There is no gold standard diagnostic test, procedure or algorithm for sarcoidosis. The diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical presentation, histologic findings of granulomatous inflammation, exclusion of alternative diseases, and evidence of systemic involvement. Occasionally, there may be exceptions to several of these requirements.

Recent Findings

The diagnostic specificity of several specific clinical features are discussed. Typical histologic findings of sarcoidosis are described. Several diseases that may mimic sarcoidosis are reviewed.

Summary

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis usually involves weighing the clinical evidence for and against the diagnosis, coupled in most cases with histologic evidence of granulomatous inflammation. This approach requires knowledge of the varied presentations of the disease and other alternative conditions as well as histologic examination of an affected tissue in most instances.

Amyloid PET — appropriate indications state that the use of amyloid PET is considered appropriate in patients with any of the following conditions: persistent or progressive unexplained mild cognitive impairment (MCI); core clinical criteria for possible AD are satisfied but there is an unclear clinical presentation — either an atypical clinical course or an etiologically mixed presentation; or progressive dementia with atypically early age of onset (usually defined as 65 years or less in age).

### Atypical parkinsonism: an update [^1146dJRt]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

The knowledge obtained recently on atypical parkinsonian conditions points out clearly what are the major deficits in this field, which, compared to other neurodegenerative diseases, lacks major advances in terms of early diagnosis and treatments. With the expanding phenotypical spectrum of atypical parkinsonian conditions, the early identification of patients has become difficult; thus, new clinical criteria are being currently revised. The inability of conventional methods such as MRI to identify these disorders earlier and better than clinicians, and the recent failure of promising therapeutic compounds based on rational therapeutic hypotheses highlight the fact that the lack of biomarkers is probably the greatest limitation for developing treatments for these disorders. Thus, current and future research in this direction will be crucial.

### Atypical pneumonia – time to breathe new life into a useful term? [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens, or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

### Novel WT1 and ACTN4 co-mutations in a patient with denys-drash syndrome and an atypical, potentially attenuated presentation of nephropathy: a case report [^115JKMwi]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this case, we present a patient with an atypical presentation of DDS characterized by delayed nephropathy in the presence of novel WT1 and ACTN4 mutations, suggesting the potential for a new genotype-phenotype relationship or the attenuation of disease behavior. When diagnostic testing is limited due to increased risk to the patient, we emphasize the need for personalized treatment plans and a multimodal approach with close monitoring in the long-term management of such complicated cases. This case documents novel mutations, highlights the importance of genetic testing, and justifies further investigation into the relationship between genotype and phenotype for patients with mutations contributing to renal pathology.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a well-known inflammatory disorder that, despite its classic description, can pose a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of a 3-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with a limp and urinary incontinence who was ultimately diagnosed with KD. She was found to have a large coronary artery aneurysm on echocardiogram. We discuss the challenges in diagnosing incomplete KD.

### Diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus: has the time come? [^116Ye2XF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan disease with protean manifestations. Because SLE is uncommon and heterogeneous, its diagnosis can pose a considerable challenge, especially for clinicians with limited expertise of the disease. This is particularly true at the early stages of SLE, when an inadequate number of features to secure the diagnosis might be present, and for patients presenting with uncommon features, which can nonetheless be severe and require prompt treatment. Furthermore, the suboptimal performance of immunological testing in patients referred for possible SLE has been highlighted. As a result, SLE remains largely a clinical diagnosis that is made after excluding alternative diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria can expedite diagnosis and treatment, but are not available for SLE. Thus, SLE classification criteria are often used, but strict adherence to these criteria could delay diagnosis. Therefore, while eagerly awaiting diagnostic criteria for this disease, we propose interim potential solutions to facilitate its diagnosis.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^112enyXP]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Every neurologist will be familiar with the patient with atypical spinal cord disease and the challenges of taking the diagnosis forward. This is predominantly because of the limited range of possible clinical and investigation findings making most individual features non-specific. The difficulty in obtaining a tissue diagnosis further contributes and patients are often treated empirically based on local prevalence and potential for reversibility. This article focuses on improving the diagnosis of adult non-traumatic, non-compressive spinal cord disorders. It is structured to start with the clinical presentation in order to be of practical use to the clinician. We aim, by combining the onset phenotype with the subsequent course, along with imaging and laboratory features, to improve the diagnostic process.

### Viral exanthems: an update [^114UoADN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Classic viral exanthems, such as measles, rubella, and Fifth disease, have great historical significance and, despite vaccine successes, still occur both in the United States and across the world. Because they are either less commonly seen (e.g., measles) or recognized by pediatricians (e.g. Fifth disease), viral exanthems that present to dermatology clinics are often "atypical" and may cause diagnostic confusion. This article will first review a general approach to the patient with a possible viral exanthem, discuss several current issues germane to "classic" exanthems, and delve into greater detail regarding atypical presentations.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^111KxiXX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Atypical or rapidly progressive presentations — urgent evaluation and specialist referral guidance includes that delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management. Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities, sensorimotor impairment, or profound mood and behavioral symptoms, and patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing or studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in cognitive–behavioral neurology or geriatric psychiatry. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### Evidence-based guideline summary: evaluation, diagnosis, and management of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice issues review panel of the American association of neuromuscular&electrodiagnostic medicine [^116awegn]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) focuses on FSHD1 molecular confirmation when presentations are atypical; clinicians are advised that "Clinicians should obtain genetic confirmation of FSHD1 in patients with atypical presentations and no first-degree relatives with genetic confirmation of the disease (Level B)". FSHD1 results from D4Z4 repeat contraction "on 1 copy of 4q35 from > 10 repeats to 1–10 repeats", and available testing "is highly sensitive and specific". When strict criteria are not followed, confirming that a contraction is on an A-variant background "is warranted when the clinical presentation is atypical", and "commercial genetic testing in FSHD is limited to FSHD1 testing".

### Atypical features and systemic associations in extensive cases of grover disease: a systematic review [^113d2TnC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Grover disease is an acantholytic disorder that typically occurs on the trunk of older individuals, primarily white men, in association with heat and xerosis. Cases with extensive and/or atypical distributions have been reported.

Objective

To review the literature characterizing the population, morphology, associations, and disease course of extensive or atypical eruptions of Grover disease.

Methods

A systematic literature review identified 50 articles with 69 cases.

Results

Patient age ranged from 14 to 83 years (mean age, 56 ± 15), with 71% of patients being male and 29% female. Areas of involvement included the trunk (90%), upper and lower extremities (63% and 61%, respectively), face/scalp (28%), neck (21%), groin (11%), buttocks (8%), and axillae (6%). The most common associations included a history of malignancy (61%), recent chemotherapy (38%), and recent transplant (20%).

Limitations

Extensive cases with typical clinical morphology may not have been examined by biopsy or reported; thus, this review may have publication bias toward more severe or atypical presentations.

Conclusions

Greater variability exists among patients affected by extensive or atypical Grover disease than among those with typical disease. Malignancy is a common association, and there may be a role for immunosuppression in the pathogenesis of extensive or atypical Grover disease.

### Introduction [^113DMdZJ]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2017). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) themes in cystic fibrosis (CF) state that CFTR mutations have significant impact on epithelial surfaces throughout the GI tract, altering salt, water, and pH balance and leading to pathophysiologic cascades unique to people with CF that necessitate management approaches different than those for the general population. Because of this altered pathophysiology, many disease presentations in people with CF are different and distinct from those observed in the general population, and early recognition of these atypical presentations may be critically important to management and long-term outcomes. As people with CF are living longer as a result of clinical advances in care, long-term consequences of impaired CFTR function together with intrinsic, extrinsic, environmental, and medication effects and chronic inflammation may be part of the pathophysiology leading to an increased incidence of GI cancers, and clinicians must be cognizant of these factors as people with CF live longer and the early detection of GI malignancies becomes increasingly important.

### Approach to diagnosing and managing granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease [^112PbZQ3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Atypical manifestations

Understanding atypical presentations of GLILD is essential for identifying patients with unusual imaging patterns and differentiating them from other lung diseases.

A small subset of GLILD may have an upper lung predominance or diffuse distribution of typical findings, which may prompt consideration of other lung diseases. However, these atypical features do not exclude the diagnosis of GLILD. Features typically seen in CVID-associated airways disease are also less common in GLILD. In GLILD, bronchiectasis is typically mild. Airway wall thickening, mosaic attenuation, mucus plugging, and tree-in-bud nodularity are also less commonly seen in the setting of GLILD. This contrasts with CVID-associated airways disease, where these are typical features.

Another atypical feature of GLILD is cavitary disease, although cavities can be seen with atypical and fungal infections. Pulmonary cysts are also atypical, and are more common in LIP. Lastly, lack of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly would be atypical (Table 2). Lymphadenopathy in GLILD is not typically calcified, and calcification may suggest other causes of lung disease, or a co-existing pulmonary process.

Table 2
Chest HRCT and histopathological GLILD pattern.

Imaging differential diagnosis

When the dominant pattern of GLILD is nodules with lymphadenopathy, the primary differential consideration is sarcoidosis (Fig. 2 c). However, the nodules of sarcoidosis are usually upper lobe predominant, in contrast to the lower lung predominance of GLILD, and consolidation or ground glass abnormality are not usually prominent. When the dominant pattern is multifocal ground glass or consolidation, the differential diagnosis would include organizing pneumonia, which is not usually associated with significant adenopathy or splenomegaly. Infectious pneumonia should be considered and excluded clinically. Lymphoma, a primary issue of concern in CVID, typically presents with progressively enlarging nodules or consolidation, in contrast to the fluctuating course of GLILD nodules. However, nodule biopsy may be necessary in some cases to exclude lymphoma.

### Atypical ulcers [^116XJRqt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical ulcers of the skin challenge the dermatologist with respect to recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment. The entire gamut of pathogenic categories including vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, genetic, medication-related, and infectious processes may give rise to atypical ulcers. By definition, these ulcers are unusual, and accurate diagnosis may ultimately require the clinician to violate the dictum that "common things are common". Atypical ulcers may present with features that the clinician has not previously encountered, or may present with seemingly typical features that actually mislead due to phenotypic mimicry. Because skin ulcers are inherently tissue-destructive, and may reflect an underlying systemic disease process, there is heightened urgency to achieving an accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapy.

### Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis: the many faces of presentation at initial CT scan [^112vP4wR]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a rare interstitial granulomatous disease that usually affects young adults who are smokers. Chest computed tomography (CT) allows a confident diagnosis of PLCH only in typical presentation, when nodules, cavitated nodules and cysts coexist and predominate in the upper and middle lungs.

Methods

This article includes a pictorial essay of typical and atypical presentations of PLCH at initial chest CT. Various appearances of PLCH are illustrated and possible differential diagnosis is discussed.

Results

PLCH can present with some aspecific features that may cause diagnosis of the initial disease to be overlooked or other pulmonary diseases to be suspected. In cases of nodule presentation alone, the main differential diagnosis should include lung metastasis, tuberculosis and other infections, sarcoidosis, silicosis and Wegener's disease. In cases of cysts alone, the most common diseases to be differentiated are centrilobular emphysema and lymphangiomyomatosis. Clinical symptoms are usually non-specific, although a history of cigarette smoking, coupled with the presence of typical or suggestive findings at imaging, is key to suspecting the disease. Atypical presentations require surgical biopsy for diagnosis.

Conclusions

The radiologist should be familiar with PLCH imaging features to correctly diagnose the disease or need for further investigation.

Teaching Points

- PLCH is a rare interstitial smoking-related disease that usually affects young adults.
- The typical first CT shows a mix of nodules, cavitary nodules and cysts in the upper-middle lungs.
- Atypical appearance, either cysts or nodules alone, mandates that other diagnoses be considered.
- Lung cystic involvement correlates with lung function abnormalities and predicts functional decline.
- Integration of the clinical history and imaging results is key to diagnosis.

### Beyond the classical triad: atypical presentations and regulatory T cell phenotyping in a cohort of IPEX patients [^116bww5Y]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although HSCT is the only curative therapeutic approach for IPEX syndrome, some patients with atypical or milder phenotypes may achieve disease control with immunomodulatory therapies such as sirolimus or abatacept, as recently reported by Gerbaux et al.

In conclusion, this study reports 12 additional genetically confirmed cases of IPEX syndrome, including patients with classical and atypical clinical presentations. Our findings expand the known phenotypic spectrum of this rare immune dysregulation disease. By providing detailed clinical, immunological, and genetic data, this study contributes to a better understanding of the variability of IPEX manifestations. Despite the clear definition of IPEX syndrome, diagnostic challenges persist due to the variability in the characteristic features. Consequently, the disease course often exhibits a high degree of variability, rendering it unpredictable. Individuals lacking the classical triad often necessitate genetic testing for accurate diagnosis. Moreover, our observations underscored the clinical variability among individuals even with the same genetic mutation highlighting the importance of genetic and functional analysis. By shedding light on the diverse clinical presentations and genetic underpinnings of the syndrome within this population, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of IPEX syndrome and may aid in refining diagnostic approaches and optimizing patient management strategies.

### Approach to the atypical wound [^114bnXEt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneity of atypical wounds can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges; however, as the prevalence of atypical wounds grows worldwide, prompt and accurate management is increasingly an essential skill for dermatologists. Addressing the underlying cause of an atypical wound is critical for successful outcomes. An integrated approach with a focus on pain management and patient engagement is recommended to facilitate enduring wound closure. Advances in treatment, in addition to further research and clinical training, are necessary to address the expanding burden of atypical wounds.

### Effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease [^111Upic3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Atypical presentations of celiac disease appear to be at least as common as is the classic presentation of steatorrhea, diarrhea, and weight loss.

Objective

We examined the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in a cohort of US patients with celiac disease.

Design

A follow-up survey was conducted in 215 patients who were evaluated at the University of Iowa from 1990 through 1997 as having biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The systematic survey asked detailed questions regarding gastrointestinal symptoms before and after the institution of a gluten-free diet in the patients, all of whom had been given the same dietary advice.

Results

The group consisted of 160 female and 55 male patients. Although diarrhea was the most frequent symptom in untreated celiac disease, steatorrhea occurred in only one-fifth of patients. Other complaints were common, and most responded to gluten exclusion. The benefit of gluten exclusion was equally apparent in men and women. Diarrhea responded in most patients, usually within days, and the mean time to resolution was 4 wk. Many patients had alternating diarrhea and constipation, both of which were responsive to the gluten-free diet. Most patients had abdominal pain and bloating, which resolved with the diet.

Conclusions

Celiac disease causes a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinicians must have a high level of suspicion to detect the atypical forms of celiac disease. With a gluten-free diet, patients have substantial and rapid improvement of symptoms, including symptoms other than the typical ones of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^1169WiGC]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 12 — Referral for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases — A patient with atypical findings or in whom there is uncertainty about how to interpret the evaluation, or that is suspected of having an early-onset or rapidly progressive cognitive–behavioral condition, should be further evaluated expeditiously, usually including referral to a specialist (Strength of Recommendation A). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered to be urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management, and atypical, rapidly progressive or early-onset (young age of onset, age < 65 years) dementias pose unique diagnostic and care challenges that may require comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and specialist assessment, interpretation, or management.

### Characteristics of disease-specific and generic diagnostic pitfalls: a qualitative study [^112CtJoV]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Using multiple sources, we identified a series of diagnostic error cases that we used to help characterize failures in the diagnostic process in primary care. We used these instances of opportunities to improve diagnoses to compile a list of disease-specific examples as well as create a generic taxonomy of the types of recurring scenarios and issues — vulnerabilities in the diagnostic process that we have termed diagnostic pitfalls. By exploring both traditional sources of diagnostic error cases, such as malpractice claims and organizational error reports, and more novel inputs, such as errors identified by specialists with patients referred by primary care physicians, we were able to compile a rich collection of cases to review for pitfalls.

We used 2 previously validated tools for classifying where in the diagnostic process (DEER) and why (RDC) these diagnoses were potentially challenging for clinicians. Similar to prior studies, we found that issues associated with diagnostic testing predominated (especially ordering [mainly failure to order], interpretation, and follow-up of abnormal results) and patient assessment (particularly in failure to consider a diagnosis, recognize disease severity or urgency, and recognize atypical disease presentation or one that mimicked or was masked by a competing diagnosis). As in earlier studies, many of these cases had overlapping and multifactorial issues, suggesting the need for a multifaceted approach to recognize and prevent such errors.

To make diagnoses more reliable, we need to enhance the ability of clinicians and systems to anticipate what can go wrong and build strategies to minimize vulnerabilities associated with these pitfalls. Compiling a list of potential pitfalls represents an essential first step for additional interventions. For instance, in addition to educational interventions focused on clinicians anticipating these pitfalls, such pitfalls could inform the development of decision-support interventions that warn clinicians in real time to avoid these errors.

A key feature of high-reliability organizations is continual awareness and worry about what can go wrong. In applying lessons from a retrospective review of errors, the distillation of recurring pitfalls can help frontline clinicians anticipate these pitfalls and thereby recognize and prevent future errors. Diagnostic pitfalls can potentially fulfill such a role, warning of diagnosis-specific risks as well as providing a more generalized awareness of omnipresent vulnerabilities inherent in uncertain diagnoses (Box). Nevertheless, because education and warnings are lower in the hierarchy of effectiveness of improvement interventions, operationalizing systems to enhance situational awareness and building safety nets to minimize such errors are also a necessity.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115T7z2g]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

### Diagnostic challenge: an atypical presentation of infective endocarditis [^111Cz1Bu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

It is recognised that infective endocarditis is frequently a challenging diagnosis to make, as it may present with a range of non-specific symptoms. A middle-aged man was admitted with an 8-day history of profuse non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. He had no medical history and no identifiable risk factors for infective endocarditis, and so this in combination with the patient's atypical symptoms presented a diagnostic challenge. The patient was eventually diagnosed with a Staphylococcus aureus right-sided infective endocarditis. This case report explores the events which led to this diagnosis and demonstrates a number of unique learning points. It also highlights the importance of maintaining an open mind and being prepared to revise an initial diagnosis in the face of medical uncertainty.

### Prognostic impact of atypical presentation in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus: results from a multicenter study [^112H5eZb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study is to assess the rate of atypical manifestations at onset in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate their effect on disease outcome.

Study Design

This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A manifestation was considered atypical if it was not included in the American College Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE but was reported in literature as associated with SLE. Unfavorable outcome was considered presence of organ damage in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index at the last available evaluation.

Results

One hundred patients were enrolled in the study; 24% presented atypical clinical features at onset. Univariate analysis showed a significant association of worse outcome variables with the presence of atypical manifestations at onset (P = 0.004), as well as renal involvement (P = 0.027). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that atypical manifestations at onset (P = 0.018), renal involvement at onset or during follow up (P = 0.024), and central nervous system disease involvement during follow up (P = 0.021) were independent predictors of poor prognosis.

Conclusions

Our data support a relatively high rate of atypical onset in pediatric SLE. Presence of atypical manifestations at presentation and early kidney disease correlate with poor outcome. Similarly, during follow-up, kidney and central nervous system diseases are associated with worse outcome.

### Syphilis: an unusual manifestation? [^112xRDG2]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a widely investigated infectious venereal disease with varied presentations frequently mimicking other diseases. It progresses in distinct, well-characterised stages: early (primary and secondary), latent, and late (tertiary), each stage having its own unique presentations. However, there has been increasing evidence of atypical presentations. We describe one such presentation of early syphilis in its secondary stage. A man in his late 20s presented with a rash (which is typical of the secondary stage) and with bone pain with multiple lytic lesions (which is rare in the secondary stage but more typical of the tertiary stage). The patient was successfully treated for secondary syphilis. On the basis of our case, and on analysis of other case reports and research of early-stage syphilitic bone involvement, we conclude that the true incidence of bone involvement in early-stage syphilis may be higher than has been previously appreciated, and thus may be under-recognised and underdiagnosed.

### Atypical presentations at risk for diagnostic errors in internal medicine: a scoping review [^114Zu4q8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about how atypical disease presentations lead to diagnostic errors. Better definitions of atypical presentations may improve our understanding. We aimed to describe how atypical presentations were defined in studies of diagnostic errors in internal medicine.

Methods

We included papers that described the association between atypical presentations in adult patients and diagnostic errors in internal medicine, indexed from database inception to July 31, 2025. We excluded case reports and conference abstracts. The data were extracted through MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv searches.

Results

We included 56 papers in this review. Thirty studies included a definition of atypical presentation, but there was a considerable heterogeneity among the definitions. Using basic qualitative content analysis, we developed a new approach (Primary, Suggestive, Uncommon, and Chameleon features-the PSUC approach) to describe clinical presentations and identified four patterns at high risk of diagnostic errors. Pattern 1 lacks Primary disease features (i.e., features always written in textbooks) but has Suggestive features (i.e., stimulating consideration of specific disease); Pattern 2 lacks Primary features but Suggestive and Uncommon features (i.e., uncommon but known features in specific disease) are present. Pattern 3 lacks Primary and Suggestive features but has Uncommon features and Pattern 4 is similar to 3 but with Chameleon features (i.e., primary features for other diseases).

Discussion

Atypical presentations in studies of diagnostic errors in internal medicine currently have high heterogeneity. A new approach to classify atypical presentations may be useful and warrants investigation in future research.

### An atypical presentation of tuberculous gumma heralding a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis: hindsight is 20 / 20 [^116coBDX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In the end, for clinicians operating in countries where TB is not endemic, it might be reasonable to consider TG, not only in the more typical cases of long-standing nodular or suppurating lesions that do not resolve after standard antibiotic regimens but also in cases of rapid-onset nodules in patients suffering from systemic symptoms, such as weight loss and malaise. Once a clinical suspicion is established, the diagnosis should be confirmed using multiple diagnostic strategies, including histology, PCR, cultures, and immunostaining, depending on their availability in the specific clinical and laboratory setting.

### Atypical presentation of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in a 25-year-old woman in the caribbean: a challenging diagnosis [^115bfutE]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 25-year-old woman presented a challenging diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Initial symptoms included dry cough and three minor Jones criteria (unabating fever (38.4°C, 0d), elevated acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein, 13d) and joint pain (monoarthralgia) in her neck (0d)). ARF was diagnosed only after presentation of two major Jones criteria (polyarthritis/polyarthralgia (16d) and erythema marginatum (41d)) and positive antistreptolysin O titre (44d). Parotid swelling, peripheral oedema, elevated liver enzymes and diffuse lymphadenopathy complicated the diagnosis. Throat swab, chorea and carditis were negative or absent. Atypical ARF is challenging to recognise. There is no diagnostic test and its presentation is similar to that of other diseases. While the 2015 Jones criteria modification increased specificity of ARF diagnosis, atypical cases may still be missed, especially by physicians in developed countries. Suspicion of atypical ARF, especially after travel to high incidence regions, would allow for earlier treatment and prevention of rheumatic heart disease.

### Atypical diabetes: a diagnostic challenge [^113Eu9ox]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

In medical school, we learned how to classify diabetes according to different clinical characteristics. However, at the dawn of the precision medicine era, it is clear that today's clinical reality does not always align well with textbook teachings. The terms juvenile versus elderly-onset diabetes, as well as insulin-dependent versus non-insulin-dependent diabetes, have become obsolete. Contrary to what is often taught severe ketoacidosis may occur in type 2 diabetes. Patients may also suffer from two or more forms of diabetes simultaneously or consecutively. Five authentic cases of diabetes with uncommon characteristics that pose diagnostic challenges are presented here.

### Atypical presentations of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1111ibGe]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease typically manifests as heartburn and regurgitation, but it may also present with atypical or extraesophageal symptoms, including asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis, hoarseness, chronic sore throat, dental erosions, and noncardiac chest pain. Diagnosing atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease is often a challenge because heartburn and regurgitation may be absent, making it difficult to prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Upper endoscopy and 24-hour pH monitoring are insensitive and not useful for many patients as initial diagnostic modalities for evaluation of atypical symptoms. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who have atypical or extraesophageal symptoms, aggressive acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors twice daily before meals for three to four months is the standard treatment, although some studies have failed to show a significant benefit in symptomatic improvement. If these symptoms improve or resolve, patients may step down to a minimal dose of antisecretory therapy over the following three to six months. Surgical intervention via Nissen fundoplication is an option for patients who are unresponsive to aggressive antisecretory therapy. However, long-term studies have shown that some patients still require antisecretory therapy and are more likely to develop dysphagia, rectal flatulence, and the inability to belch or vomit.

### IgG4-related lung disease as a differential diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disease: atypical presentation of an atypical disease [^1114AmnM]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immunomodulated inflammatory disease that usually affects the pancreas and parotid glands. Although lung involvement is rare, it has been recently reported and could mimic various other diagnoses. We present a case of IgG4-RD whose symptoms and images raised the suspicion of a malignant lymphoproliferative lung neoplasm. It is imperative to differentiate both diseases, since their treatment and prognosis vary.

### Why is amyloid-β PET requested after performing CSF biomarkers? [^1163m14f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Two methods are currently employed in the clinic to capture in vivo amyloid-β pathology, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ 42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect the soluble amyloid-β pool that has been shown to correlate with amyloid-β depositions in the brain. Alternatively, amyloid-β positron emission tomography (PET) can be employed to directly visualize parenchymal fibrillary amyloid-β depositions. Although CSF and PET yield conflicting results in 10–20% of patients, they are nonetheless considered interchangeable for clinical use.

In our center, all patients are offered CSF biomarker analysis. However, despite the availability of CSF biomarkers, occasionally amyloid-β PET-scans are requested. The diagnostic value of amyloid-β PET to a standard dementia screening has been established in many studies, but few studies have included subgroups of people with available CSF biomarkers. Reported reasons for performing amyloid-β PET in such cases included incongruent CSF biomarkers in patients with suspicion of AD or atypical clinical presentation. We aimed to elucidate this practice by exploring the clinical reasoning for requesting amyloid-β PET after CSF biomarkers were disclosed, and to characterize the population that received amyloid-β PET after CSF examination.

Additionally, appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid-β PET have been published to support the implementation of clinical amyloid-β PET, advocating use in three groups most likely to benefit: patients with an atypical clinical presentation or mixed etiology, persistent unexplained mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and unexplained dementia in young patients. As a secondary goal, we aimed to compare our clinical practice against current amyloid-β PET AUC.

### An atypical and bilateral presentation of Charcot foot disease [^113Aor6Q]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CNO) is one of the most devastating complications of neuropathy in patients with diabetes. Establishing diagnosis of CNO is difficult, due to the lack of clear clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria. Diagnosis is even more difficult when there is atypical and bilateral clinical presentation. Since CNO may lead to foot deformity, lower-extremity amputation and significant decrements in quality of life, it must be detected and treated without delay. Treatment focuses mainly on interruption of the inflammatory process and relief from pain using feet offloading devices. In more severe cases, surgical intervention may be needed. Additionally, the use of custom-made insoles and custom-made orthopaedic shoes is mandatory.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a young diabetic patient who presented to our clinic with bilateral and atypical presentation of Charcot foot disease. Patient was treated successfully upon diagnosis with bilateral aircast offloading. Unfortunately, due to depression and non-compliance, the disease progressed to severe and permanent lesions later on.

Conclusion

Despite the rareness of this disease, clinicians must include CNO into differential diagnosis of diabetic foot oedema, inflammation and deformity.

### Comorbid neuropathology and atypical presentation of Alzheimer's disease [^111MF6Uw]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

This study's strengths include the availability of well‐characterized longitudinal clinicopathological cohort and the relatively young age at death in the typical AD group (62 ± 11 years). This is particularly advantageous because the number of comorbid neuropathologies increases with age, thus comparing the frequency of comorbidities in atypical cases versus amnestic late‐onset AD will likely show that comorbidities are even less frequent in atypical cases. The predominance of end‐stage cases, an inherent limitation of most post mortem studies could be a potential limitation as it is challenging to determine when comorbid pathology emerged compared to AD pathology and progression. It is possible that atypical cases developed comorbid neuropathologies at an earlier disease stage than typical cases, explaining the atypical presentation, greater neocortical atrophy, and steeper decline. Still, the number of comorbid pathologies turned out to be small in the atypical cases, often limited to limbic areas, and we have demonstrated before that differences in regional tau burden in this cohort is a strong predictor of atypical presentation and syndrome‐specific worse neuropsychological scores. Also, our cohort lacks racial and ethnic diversity and was studied at a tertiary center with expertise in atypical and early‐onset dementia. This might introduce referral and selection biases and more diverse or community‐dwelling cohorts may show different results. While the atypical AD group is relatively large for a post mortem study, subgrouping reduced the sample sizes and analysis power. For instance, more cases of bvAD are necessary to power the analysis exploring the correlation between TDP‐43‐proteinopathy as a possible contributing neuropathological substrate of bvAD.

In conclusion, this study has presented compelling evidence suggesting that comorbid neuropathologies are unlikely to be a contributing factor for atypical presentation of AD pathology.

Thus far, it is regional variability in phospho‐tau burden that has emerged as the most robust predictor of an atypical AD presentation, or the absence of clinical symptoms. This underscores the need for further investigations into the intricate relationship between tau pathology and cellular intrinsic factors that may either amplify or mitigate the expected regional tau burden, thereby shedding light on the pathogenesis. Employing advanced single‐cell techniques in rigorously characterized atypical AD cases holds promise for unraveling the mechanisms underpinning this hypothesis, including potential disparities in neuroinflammatory patterns. The exploration of the neurobiological underpinnings of AD clinical phenotypes may pave the way for identifying pivotal pathogenic pathways and vulnerability factors, ultimately fostering the development of superior biomarkers and innovative therapeutic interventions for AD, which until today have remained solely focused on amyloid.

### Atypical presentation of thyroid storm: a diagnostic dilemma [^115BrZoF]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Thyroid storm (accelerated hyperthyroidism) is an uncommon life-threatening emergency. The diagnosis is difficult and at times delayed owing to atypical presentation. Early diagnosis is the key to its successful management. We came across a patient who had presentations of acute abdomen but later diagnosed in thyroid storm. Multiorgan involvement leads all resuscitative measures futile and prevented us to salvage the patient.

### Sarcoidosis: a diagnosis of exclusion [^113bxhdD]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. This article will review the typical and atypical imaging features of sarcoidosis, identify entities that may be mistaken for sarcoidosis, and discuss patterns and clinical scenarios that suggest an alternative diagnosis. CONCLUSION. Radiologists must be familiar with the characteristic findings in sarcoidosis and be attentive to situations that suggest alternative diagnoses. The radiologist plays a major role in prompt diagnosis and one that may help reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

### How doctors think: common diagnostic errors in clinical judgment-lessons from an undiagnosed and rare disease program [^113yhjdn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The scientific process of analysis and deduction is frequently, often subconsciously, used by physicians to develop a differential diagnosis based on patients' symptoms. Common disorders are most frequently diagnosed in general practice. Rare diseases are uncommon and frequently remain undiagnosed for many years. Cognitive errors in clinical judgment delay definitive diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing has helped identify the cause of undiagnosed or rare diseases in up to 40% of children. This article provides experiences with an undiagnosed or rare disease program, where detailed data accumulation and a multifaceted analytical approach assisted in diagnosing atypical presentations of common disorders.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^114yrrq5]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Since the apparition of the Kerala outbreak, there has been a debate about whether an emergent virus provoked the disease or not. The possibility of an entirely new virus was explored in the early days and then abandoned. Another hypothesis explored the possibility that the disease may have arisen as an after-effect of a Chikungunya or a Dengue infection. Did this theory consider it a complication of those diseases or a health condition of its own whose occurrence may be favored by the previous illness with Chikungunya or Dengue fever? This information was never specified, and this hypothesis was also considered unlikely. Nevertheless, the more recent and accepted explanation present TF as a variant of the Hand Foot Mouth disease (HFMD) caused by a virus from the Enterovirus family, the Coxsackie virus A-16. The HFMD is a well-known contagious viral exanthem affecting mainly the under-five. This disease can spread anytime during the year, but with a seasonal peak during summer and fall. Despite the atypical presentation of the cutaneous lesions of the Kerala outbreak, is it justified to rename the disease as a new one or consider it a variant of the HDFM as we are all used by now to the many variants of COVID-19? In his correspondence on 8/26/2022, Lucey argues against the use of a new name for a well-known virus. Still, the atypical presentation described in India raised question about the clinical difference between TF and HFMD. Therefore, studies and investigations about the biological and environmental conditions that may influence that change coupled with active surveillance of the disease symptomatology should bring more evidence.

### Emerging phenotype: maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY-5)-mechanisms, clinical spectrum, and unmet needs [^116odACx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The inadequacies in current diagnostic frameworks are particularly pronounced in diverse populations, where the interplay of genetic and demographic heterogeneity further complicates disease classification. Universal diagnostic algorithms often fail to capture the regional and population-specific variations that define the presentation of diabetes in different settings. For instance, genetic predispositions may vary significantly across ethnic groups, impacting the prevalence and presentation of Type 5 Diabetes. These challenges underscore the importance of developing population-specific guidelines and precision-based diagnostic algorithms that account for this variability, ensuring that care is equitable and effective across diverse patient groups.

Retrospective reclassification of existing pediatric diabetes cohorts and prospective validation of new diagnostic criteria are critical for addressing the challenges posed by Type 5 Diabetes. As emerging phenotypes continue to blur traditional classification boundaries, revisiting existing cases with advanced diagnostic tools can help identify previously misclassified individuals, providing new insights into the spectrum of the disease. Similarly, prospective validation of revised criteria is essential for ensuring that future cases are accurately diagnosed and appropriately managed. These efforts would represent a significant step toward reducing diagnostic errors and improving outcomes for children with rare diabetes subtypes.

A thorough investigation into the clinical manifestations and complications associated with Type 5 Diabetes is essential for optimizing care and improving outcomes. Early- and late-onset presentations of the disease often include atypical features — such as renal abnormalities, growth disturbances, and neurological deficits — that remain poorly understood. These complications are frequently linked to the pleiotropic effects of mutations like HNF1B and underscore the systemic nature of Type 5 Diabetes. Comprehensive phenotyping studies that document the full spectrum of associated features are necessary for enabling clinicians to recognize these atypical signs and intervene early, preventing irreversible damage and promoting better long-term health.

The clinical spectrum of Type 5 Diabetes, characterized by age-specific presentations and multisystem complications, challenges traditional diagnostic methods that rely heavily on classical symptomatology. Features such as renal cysts, pancreatic hypoplasia, and hypomagnesemia expand the differential diagnosis and necessitate greater attention to non-traditional symptoms during pediatric workups. These atypical presentations highlight the need for diagnostic protocols that go beyond overt hyperglycemia to encompass a broader range of clinical findings, ensuring that rare forms of diabetes are not overlooked in standard evaluations.

### Autoinflammatory diseases: mimics of autoimmunity or part of its spectrum? Case presentation [^116VJyBY]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autoinflammatory diseases are very rare diseases presenting within a wide clinical spectrum. Recognition of the main clinical features are challenging due to overlapping or mimicking with autoimmune diseases.

Discussion

A case series is reviewed to illustrate typical and atypical features and the difficulties of these diagnoses in the low prevalence areas — a typical unrecognized case of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in a youngster, an atypical adult case with overlapping of FMF with Behçet disease, and an early presentation of FMF in infant presenting with inflammatory colitis, as well as the overlapping features within the cryopirin diseases spectrum in an 8-year-old boy who presented with systemic onset arthritis.

Conclusion

These cases may represent examples of a very puzzling relationship among disorders of innate and adaptive immune systems and inflammation.

### Atypical presentations of primary acquired hypothyroidism-a case series [^114wNpXW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary acquired hypothyroidism in children manifests with a myriad of clinical presentations. Clinical features can be insidious in nature, often under the guise of non-specific presentations to other subspecialties prior to referral to the endocrinologist. Growth failure is a hallmark feature in these children alongside their presenting clinical symptomology which needs to be identified through detailed history, physical examination and analysis of the growth charts. In this case series, we discuss 5 atypical presentations of acquired primary hypothyroidism with multisystemic involvement, including musculoskeletal, hepatobiliary, gynaecological and haematological manifestations. This is of importance as untreated hypothyroidism leads to fatigue, decreased physical activity, suboptimal height gain, disordered puberty and poor neurocognitive development in children with long term detrimental outcomes.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^117L13yS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The dogmatic description of gout is described as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that afflicts peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout. Emphasis is placed on the ability of gout to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

Recent Findings

Various genetic mutations can predispose patients in developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Summary

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest as with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations are a result of a complexity of reasons. When presented with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, the clinician should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

### Atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis: a systematic review [^112pkbBT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis can present with atypical manifestations that delay treatment and risk severe complications.

Objectives

To comprehensively describe all atypical signs/symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

Design

In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to October 2022. Primary research articles that included at least one participant with an atypical sign/symptom of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis were included. Study screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with atypical giant cell arteritis features. Time to treatment was compared between participants with atypical giant features only and participants with both typical and atypical features.

Results

Of 21,828 screened records, 429 studies corresponding to 746 individuals (median [IQR] age 72 [IQR, 66–78] years, 63% female) with at least one atypical feature of GCA were included. Eighty-two percent had both atypical and at least one concurrent typical giant cell arteritis feature, whereas 18% of patients with atypical signs and symptoms only presented with atypical features. Patients with atypical symptoms presented to clinicians earlier than patients with typical features (p < 0.001). There was no difference between groups in proportion to elevated ESR and CRP (82.3% vs. 83.35%, p = 0.91) or mortality rate (8.2% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.42). Patients with atypical features only experienced greater delay in treatment initiation (p < 0.001). The most commonly reported atypical signs/symptoms were vertigo (11.9%), scalp necrosis/ulceration (7.9%), and dry cough (5.8%).

Conclusions

Eighteen percent of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis cases with at least one atypical feature have only atypical features and are more likely to experience delays in treatment. Clinicians should be aware of atypical signs/symptoms of giant cell arteritis and order inflammatory markers early to prevent giant cell arteritis-associated morbidity.

### Paraplegia: an unusual presentation of Ewing's sarcoma [^115s3RJZ]. Spinal Cord (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

Single-subject case.

Objectives

To describe the atypical presentation of a rare tumor and difficulties in diagnosis.

Setting

Spinal cord unit of a rehabilitation and care center in Ankara, Turkey.

Methods

A 22-year-old male patient with paraplegia was admitted to our center for rehabilitation. He underwent various diagnostic procedures to explain his clinical situation.

Results

Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a mass and vertebral destruction. The pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma.

Conclusion

Spinal cord compression is an important complication of primary or metastatic malignant tumors. Although it is a late complication in most cases, some tumors including Ewing's sarcoma may present with paraplegia. Trauma may be found in the patient's history. An atypical clinical course in a musculoskeletal or neurological condition should alert us to a possible underlying malignant disease.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111mSWtY]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### CT of atypical and uncommon presentations of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1135sfxg]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to familiarize radiologists with uncommon presentations of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with an emphasis on the CT spectrum of atypical appearances.

Conclusion

HCC is the fifth most common neoplasm worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. In many cases, HCC can be confidently diagnosed with noninvasive imaging. However, there are numerous unusual appearances of HCC with which the radiologist must be familiar.

### Unusual presentations of systemic lupus erythematosus: a narrative review [^1132D5Yw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an almost 10:1 female predominance, the presence of deleterious nuclear autoantibodies, a tendency for flare, and striking protean manifestations. Early diagnosis is associated with less damage accrual, lower costs, and improved quality of life due to timely treatment. However, early disease may not uncommonly show nonspecific presentation, a single classification criterion, or an unusual organ involvement contributing to frequent, often substantial diagnostic delays. We reviewed the literature (1982–2022) to accumulate and classify all reports of rare, atypical, and unusual presentations. These can involve almost every organ and system, and thus, present to physicians in every discipline and setting. Increasing physicians' awareness of the potential of occult SLE to appear in varied, diverse, and unexpected presentations, may encourage the inclusion of SLE in the differential. Informed history and examination focusing on systemic and joint symptoms and mucocutaneous involvement, and basic tests (focusing on leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria; followed by antinuclear antibodies and complement levels) will correctly diagnose most patients on presentation or within the following months and enable timely treatment.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mimics [^11179R1g]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of cortical, bulbar, and spinal motor neurons. When a patient presents with a progressive upper and/or lower motor syndrome, clinicians must pay particular attention to any atypical features in the history and/or clinical examination suggesting an alternate diagnosis, as up to 10% percent of patients initially diagnosed with ALS have a mimic of ALS. ALS is a clinical diagnosis and requires the exclusion of other disorders that may have similar presentations but a more favorable prognosis or an effective therapy. Because there is currently no specific diagnostic biomarker that is sensitive or specific for ALS, understanding the spectrum of clinical presentations of ALS and its mimics is paramount. While true mimics of ALS are rare, the clinician must correctly identify these disorders to avoid the misdiagnosis of ALS and to initiate effective treatment where available.

### Scleroderma and pseudo-scleroderma: uncommon presentations [^117BAi7e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Scleroderma is characterized by major clinical symptoms, but a number of unrelated disease may mimic these features more or less completely. Even scleroderma itself sometimes presents in an unusual manner. This article deals with uncommon presentations of true scleroderma and its variants and pseudo -scleroderma diseases.

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^112QkJzz]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of children with new and unusual lung infections is often non-specific. Therefore, imaging evaluation plays an important role in initial detection, follow-up for disease progression, and assessment of potential complications of new and unusual pediatric lung infections. Clear and up-to-date understanding of the imaging characteristics of unusual pediatric lung infections and potential mimics is essential for radiologists to provide an accurate and clinically useful differential diagnosis. This, in turn, can lead to timely diagnosis and optimal management of pediatric patients with unusual lung infections.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^1147A1uM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The varying clinical manifestations and atypical presentation can obscure accurate diagnosis, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the disease's mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. This case report outlines a patient presenting with edema and kidney dysfunction, later diagnosed with atypical anti-GBM disease. As we embark on an in-depth exploration of this enigmatic case, we endeavor to unravel the intricate connections between the diverse clinical features, laboratory findings, and potential underlying pathophysiology. By delving into the complexities of this presentation, we hope to contribute to the evolving understanding of atypical clinical scenarios, thereby enriching the realm of medical knowledge and clinical practice.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: interim guidance [^114rQ9Ve]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.
