## Question

Ezetimibe dose and duration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ezetimibe dose and duration, including when to start it, special population adjustments, hepatic impairment considerations, treatment duration and monitoring, combination therapy dosing, and safety profile monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult dose across indications. Then, I should verify initiation timing in statin-tolerant versus statin-intolerant patients. Next, I will review dose adjustments in renal function, age, gender, and race, followed by hepatic impairment nuances. After that, I should establish duration of therapy and monitoring intervals. Finally, I will examine combination therapy dosing and summarize the key safety monitoring elements with practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the standard adult dosing because everything else hinges on getting that right. Across labeled adult indications including primary and mixed hyperlipidemia, heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and homozygous familial sitosterolemia, the dose is consistently 10 mg orally once daily, which aligns with the unified FDA labeling and indication set [^112dZGs4] [^111dKNYA] [^113en2LS] [^1133w5rS] [^113vapEn] [^116CtQfz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to start it, I should double-check the guideline-driven initiation windows. In statin-tolerant patients whose LDL-C remains above target after about 4 to 6 weeks of maximally tolerated statin therapy, ezetimibe should be added, a recommendation that applies broadly including patients with ASCVD and ACS, familial hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease, and chronic coronary syndromes [^111WoJZk] [^115Qxm5F] [^117SeqmU] [^1128nNnC] [^116a7bxP]. For statin-intolerant patients, I need to ensure I capture that ezetimibe may be initiated immediately once statin intolerance is confirmed despite rechallenge, which the ESC/EAS guidance explicitly supports [^117NA1Er].

> Wait, let me verify dose adjustments across special populations before asserting there are none. For renal function, ezetimibe monotherapy requires no dose adjustment even with significantly reduced eGFR, and this is supported by FDA labeling that explicitly allows use across eGFR ranges without alteration, although myopathy risk considerations come from the statin component when used in fixed-dose combinations rather than ezetimibe itself [^113qkMvn] [^notfound] [^11294Mp8]. I should confirm age, gender, and race as well. Despite approximately twofold higher total ezetimibe exposure in adults aged 65 and over and small exposure differences by gender, no dose adjustment is recommended, and pharmacokinetics are similar across races, which reassures me the 10 mg daily dose is appropriate for these groups [^114Znikq] [^113MpRxR].

> I will now examine hepatic impairment, because that is the area where exposure changes can be clinically meaningful. For mild hepatic impairment corresponding to Child-Pugh A, exposure is increased around 1.7-fold but labeling does not require a dose change, which I should explicitly state, while for moderate to severe impairment corresponding to Child-Pugh B or C, exposure increases roughly three- to six-fold, so although no explicit reduced dose is provided, caution is warranted and many clinicians avoid initiation or proceed only with compelling indications and close monitoring [^113MpRxR] [^11668nxA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied there is a formal dose adjustment grid for Child-Pugh B or C, but there is not, so the correct approach is to emphasize caution and individualized risk assessment rather than a specific alternative dose [^113MpRxR].

> Next, I should review the appropriate duration of therapy and the monitoring cadence. Let me first confirm short- versus long-term data. The LDL-C lowering effect and tolerability are well established in 12-week randomized trials of monotherapy, while extended outcome data from IMPROVE-IT demonstrate cardiovascular benefit when ezetimibe is added to statin over a median 6-year follow-up, and long-term safety is supported by systematic reviews and observational cohorts up to approximately 7.7 years, which supports indefinite use to maintain LDL-C goals with routine lipid monitoring [^112LxuBB] [^115BT9ob] [^113bUEqX] [^115vgP2R]. I should double-check the earliest reasonable reassessment time and it remains appropriate to check LDL-C as early as about 4 weeks after initiation or changes, adjusting therapy accordingly [^11294Mp8].

> Let me consider combination therapy dosing next, since many patients will receive ezetimibe with a statin or other agents. The ezetimibe component remains 10 mg daily regardless of the statin dose, including in fixed-dose combinations, with simvastatin fixed-dose products typically capped at ezetimibe 10 mg with simvastatin 40 mg for new starts and 10 mg with simvastatin 80 mg only continued in those already tolerating it long-term, and with bempedoic acid fixed-dose combination the ezetimibe component is 10 mg alongside bempedoic acid 180 mg, all of which maintain the ezetimibe 10 mg anchor dose that was used across pivotal combination studies [^11294Mp8] [^116NamnL] [^115fbQqQ] [^116w7Akq] [^115BT9ob] [^113TEVL4] [^116y3Pr8]. Hold on, I should verify that these combinations demonstrably improve LDL-C relative to statin alone, and multiple randomized data sets show greater LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe plus statin versus statin monotherapy, which aligns with guideline strategies to intensify nonstatin therapy when targets are not met [^113TEVL4] [^111WoJZk] [^115Qxm5F].

> I need to ensure the safety and monitoring framework is clear and practical. Ezetimibe is generally well tolerated, with common adverse reactions including nasopharyngitis, myalgia, diarrhea, fatigue, and modest transaminase elevations, and labeled serious risks include increased liver enzymes, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis, particularly relevant when coadministered with statins, so baseline and symptom-triggered monitoring of liver enzymes and creatine kinase is reasonable while continuing routine lipid checks to guide efficacy [^116nqbfZ] [^1144DR3w] [^11294Mp8]. I should double-check rare or idiosyncratic events as well, and the label acknowledges uncommon reactions such as pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, and neuromuscular symptoms like myasthenia gravis, which should prompt reassessment if suspected [^1119GRZR].

> But wait, what if the clinician is considering ezetimibe solely for event reduction rather than LDL lowering. I should confirm that outcome data for ezetimibe are strongest in the post-ACS setting when added to statin therapy, with IMPROVE-IT demonstrating modest but significant reductions in major cardiovascular events, while guidelines still primarily frame ezetimibe use around hitting stringent LDL-C targets after maximizing statin therapy or when statins are not tolerated [^115BT9ob] [^111WoJZk] [^115Qxm5F] [^117NA1Er]. Let me reconsider how to phrase this so it is precise. Use ezetimibe to achieve LDL-C targets as per risk category and consider its established post-ACS outcome benefit when added to statin therapy, integrating shared decision-making for absolute risk reduction and treatment burden [^115BT9ob] [^111WoJZk].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the practical recommendations. Use ezetimibe 10 mg orally once daily across approved adult indications. In statin-tolerant patients who remain above LDL-C goals after about 4 to 6 weeks of maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe, whereas in statin-intolerant patients, initiate ezetimibe without delay. Do not adjust the dose for renal impairment, older age, gender, or race. In mild hepatic impairment, standard dosing is acceptable, but in moderate to severe hepatic impairment, exposure increases substantially and therapy should be considered with caution. Continue therapy long-term to maintain LDL-C targets, reassess LDL-C about 4 weeks after initiation or changes, and monitor for liver enzyme elevations and muscle symptoms, especially in combination with statins. In all combination regimens, the ezetimibe component remains 10 mg daily, including fixed-dose products with simvastatin or bempedoic acid [^112dZGs4] [^111WoJZk] [^117NA1Er] [^113qkMvn] [^113MpRxR] [^11668nxA] [^11294Mp8] [^115fbQqQ] [^115BT9ob] [^113bUEqX].

---

Ezetimibe is dosed at **10 mg once daily** [^112dZGs4] for all approved indications, with no dose adjustment needed for renal impairment [^113qkMvn] or mild hepatic impairment [^114Bet8L]. Treatment is **long-term and continuous** [^113bUEqX] to maintain LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction [^115BT9ob], with lipid reassessment at 4–6 weeks [^111WoJZk] and periodic monitoring thereafter. Discontinue if persistent ALT elevations ≥ 3× ULN or myopathy occur [^1144DR3w].

---

## Recommended dose

- **Standard dose**: 10 mg once daily [^112dZGs4] for all approved indications [^113en2LS] [^111dKNYA].
- **No dose adjustment**: Renal impairment [^113qkMvn] or mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [^11668nxA].
- **Moderate/severe hepatic impairment**: Not recommended due to increased exposure [^113MpRxR].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Long-term therapy**: Continuous to maintain LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction [^115BT9ob] [^115Qxm5F].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess lipids at 4–6 weeks [^11294Mp8] after initiation or dose change, then periodically [^111WoJZk].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop if persistent ALT ≥ 3× ULN or myopathy occurs [^1144DR3w].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose and duration

Clinical evidence supporting dose and duration includes the **IMPROVE-IT trial**, where ezetimibe 10 mg daily plus simvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL-C and cardiovascular events over six years [^115BT9ob]. A **meta-analysis** also showed that ezetimibe 10 mg daily lowers LDL-C by ~18–25% and is well tolerated [^112LxuBB].

---

## Special populations

In special populations, **elderly** patients [^114Znikq] may have higher plasma concentrations, but no dose adjustment is required [^113MpRxR]. In **pediatrics**, use is appropriate in children ≥ 10 years [^11294Mp8] with HeFH, with limited data in younger children [^11328Fhe].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: Myalgia, elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal symptoms [^1168sdR1] [^116nqbfZ].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [^1119GRZR], hepatotoxicity [^1144DR3w].
- **Monitoring**: Periodic liver enzymes and CK if symptoms suggest myopathy [^1144DR3w].

---

Ezetimibe is given at **10 mg once daily** [^1133w5rS] for all indications [^113vapEn], with no adjustment for renal impairment [^113qkMvn] or mild hepatic impairment [^11668nxA]; therapy is **long-term** [^113bUEqX] with lipid reassessment at 4–6 weeks [^11294Mp8] and periodic monitoring [^111WoJZk], and should be stopped if significant liver enzyme elevations or myopathy occur [^1144DR3w].

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11294Mp8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration information**: Take ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. The maximum recommended dosage is ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/40 mg once daily. The 10 mg/80 mg daily dosage is restricted to adult patients who have been taking this dosage routinely (e.g. for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. For patients requiring high-intensity statin treatment or unable to achieve their LDL-C goal with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/40 mg daily, alternative LDL-C-lowering treatments should be prescribed. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible, but do not double the next dose. Assess LDL-C levels when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 weeks after initiating ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, and adjust the dosage if necessary.
- **Recommended dosage in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH**

- **Recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment**: Renal impairment is a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy. Doses exceeding 10 mg/20 mg should be used with caution and closely monitored in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

There are no dosage adjustment recommendations for patients with mild renal impairment.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^115BT9ob]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The IMPROVE-IT study, published by Cannon CP and colleagues in 2015 in the journal "The New England Journal of Medicine", addresses several diseases: dyslipidemia, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. The trial's primary question was the effect of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome.

The study employed a multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, enrolling a population of 18,144 patients (4,416 female, 13,728 male). Inclusion criteria consisted of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days with LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg/dL. Key exclusion criteria included planned CABG for the acute coronary syndrome event and a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 40 mg of simvastatin.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Simvastatin-ezetimibe group (n = 9,067)**: Simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg, once daily.
	- **Simvastatin monotherapy group (n = 9,077)**: Simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus placebo, once daily.
- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary events, or nonfatal stroke. The Kaplan-Meier event rate at 7 years was 32.7% versus 34.7% (HR 0.936, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99).

Secondary outcomes included a significant increase in the median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol levels.

### Efficacy and safety of statins, ezetimibe and statins-ezetimibe therapies for children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: Systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^11328Fhe]. Atherosclerosis (2025). High credibility.

- **Synthesis**: When at least two studies reported a specified outcome, effect estimates were pooled using standard random and fixed effects meta-analyses, with results presented in forest plots. Continuous outcomes, specifically the percentage and absolute reduction from baseline in cholesterol, were analyzed in terms of mean differences (MDs) between arms. Dichotomous outcomes, such as adverse events, were analyzed using relative risks. Heterogeneity was assessed through I² and by examining the between-study heterogeneity standard deviation (τ) relative to the treatment effect size.
- **Pairwise meta-analyses**: Separate meta-analyses were conducted for each lipid-lowering medication, including statins only, ezetimibe only, and the combination of statins and ezetimibe. For trials reporting multiple follow-up times for the same treatment and trial arm, the last follow-up value within the blinded period was utilized. In trials using multiple treatment doses, only the highest dose was included, except when analyses were stratified by dosage. The relative effectiveness of different statin types and doses, as well as comparisons between statins and ezetimibe alone and in combination, were explored using standard subgroup analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted in R using the publicly available meta library, and publication bias was assessed using standard methods.
- **Network meta-analyses**: NMA is an extension of pairwise (two-treatment) meta-analysis that enables comparisons across three or more treatments by producing relative effects for every pair of treatments in a connected network. Outcomes data from studies…

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^113bUEqX]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Our study systematically reviewed all ezetimibe trials and cohort studies from the literature and ClinicalTrials.gov and engaged a multidisciplinary panel to contextualize our findings into clinical practice. The GRADE approach, based on the absolute effects, facilitates the application in clinical practice. In trials, we did not identify credible subgroup effects for any of the harm outcomes regarding different follow-up durations. With support from observational studies with a median follow-up duration of up to 7.7 years, our study supports the long-term safety of the drug. Nevertheless, long-term surveillance remains necessary.

The key limitation of this study is that the number of some events (i.e.g.astrointestinal and neurocognitive events) is rare, and therefore findings for these events could be imprecise. Unfortunately, the included observational studies to supplement the trial evidence overall provided very low certainty evidence and were not powered to improve precision for these or other harm outcomes. A large-scale, population-based study could be helpful in the future. However, such rare events might not alter clinical decision-making because of the very low absolute baseline risk. The systematic review did not provide direct evidence for people with characteristics that were not represented by the study population (e.g. low LDL-C concentration before treatment). People who might not be represented should consider this when evaluating the direct evidence.

### Ezetimibe monotherapy for cholesterol lowering in 2,722 people: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LxuBB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the evidence on the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe monotherapy for treating primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia.

- **Design**: The study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Methods**: Researchers examined eleven electronic bibliographic databases covering biomedical, scientific, and grey literature from inception. This was further supplemented by reaching out to experts in the field. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, with a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks, which compared ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg per day) with placebo.

- **Results**: In the absence of data from clinical outcome trials, surrogate endpoints such as changes in lipid concentrations were used as indicators of clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (all 12 weeks in duration) demonstrated that ezetimibe monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL cholesterol (from baseline to endpoint) of -18.58% (95% CI: -19.67 to -17.48, P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. Significant changes (P < 0.00001) were also observed in total cholesterol (-13.46%, 95% CI: -14.22 to -12.70), HDL cholesterol (3.00%, 95% CI: 2.06–3.94), and triglyceride levels (-8.06%, 95% CI: -10.92 to -5.20). Ezetimibe monotherapy appeared to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

- **Conclusions**: In a meta-analysis restricted to short-term trials in hypercholesterolaemia, potentially favorable changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels relative to baseline were observed with ezetimibe monotherapy.

Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets (n = 255) and at an incidence greater than placebo, regardless of causality assessment, from the placebo-controlled trial.
- **Placebo-controlled combination study**: The active ingredients equivalent to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets were co-administered. †All doses.

After completing the 12-week study, eligible patients were assigned to co-administered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets (10/10 to 10/80) or atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg/day) for an additional 48 weeks. The long-term co-administration of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin had an overall safety profile similar to that of atorvastatin alone.

Ezetimibe was evaluated in 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 2396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 9 to 86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 5% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 2% Asians) and elevated LDL-C. These patients were treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range 0 to 39 weeks).

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and at an incidence greater than placebo, regardless of causality assessment, are shown in Table 3.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^114Znikq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Simvastatin**: Following an oral dose of ¹⁴C-labeled simvastatin in humans, 13% of the dose was excreted in urine and 60% in feces. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (simvastatin plus ¹⁴C-metabolites) peaked at 4 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of the peak by 12 hours post-dose.
- **Specific populations**:
	- **Geriatric patients**:
		- **Ezetimibe**: In a multiple-dose trial with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days, plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were about 2-fold higher in older (greater than or equal to 65 years) healthy subjects compared to younger subjects.
		- **Simvastatin**: In a trial including 16 geriatric patients between 70 and 78 years of age who received simvastatin 40 mg/day, the mean plasma level of total inhibitor activity was increased approximately 45% compared to 18 patients between 18 to 30 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
- **Gender**:
	- **Ezetimibe**: In a multiple-dose trial with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days, plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were slightly higher (less than 20%) in females than in males.
- **Race**:
	- **Ezetimibe**: Based on a meta-analysis of multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies, there were no pharmacokinetic differences between Black or African American and White subjects. Studies in Asian subjects indicated that the pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were similar to those seen in White subjects.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11591XXa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 2959 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of six treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg).

The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin, and rosuvastatin on total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, non-HDL-C, and HDL-C are shown in the results.

In another multicenter, double-blind, 24-week trial, 214 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were treated with thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) for a minimum of 3 months and simvastatin 20 mg for a minimum of 6 weeks, were randomized to receive either simvastatin 40 mg or the co-administered active ingredients equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg. The median LDL-C and HbA1c levels at baseline were 89 mg/dL and 7.1%, respectively.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg was significantly more effective than doubling the dose of simvastatin to 40 mg. The median percent changes from baseline for ezetimibe and simvastatin vs. simvastatin were: LDL-C -25% and -5%; total-C -16% and -5%; Apo B -19% and -5%; and non-HDL-C -23% and -5%. Results for HDL-C and TG between the two treatment groups were not significantly different.

### Paradoxical progression of atherosclerosis related to low-density lipoprotein reduction and exposure to ezetimibe [^113yYcxQ]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but has complex actions on cholesterol transport and metabolism; thus, LDL-C reduction may not solely define its overall effects. We explored the relationship between treatment effects and cumulative exposure to ezetimibe and its effects on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in ARBITER 6-HALTS.

This analysis includes the 159 patients randomized to ezetimibe within ARBITER 6-HALTS who completed the final imaging endpoint assessment. Eligibility criteria for ARBITER 6-HALTS included known coronary artery disease (CAD) or high risk for coronary heart disease and treatment with a statin with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 50 or 55 mg/dL for men and women, respectively. The mean CIMT was measured in the far wall of the distal common carotid artery. We analyzed the univariate and multivariate relationships of the change in CIMT with baseline characteristics, on-treatment effects, and cumulative ezetimibe exposure (treatment duration × dose × adherence).

Ezetimibe reduced LDL-C from 84 ± 23 to 66 ± 20 mg/dL. No net effect on CIMT was observed (baseline CIMT 0.898 ± 0.151 mm; net change -0.002 mm; P = 0.52). There was an inverse relationship between LDL-C and change in CIMT, such that greater reductions in LDL-C were associated with greater CIMT progression (r = -0.266; P < 0.001). Change in CIMT also had univariate associations with baseline LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and systolic blood pressure, and was directly associated with these variables.

### Nexlizet [^115LEtUG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe, following a single dose of Nexlizet to fasted adults, reached mean ± SD Cmax values of 3.56 ± 1.90 ng/mL with a median Tmax of 5 hours. Ezetimibe-glucuronide attained mean Cmax values of 107 ± 46 ng/mL with a median Tmax of 1 hour. For ezetimibe monotherapy, there was no substantial deviation from dose proportionality between 5 mg and 20 mg (0.5- to 2-fold the recommended dosage). The absolute bioavailability of ezetimibe cannot be determined, as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection.
- **Effect of food**: After the administration of Nexlizet with a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast in healthy subjects, the AUC for bempedoic acid and ezetimibe was comparable to the fasted state. Compared to the fasted state, the fed state resulted in 30% and 12% reductions in Cmax and 2-hour and 2.5-hour delays in median time to attain maximum concentration (Tmax) of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, respectively. For ezetimibe glucuronide, a 12% and 42% decrease in AUC and Cmax, respectively, were observed under fed relative to fasted conditions. This effect of food is not considered to be clinically meaningful.
- **Distribution**: The bempedoic acid apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 18 L. Plasma protein binding of bempedoic acid, its glucuronide, and its active metabolite, ESP15228, were 99.3%, 98.8%, and 99.2%, respectively. Bempedoic acid does not partition into blood cells. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are highly bound (> 90%) to human plasma proteins.

### Nexlizet [^113TEVL4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe was studied in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, known coronary heart disease, or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial, 769 patients (ages 22 to 85 years; 42% female; 90% White, 6% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 3% other races; 2% Hispanic or Latino) who were already on statin monotherapy but had not met their NCEP ATP II target LDL-C goal, were randomized to receive either ezetimibe or placebo in addition to their ongoing statin therapy.

Ezetimibe, when added to ongoing statin therapy, significantly lowered total cholesterol (TC) by 17%, LDL-C by 25%, apo B by 19%, and non-HDL-C by 23% compared to baseline and to a statin administered alone. LDL-C reductions from ezetimibe were generally consistent across all statins.

In four multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, 2,382 patients (ages 18 to 87 years; 57% female; 88% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 5% other races, mostly of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with hyperlipidemia received ezetimibe or placebo alone or with various doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or lovastatin. When compared to those receiving the corresponding statin alone, patients receiving ezetimibe with a statin showed significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (ezetimibe + all atorvastatin doses [-56%] versus atorvastatin alone).

### Treatment of high-risk patients with ezetimibe plus simvastatin co-administration versus simvastatin alone to attain National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals [^113i7wYW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study assessed whether the co-administration of ezetimibe and simvastatin would be more effective than simvastatin monotherapy in allowing high-risk patients to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of less than 100 mg/dl compared to simvastatin alone. Patients with LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dl or more and meeting National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent were randomized to one of four daily treatments for 23 weeks: simvastatin 20 mg (n = 253), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg (n = 251), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg (n = 109), and ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 40 mg (n = 97).

- **Titration protocol**: In all groups, patients not at goal had their simvastatin doses doubled at weeks 6, 12, and/or 18, up to a maximum of 80 mg. The primary efficacy objective was LDL cholesterol goal attainment (< 100 mg/dl) after 5 weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Ezetimibe plus any dose of simvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL cholesterol and allowed more patients to achieve goal after 5 weeks (p < 0.001) and at the end of the study (p < 0.001) than simvastatin 20 mg alone. At 5 weeks, 75%, 83%, and 87% of patients receiving ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg had LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl compared with 46% of patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg. In patients who started on ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, 33%, 22%, and 12%, respectively, required simvastatin titration during the study compared with 68% of patients who started on simvastatin 20 mg. The corresponding median simvastatin doses used were 10, 20, 40, and 40 mg.

### Achieving goal lipid levels with ezetimibe plus statin add-on or switch therapy compared with doubling the statin dose. A pooled analysis [^112Zg9B7]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluate the lipid-altering effects of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy, statin titration, and switching from statin monotherapy to a more potent statin or to ezetimibe/simvastatin. A pooled analysis was conducted using patient-level data from 17 double-blind, active or placebo-controlled studies. These studies included 8,667 hypercholesterolemic adults randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg added to ongoing statins, statin titration (doubling), or switching from ongoing statins to rosuvastatin (10 mg) or to ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 and 40 mg). Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated by analysis of variance. The percent of patients who achieved LDL-C and other guideline-recommended targets, as well as target lipid levels by baseline distance to goal, were evaluated.

LDL-C percent change from baseline was -26.0% for ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy, -27.6% for switching from ongoing statin to ezetimibe/simvastatin, -19.7% for switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg, and -9.7% for dose doubling of the ongoing statin. For patients within 0.8 mmol/L (30 mg/dL) of the target at baseline, LDL-C target attainment rates were 75.9% for adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin, 72.8% for switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin, 61.8% for switching to rosuvastatin, and 44.3% for statin dose doubling. Similarly, improvements in other lipids and achievement of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B targets among this patient group were largest for ezetimibe added to ongoing statins and switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin.

### Lypqozet [^1148RZo5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets (10/20) were significantly more effective than doubling the dose of atorvastatin to 40 mg in further reducing total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C. Results for HDL-C and TG between the two treatment groups were not significantly different. In addition, significantly more patients receiving ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets 10/20 attained LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) compared to those receiving atorvastatin 40 mg; 84% vs. 49%.
- **For triglycerides, median % change from baseline**:

	- †Patients on atorvastatin 20 mg, then switched to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets 10/20 or titrated to atorvastatin 40 mg
	- **‡Baseline units**: mg/dL; medians for TG, means for all other values
	- §p < 0.05 for difference with atorvastatin

The Ezetimibe Plus Atorvastatin Versus Atorvastatin Titration in Achieving Lower LDL-C Targets in Hypercholesterolemic Patients (EZ-PATH) study, a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, 6-week study, included 556 patients with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL and ≤ 160 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L and ≤ 4.1 mmol/L) and at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). All patients received atorvastatin 40 mg for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients not at the optional NCEP ATP III LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) were randomized to receive either coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin (equivalent to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets 10/40) or atorvastatin 80 mg for 6 weeks.

### Ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality events [^116kCpeb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. High levels of blood cholesterol are considered major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for CVD prevention. However, some individuals at high risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended statin doses. Ezetimibe, a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, is of interest for its potential effects on CVD events, although these effects remain uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent, and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for CVD prevention and mortality is necessary.
- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
- **Search methods**: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched on June 27, 2018, along with two clinical trial registry platforms on July 11, 2018. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and had a follow-up period of at least 12 months.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. Statistical analyses were performed.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe with or without statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UCpzm]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

To compare the impact of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in adults taking maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are statin intolerant, a network meta-analysis was conducted.

Data sources included Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies involved randomized controlled trials of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors with ≥ 500 patients and follow-up of ≥ 6 months.
- **Main outcome measures**: We performed frequentist fixed-effects network meta-analysis and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess the certainty of evidence. Results included relative risks (RR) and absolute risks per 1000 patients treated for five years for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. We estimated absolute risk differences assuming constant RR (estimated from network meta-analysis) across different baseline therapies and cardiovascular risk thresholds; the PREDICT risk calculator estimated cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. Patients were categorized at low to very high cardiovascular risk. A guideline panel and systematic review authors established the minimal important differences (MID) of 12 per 1000 for MI and 10 per 1000 for stroke.

Results identified 14 trials assessing ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors among 83,660 adults using statins. Adding ezetimibe to statins reduced MI (RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94)) and stroke (RR 0.82 (0.71)).

### Comparison of effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin versus atorvastatin in reducing C-reactive protein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^115LDB9g]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The lowering effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared with those of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy in a large cohort of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with simvastatin, data were combined from three identical, prospective 12-week trials in which patients were randomized to receive placebo; ezetimibe 10 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg added to simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with atorvastatin, data were analyzed from a phase III, double-blind, active-controlled study in which patients were randomized equally to receive ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks.

When averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin produced significantly greater reductions compared with simvastatin alone in LDL cholesterol (52.5% vs. 38.0%, respectively) and CRP levels (31.0% vs. 14.3%, respectively). At each individual simvastatin dose, co-administration with ezetimibe produced significant further CRP reductions versus simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe/simvastatin was significantly more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol than atorvastatin when pooled across doses (53.4% vs. 45.3%, respectively) and in each milligram-equivalent dose comparison. Reductions in CRP of similar magnitude were observed with ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin when averaged across doses and at each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^115vgP2R]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Data were collected in a predefined collection form incorporating study characteristics (e.g. first author name, year of publication, study design, sample size, follow-up duration, prevention type, the intervention of control, and background treatment); baseline characteristics (e.g. age, sex, body mass index, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides); intervention characteristics (e.g. drug dose, treatment duration); and safety outcomes (e.g. number of events and patients of each outcome) for randomised controlled trials. If a published trial did not report the outcome information while the corresponding ClinicalTrials.gov reported relevant data, we collected data from the registry report. When the data in publication and ClinicalTrials.gov conflicted, we used the data from the publication.

For observational studies, additional data were collected, including prospective or retrospective design, exposure, data source, and methods for comparability (that is, matching or adjusting for confounding variables). Adjusted effect estimates (that is, relative risks or odds ratios) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were preferred to raw data of adverse events in observational studies. Paired reviewers (YW and HD) performed the data extraction, and a third reviewer (SL) judged the discrepancies, if any.

Paired reviewers (YW and HD) assessed the risk of bias for randomised controlled trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment tool and that for observational studies with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.

### Lovastatin [^114vSyit]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving lovastatin tablets USP, and should continue on this diet during treatment with lovastatin tablets USP [see NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary therapy]. Lovastatin tablets USP should be given with meals.

- **Adult patients**: The usual recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day, given with the evening meal. The recommended dosing range of lovastatin is 10 to 80 mg per day in single or two divided doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see NCEP Guidelines and Clinical Pharmacology]. Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal [see Indications and Usage] should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin tablets. A starting dose of 10 mg of lovastatin may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. Cholesterol levels should be monitored periodically, and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of lovastatin tablets if cholesterol levels fall significantly below the targeted range.

- **Dosage in patients taking danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil**: In patients taking danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil concomitantly with lovastatin, therapy should begin with 10 mg of lovastatin and should not exceed 20 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, Warnings, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis, Precautions, Drug Interactions, Other Drug Interactions].

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^115YUCXA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Simvastatin: Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profiles of both active and total inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase were not affected when simvastatin was administered immediately before an American Heart Association recommended low-fat meal.
- **Distribution**:
	- **Ezetimibe**: Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are highly bound (greater than 90%) to human plasma proteins.
	- **Simvastatin**: Both simvastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (approximately 95%) to human plasma proteins. When radiolabeled simvastatin was administered to rats, simvastatin-derived radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier.

- **Elimination and Metabolism**:
	- **Ezetimibe**: Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation, with subsequent biliary and renal excretion. Minimal oxidative metabolism has been observed in all species evaluated. In humans, ezetimibe is rapidly metabolized to ezetimibe-glucuronide. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are the major drug-derived compounds detected in plasma, constituting approximately 10 to 20% and 80 to 90% of the total drug in plasma, respectively. Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are eliminated from plasma with a half-life of approximately 22 hours for both compounds. Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibit multiple peaks, suggesting enterohepatic recycling.

### Inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein alone or with ezetimibe in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia [^115RVTsF]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients with coronary heart disease do not achieve recommended LDL-cholesterol levels due to either intolerance or inadequate response to available lipid-lowering therapy. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors might provide an alternative way to lower LDL-cholesterol levels. We tested the safety and LDL-cholesterol-lowering efficacy of an MTP inhibitor, AEGR-733 (Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bridgewater, NJ), alone and in combination with ezetimibe.
- **Methods**: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, 12-week trial, which included 84 patients with hypercholesterolemia. Patients were randomly assigned ezetimibe 10 mg daily (n = 29); AEGR-733 5.0 mg daily for the first 4 weeks, 7.5 mg daily for the second 4 weeks, and 10 mg daily for the last 4 weeks (n = 28); or ezetimibe 10 mg daily and AEGR-733 administered with the dose titration described above (n = 28).
- **Results**: Ezetimibe monotherapy led to a 20–22% decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations. AEGR-733 monotherapy led to a dose-dependent decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration: 19% at 5.0 mg, 26% at 7.5 mg, and 30% at 10 mg. Combined therapy produced similar but larger dose-dependent decreases (35%, 38%, and 46%, respectively). The number of patients who discontinued study drugs owing to adverse events was five with ezetimibe alone, nine with AEGR-733 alone, and four with combined ezetimibe and AEGR-733. Discontinuations from AEGR-733 were due primarily to mild transaminase elevations.
- **Conclusions**: Inhibition of LDL production with low-dose AEGR-733, either alone or in combination, shows promise for lowering cholesterol levels in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. However, there is a need to manage adverse effects to improve overall tolerance.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab versus ezetimibe over 2 years (from ODYSSEY COMBO II) [^1176UYJA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, alirocumab, has been shown to substantially reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Demonstrating whether efficacy and safety are maintained over a long duration of exposure is vital for clinical decision-making. The COMBO II trial compared the efficacy and safety of alirocumab versus ezetimibe over 2 years. A prespecified first analysis was reported at 52 weeks. Here, we report the final end-of-study data (on-treatment) and evaluate post hoc the safety profile with longer versus shorter duration of alirocumab exposure.

Patients (n = 720) on maximally tolerated statin dose were treated with alirocumab (75/150 mg every 2 weeks) or ezetimibe (10 mg/day). Overall mean adherence for both treatment groups during the first and second year was > 97%. At 2 years, LDL-C was reduced by 49% (alirocumab) versus 17% (ezetimibe; p < 0.0001), and LDL-C < 70 mg/dl was achieved by 73% of alirocumab-treated versus 40% of ezetimibe-treated patients. Overall safety was similar in both treatment groups at 2 years and during the first versus the second year.

Local injection-site reactions were reported by 2.5% (alirocumab) versus 0.8% (ezetimibe) during the first year, and 0.2% versus 0.5% during the second year, indicating early occurrence during prolonged alirocumab exposure. Two consecutive calculated LDL-C values < 25 mg/dl were observed in 28% of alirocumab-treated patients (vs 0.4% with ezetimibe). Persistent anti-drug antibody responses were observed in 1.3% (6 of 454) of alirocumab-treated versus 0.4% (1 of 231) of ezetimibe-treated patients.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targeting with pitavastatin + ezetimibe for patients with acute coronary syndrome and dyslipidaemia: the HIJ-PROPER study, a prospective, open-label, randomized trial [^114Sroos]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

As noted previously, even in the era of intensive statin therapy, ACS patients with dyslipidaemia may not reach their targeted LDL-C or obtain improved clinical outcomes. These challenges are now being considered in a number of clinical trials. While no data are yet available on cardiovascular outcomes, it seems feasible that statins in combination with non-statin drugs might provide greater lipid lowering and thus prove more effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events than statins alone, particularly in high-risk populations. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prospective clinical trials have yet evaluated the effects of LDL-C targeting therapy on subsequent cardiovascular outcomes in ACS patients.

To explore this question, we needed a drug regimen that would reliably reduce LDL-C to the aggressive target level of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). We decided to combine a statin with ezetimibe, an intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor that selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption by blocking the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 receptor. Two recent studies that demonstrated the benefits of a combination of statin plus ezetimibe in patients with CAD support our choice of ezetimibe.

We hypothesized that we could achieve intensive LDL-C lowering by administering ezetimibe in conjunction with a standard dose of statin, and that this treatment would be more beneficial for secondary prevention than statin monotherapy in ACS patients with dyslipidaemia.

The Heart Institute of Japan, Department of Cardiology (HIJC) Investigators' project is an ongoing collaboration.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115EAQgm]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Lowering LDL-C improves clinical outcomes, and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL-C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years.

Although the initial lowering of LDL-C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin-induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL-C concentration.

In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new-onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high-dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low-dose group (0.03%).

Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin group (3.0% vs. 2.4%).

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aXyE8]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The search strategy yielded a total of 3060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening, 32 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Inter-reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

The included articles consisted of 12,042 ASCVD patients, among which 5880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe. In contrast, 6162 participants received high-intensity statin monotherapy. The studies employed various statins: rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), whereas blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline.

Twenty-one studies compared high-intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL-C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy showed a greater reduction in LDL-C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5). However, there was a high degree of heterogeneity among the included studies (I² = 84%, p < 0.01).

### Comparative effects on lipid levels of combination therapy with a statin and extended-release niacin or ezetimibe versus a statin alone (the COMPELL study) [^113B8JBX]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend lower target cholesterol levels and treatment of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglycerides for patients at moderately high to high coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Combination therapy is often required to achieve multiple lipid treatment goals, with a reduction of 50% or more in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) needed in some patients to meet aggressive LDL-C targets.

In this context, we evaluated the comparative effects on lipid levels of combination therapy at low to moderate doses with a statin plus extended-release niacin (niacin ER), a statin plus ezetimibe, and a highly potent statin alone. This was an open-label, multicenter, 12-week study in 292 patients (50% women) who qualified for drug therapy based on the number of CHD risk factors. Patients were randomized to four parallel arms, titrated from low to moderate or high doses: atorvastatin/niacin ER, rosuvastatin/niacin ER, simvastatin/ezetimibe, or rosuvastatin alone.

Baseline mean values were: LDL-C 197 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L), HDL-C 49 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L), and triglycerides 168 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L). There were no significant differences among treatment groups in the change from baseline in LDL-C at pre-specified time points during treatment. All groups lowered LDL-C by approximately 50% or more (range -49 to -57%), achieving mean levels of 82–98 mg/dL (2.1–2.5 mmol/L). Changes in non-HDL-C (range -46 to -55%) mirrored those for LDL-C and did not differ among treatment groups. Statin/niacin ER combination regimens also increased HDL-C and large HDL.

### Evidence for statin pleiotropy in humans: Differential effects of statins and ezetimibe on Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase activity, endothelial function, and inflammation [^116GMJGx]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

By inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, statins not only reduce cholesterol biosynthesis but also decrease the formation of isoprenoids, which are important for mediating signaling through the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. Increased ROCK activity has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. We hypothesize that ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, may not exert similar cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects as statins and, when used with a lower dose of statin, may have less effect on ROCK activity than a higher dose of statin.

- **Methods and results**: In a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study, we treated 60 dyslipidemic subjects without cardiovascular disease with simvastatin 40 mg/d, simvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg/d, or placebo tablets for 28 days (n = 20 in each arm). We evaluated baseline demographics and lipid levels, ROCK activity, C-reactive protein, and flow-mediated dilation before and after treatment. Compared with the placebo group, both treatment regimens decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 38% and C-reactive protein by 38% to 40% after 28 days (P < 0.01 for both compared with placebo). Although the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein reductions were comparable with either lipid-lowering regimen, only simvastatin 40 mg reduced ROCK activity and improved flow-mediated dilation (P < 0.01 for both compared with baseline). The reduction in ROCK activity with simvastatin 40 mg remained significant even aft

### Variability of the LDL-C lowering response to ezetimibe and ezetimibe + statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients [^113n1cCd]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

We compared the variability of LDL-C-lowering responses to treatment with ezetimibe + statins versus statins in hypercholesterolemic patients.
- **Methods**: An analysis of patient-level data was conducted by pooling information from 27 double-blind, placebo and/or active-controlled studies. This involved 21,671 patients treated with ezetimibe + statins versus statins on first-line (statin-naïve/wash-out) or second-line therapies (either on statin, randomized to ezetimibe versus placebo [add-on] or ezetimibe versus uptitrated statin [uptitrate]) for 6–24 weeks. Variances such as standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and root mean squared error (RMSE) adjusted for various factors were used to compare percentage change from baseline in LDL-C.
- **Results**: In first-line and second-line add-on studies, the variability (SD, RMSE) of percentage change from baseline in LDL-C was lower in patients treated with ezetimibe + statins compared to those treated with only statins, even after adjusting for covariates. Although the differences were small, they were statistically significant due to the large sample size. In second-line uptitrate studies, while the unadjusted variability (SD) was greater for ezetimibe + statin treatment compared to statin therapy, the adjusted variability (RMSE) was significantly lower. The relative variability (CV, defined as SD/mean) was consistently lower for ezetimibe + statins compared to statin therapy across all study types. This effect was more pronounced in second-line add-on and uptitrate studies, attributed to larger mean LDL-C reductions for the ezetimibe + statins groups compared to the statin groups. When assessed by individual study/type, statin brand, potency, or dose, the CVs remained lower for ezetimibe + statins compared to statins in second-li.

### Efficacy and safety of coadministration of rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, and colestimide in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^116xnjKZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aggressive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering therapy is important for high-risk patients. However, sparse data exist on the impact of combined aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), particularly on side effects related to changes in plasma coenzyme Q10 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels. We enrolled 17 Japanese patients with heterozygous FH (12 men, 63.9 ± 7.4 years old) with single LDL receptor gene mutations in a prospective open randomized study. Permitted maximum doses of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), ezetimibe (10 mg/day), and granulated colestimide (3.62 g/day) were introduced sequentially. Serum levels of LDL cholesterol decreased significantly by -66.4% (p < 0.001) and 44% of participants achieved LDL cholesterol levels < 100 mg/dl. There were no serious side effects or abnormal laboratory data that would have required the protocol to be terminated, except for 1 patient with myalgia. Coadministration of ezetimibe and granulated colestimide further lowered serum LDL cholesterol more than rosuvastatin alone without changing plasma coenzyme Q10 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels. In conclusion, adequate introduction of this aggressive cholesterol-lowering regimen can improve the lipid profile of FH.

### Effect on serum lipid levels of switching dose of ezetimibe from 10 to 5 mg [^116xeZTL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although during its initial development, lower doses of ezetimibe reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) significantly, ezetimibe is available only in a 10-mg form. Compliant patients receiving ezetimibe 10 mg were randomized in a blinded fashion to either continue therapy with ezetimibe 10 mg or convert to a split-tablet 5-mg dose. Lipid panels were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy. The impact of the two ezetimibe dosing strategies on LDL and the achievement of the Adult Treatment Panel III LDL goal was evaluated.

One hundred thirty patients receiving ezetimibe 10 mg were screened for eligibility. Thirty-nine of the 130 patients were randomized; 36 patients successfully completed the study. All patients who had achieved their Adult Treatment Panel III LDL goals at baseline remained at their LDL goals after conversion to 5 mg. In conclusion, conversion to the lower dose of ezetimibe did not result in any clinically meaningful or statistically significant changes in any lipid parameter.

### Statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events [^114Wj6SJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the physiologically normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the thresholds for the development of atherosclerosis and adverse coronary events, are in the 30- to 70-mg/dl range. More patients have been studied in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of statins on outcomes than any other drug class in the history of medicine.

This cumulative body of evidence documents that atherosclerosis progression is halted and coronary heart disease events are minimized when statin therapy, with or without ezetimibe, and possibly proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, is used to drive down the LDL-C to a range of about 30 to 50 mg/dl.

Thus far, these agents appear to be safe even when LDL-C is lowered to about 50 mg/dl, although more robust outcome and safety data are required, particularly for the PCSK9 inhibitors and very low LDL-C levels (e.g. down to 25 mg/dl). In conclusion, the national guidelines specifying only the use of a high-potency statin without specific LDL-C goals may lead to substantial undertreatment of high-risk patients, leaving them vulnerable to future adverse cardiovascular events.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^117DB7BU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two composite endpoints were defined to have enough events to assess relative risk reductions across a range of baseline characteristics:

- **Major coronary events (MCE)**: Comprised of CHD mortality and non-fatal MI. Analyzed by time-to-first event; 898 patients (8.7%) treated with simvastatin had events and 1,212 patients (11.8%) treated with placebo had events.
- **Major vascular events (MVE)**: Comprised of MCE, stroke, and revascularization procedures including coronary, peripheral, and other non-coronary procedures. Analyzed by time-to-first event; 2,033 patients (19.8%) treated with simvastatin had events and 2,585 patients (25.2%) on placebo had events.

Simvastatin use led to significant relative risk reductions for both composite endpoints (27% for MCE and 24% for MVE, p < 0.0001) and for all components of the composite endpoints. The risk reductions produced by simvastatin in both MCE and MVE were evident and consistent regardless of cardiovascular disease-related medical history at trial entry (i.e. CHD alone; or peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or treated hypertension, with or without CHD), gender, age, baseline levels of LDL-C, baseline concomitant cardiovascular medications (i.e. aspirin, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers), smoking status, or obesity. Patients with diabetes showed risk reductions for MCE and MVE due to simvastatin treatment regardless of baseline HbA1c levels or obesity.

### Short-term ezetimibe is well tolerated and effective in combination with statin therapy to treat elevated LDL cholesterol in HIV-infected patients [^117FDgGZ]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol.
- **Methods**: Multicentered double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study to determine the short-term safety, efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe in combination with ongoing statin therapy in HIV-infected adults with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Participants on stable HAART with fasting LDL-C of at least 130 mg/dl and stable statin were randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of washout and then 12 weeks with an alternative study assignment. Percentage and absolute change in LDL-C (primary endpoint), total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were compared. Changes in clinical symptoms and safety laboratory measurements were assessed.
- **Results**: Forty-four participants enrolled: 70% men, median age 49 years, 43% White/Non-Hispanic, median CD4 cell count 547 cells/microl, and 95% HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml. Median (interquartile range) percentage change in LDL-C was -20.8% (-25.4, -10.7) with ezetimibe and -0.7% (-10.3, 18.6) with placebo. The median within-participant effect of ezetimibe was -14.1% (-33.0, -5.0; P < 0.0001). The median difference in absolute LDL-C values between ezetimibe and placebo was -32 mg/dl (-58, -6; P < 0.0001). Significant differences in the within-participant effect of ezetimibe were noted for total cholesterol, -18.60% (-27.22, -11.67; P < 0.001), non-HDL-C, -23.18% (-33.14, -14.36; P < 0.0001), and apolipoprotein B, -8.7.

### Ezetimibe + simvastatin versus doubling the dose of simvastatin in high cardiovascular risk diabetics: A multicenter, randomized trial (the LEAD study) [^113S2fDJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

In the present study, both treatment regimens had similar safety and tolerability profiles during the study period. Despite higher baseline laboratory values in the simvastatin group, there were no reports of increased ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN nor CK ≥ 5 × ULN in this treatment group during the study, nor were there reports of increases in ALT, AST, or CK in the EZ + simva 10/20 mg group. Accordingly, neither the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin 20 mg nor doubling the dose of simvastatin to 40 mg resulted in reports of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. These results are consistent with expectations for these drugs at the doses given and with previous trials in this patient population. Although the incidence of serious adverse events was low, this study was relatively small and not powered nor of sufficient duration to assess the prevalence of rare adverse events.

### Synergistic effect of simvastatin and ezetimibe on lipid and pro-inflammatory profiles in pre-diabetic subjects [^111whU6C]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is a specific cholesterol absorption inhibitor that acts at the brush border of the small intestine, blocking the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol and plant sterols, resulting in intracellular cholesterol depletion via the Niemann-Pick C1-like transporter. Adding ezetimibe to statin therapy induces a 15% reduction in LDL levels compared with only 6% achieved by doubling the dose of statins. Data concerning the pleiotropic effects of this combination are controversial. One study, in which CRP level was used as the inflammatory marker, found that a combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe produced an incremental effect in lowering CRP, independently of the improvement in lipoprotein concentrations. Although few studies have confirmed this finding, as far as we know, data regarding simvastatin-ezetimibe combination induced-changes in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels are lacking. We tested the hypothesis that this combination would induce improvement in inflammatory status, as reflected by leukocyte count and CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α levels.

Therefore, this study evaluates whether the combination of lipid-lowering effects of low-to-moderate dose of simvastatin and ezetimibe also results in a synergistic effect that reduces the pro-inflammatory status of pre-diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia.

### Inverse relationship between LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 plasma levels in dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys: effects of LDL lowering by ezetimibe in the absence of statins [^112MbdZz]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the lipid-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe in dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys, two dosing methods were compared, and PCSK9 plasma levels were evaluated during dyslipidemia induction. This was achieved by feeding a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD), administering ezetimibe (Zetia®, Ezetrol®) treatment, conducting an ezetimibe washout, and an HFD washout.

- **Methods and results**: Twenty dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys were placed on an HFD for seven months, resulting in LDL cholesterol levels of 100–400 mg/dL. The monkeys were randomized into two groups and treated with ezetimibe for two weeks, either by oral gavage or using food treats. The lipid-lowering effects of ezetimibe were identical between the two groups. After treatment, mean LDL cholesterol decreased by 58% (from 174 to 72 mg/dL), total cholesterol by 42% (from 241 to 138 mg/dL), while PCSK9 levels increased by 137% (from 147 to 314 ng/mL). PCSK9 levels on a regular diet before and after HFD were also inversely correlated with LDL cholesterol.

- **Conclusions**: In a cynomolgus dyslipidemia model, PCSK9 levels are inversely correlated with LDL cholesterol in the absence of statin treatment, regardless of whether lipid changes are modulated by diet or ezetimibe treatment.

### Factors associated with enhanced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with bempedoic acid [^115qQLiE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy to assist patients in reaching LDL‐C treatment goals. Variability of LDL‐C lowering with ezetimibe, either alone or in combination with statins, is reported, with some indication that variability with a statin is lower with concomitant ezetimibe use. Furthermore, greater reductions in LDL‐C with ezetimibe when given in combination with a statin are reported among obese individuals. Patients already receiving ezetimibe were more likely to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL‐C when bempedoic acid was added to their regimen. Adherence to treatment tends to decrease with an increase in the number of medications. The fixed‐dose combination of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe may be particularly useful in optimizing patient LDL‐C lowering, especially among patients taking other medications for comorbidities.

Results from multivariable analysis suggest that enhanced (≥ 30%) LDL‐C lowering with bempedoic acid is more likely for women versus men, patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, and patients with higher versus lower hsCRP levels. After middle age, women have a higher total atherogenic lipoprotein burden compared with men, are more likely than men to experience statin intolerance, and less likely than men to be treated with any statin or guideline‐recommended statin intensity. Dyslipidemia is often uncontrolled in patients with diabetes, and patients with diabetes are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event. Patients with higher hsCRP levels are also at a higher risk of having a cardiovascular event.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy for treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^11764zMU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). High credibility.

Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for ≥ 6 weeks were randomized to receive treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks.

The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to endpoint after intervention. Secondary variables included high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p < 0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p < 0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy. Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached the goal at endpoint (odds ratio 23.7; p < 0.001). The co-administration of statin and ezetimibe resulted in superior outcomes.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: A clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms, and potential treatment burdens.
- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high…

### Lipid-altering efficacy of ezetimibe plus statin and statin monotherapy and identification of factors associated with treatment response: a pooled analysis of over 21,000 subjects from 27 clinical trials [^114XdPkY]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with dyslipoproteinemia constitute the largest risk group for the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite extensive statin use, many patients at risk of CVD do not achieve guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets. This pooled analysis of 27 previously published clinical trials, conducted between 1999 and 2008, evaluates the lipid-altering efficacy and factors related to treatment response of ezetimibe combined with statin and statin monotherapy.

Patient-level data were combined from double-blind, placebo-controlled, or active comparator studies randomizing adult subjects to ezetimibe 10 mg plus statin (n = 11,714) versus statin alone (n = 10,517) for 6–24 weeks (mean = 9 weeks). The association of factors with treatment response, percent change from baseline LDL-C and other lipids, and attainment of guideline-recommended lipid and lipoprotein targets were evaluated.

Higher baseline LDL-C, diabetes mellitus, Black race, greater age, and male gender were associated with small but significantly greater percent reductions in LDL-C regardless of treatment. Treatment influenced efficacy, with ezetimibe plus statin producing significantly greater reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, ApoB, triglycerides, lipid ratios, and hs-CRP. There were significantly larger increases in HDL-C and ApoA1, and higher achievement of LDL-C (< 70 mg/dl, < 100 mg/dl), non-HDL-C (< 100 mg/dl, < 130 mg/dl), and ApoB (< 80 mg/dl, < 90 mg/dl) targets than statin monotherapy at statin potencies compared (p < 0.0001 for all).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116y3Pr8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 1,902 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or atorvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg).

Across the dosage range, when patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin were compared to those receiving milligram-equivalent statin doses of atorvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin. Only the 10 mg/40 mg and 10 mg/80 mg ezetimibe and simvastatin doses increased HDL-C significantly more than the corresponding milligram-equivalent statin dose of atorvastatin. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin on TG were similar to the effects seen with atorvastatin.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24-week, forced-titration trial, 788 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to receive coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg and 10 mg/20 mg) or atorvastatin 10 mg. For all three treatment groups, the dose of the statin was titrated at 6-week intervals to 80 mg. At each pre-specified dose comparison, ezetimibe and simvastatin lowered LDL-C to a greater degree than atorvastatin.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KYHYj]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The difference between the effect of high‐intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on HDL‐C, TG, TC, and hs‐CRP was evaluated in 18, 16, 17, and 14 studies, respectively. All analyses demonstrated no significant difference in terms of HDL‐C (MD = 3.1, 95% CI: −1.5 to 7.7), TG (MD = −4.7, 95% CI: −16.5 to 6.1), TC (MD = −0.6, 95% CI: −13.1 to 11.9), and hs‐CRP (MD = 0, 95% CI: −0.0 to 0.0) levels between the treatment arms.

Considerable heterogeneity was noted among the studies, with I² values of 99% (p = 0) for HDL‐C, 78% (p < 0.01) for TG, 99% (p < 0.01) for TC, and 31% (p = 0.13) for hs‐CRP (Figure 2B–E). Although no significant publication bias was observed for HDL‐C, TG, and hs‐CRP, the inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test demonstrated the existence of publication bias for TC (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1B–E).

Subgroup analyses based on the statin class (Supporting Information S1: Figures 3B, 4B, 5B, and 6B) and treatment duration (Supporting Information S1: Figures 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A) did not reveal any significant differences between the efficacy of the two treatment arms. Among the studies analyzing HDL‐C subgroups, heterogeneity was attributed to the atorvastatin subgroup. In the case of TC, heterogeneity was influenced by studies involving multiple statins and atorvastatin.

### Effectiveness of thrice weekly ezetimibe [^114v3HJC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is usually dosed daily, but its 22-hour elimination half-life permits significant cholesterol reduction with less frequent dosing. The aim of this study was to examine lipid changes in 33 patients treated with thrice-weekly ezetimibe for one month or more, who had pre- and post-ezetimibe lipid levels with no other changes in their lipid treatment. Ninety-four percent of the patients were treated with ezetimibe because they experienced myalgias, elevated transaminase levels, or gastrointestinal intolerance with higher doses of other lipid-lowering agents. Total cholesterol decreased by 15% (-36 ± 28 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 20% (-30 ± 25 mg/dl, p < 0.001) during 58 ± 50 days of treatment. Most patients (85%) tolerated the treatment, and many (48%) achieved their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. In conclusion, thrice-weekly ezetimibe decreases total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and is well tolerated. It is a viable treatment for patients intolerant of other lipid-lowering medications.
