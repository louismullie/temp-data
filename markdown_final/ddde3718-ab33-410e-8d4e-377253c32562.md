## Question

evaluation of hormones post menopause for decreased libido

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating hormones in postmenopausal women with decreased libido and determining when, how, and whether to test and treat, especially with testosterone therapy and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational biopsychosocial assessment and confirmation of distress, because diagnosis of HSDD hinges on these. Then, I should verify the role of the physical examination and evaluation for GSM and other reversible contributors. Next, I need to check the divergent guidance on whether to measure androgens at baseline and, if so, how to do it accurately. After that, I will examine how to interpret results given there is no diagnostic cutoff. Then, I should determine clear indications for testosterone therapy and exclusions. Subsequently, I will review the monitoring strategy, targets, adverse effects, and safety uncertainties. Finally, I will consider first-line non-androgen options and synthesize a practical stepwise algorithm with self-checks and timelines for response and discontinuation, ensuring the plan aligns with high-credibility guidelines and trial evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: decreased libido in postmenopausal women is multifactorial, and diagnosis of HSDD requires both low desire and clinically significant personal distress, which means I need to explicitly elicit distress, contextual factors, and comorbidities rather than jump straight to hormone labs. I should double-check medication contributors such as SSRIs and oral estrogens, screen for depression and anxiety, clarify relationship dynamics and partner sexual function, and document specific sexual domains affected, because these drive management more than hormone levels per se [^113Etdki] [^115hhRKU] [^111QMrMq] [^116asgJ4].

> Next, I should review the examination and basic evaluation. I need to check for genitourinary syndrome of menopause with a targeted pelvic exam, assess for dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and provoked pain triggers, and look for signs of androgen excess or thyroid dysfunction that could redirect management. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; treating GSM and other reversible contributors often improves sexual pain and secondarily desire, so these should be addressed early before attributing symptoms to androgen deficiency or proceeding to testosterone therapy [^115Dr2ZD] [^114HcD8i].

> Now to the hormone testing controversy, where I need to be precise about guideline divergence. Approach A, the conservative SOGC recommendation, is not to obtain serum androgen measurements for evaluating female sexual dysfunction, given poor correlation of endogenous androgens with sexual function and the risk of overtreatment when no diagnostic cutoffs exist. Approach B, from ISSWSH sexual medicine guidance, is to selectively obtain baseline total testosterone and SHBG if considering testosterone therapy, not for diagnosing HSDD but to exclude women with midrange-to-high baseline testosterone (unlikely to benefit), identify high SHBG that may blunt response, and establish a safety baseline. Wait, let me verify the shared principle here: both camps agree there is no diagnostic androgen threshold for HSDD, so any testing is for selection and monitoring, not diagnosis [^114FiMx5] [^113Ytegm] [^113stVjP] [^111gK2zf].

> If testing is pursued, I need to ensure methodologic accuracy because female-range testosterone is challenging to assay. I should confirm the lab uses LC-MS/MS or GC-MS for total testosterone when possible, recognize that direct immunoassays are unreliable in the female range, calculate free or bioavailable testosterone if truly needed while acknowledging limitations, and anchor interpretation to lab-specific premenopausal reference ranges rather than treating to a numeric target. Hold on, I should verify that SHBG can be measured with standard immunoassays and used to interpret bioavailability in context, particularly when oral estrogens or thyroid states alter SHBG [^111iTU1y] [^114e6NH5] [^113stVjP].

> For interpreting results, I need to remember there is no biochemical threshold that diagnoses HSDD, so a low or normal testosterone level cannot confirm a hormonal cause, and a high baseline testosterone may predict poor response to exogenous therapy. Let me double-check SHBG effects: oral estrogens, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism can elevate SHBG and reduce bioavailable testosterone, potentially reducing response to therapy, which means I should address modifiable factors first. But wait, what if SHBG is high from unmodifiable factors such as essential thyroid replacement? ISSWSH still allows a trial with careful monitoring, emphasizing safety and symptom response rather than a numeric target [^111gK2zf] [^113stVjP].

> When should I consider testosterone therapy? I should confirm a diagnosis of postmenopausal HSDD after comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment, document distress, rule out or address modifiable factors first, and ensure the problem is not primarily due to relationship issues, mental health conditions, or medications. I should also confirm that baseline total testosterone is not already in the mid-to-high premenopausal range, because benefit is unlikely in that situation, and I must counsel that in the U.S. this is off-label with limited long-term safety data, necessitating shared decision-making and clear outcome goals before initiation [^111QMrMq] [^115WiJ3a].

> I will now examine the monitoring protocol if therapy is initiated. I need to check baseline total testosterone and SHBG, reassess total testosterone at 3–6 weeks to gauge absorption and guide dose titration, and repeat within 6 weeks after any dose change, then space to every 6–12 months when stable. I should confirm we keep total testosterone within the physiologic premenopausal range for the lab to mitigate androgenic adverse effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice change, and I need to continually reassess symptom benefit against side effects with a plan to discontinue if no meaningful improvement by about 6 months. Hold on, I should verify safety: long-term cardiovascular and breast safety beyond 2 years remains uncertain, although available transdermal RCTs show moderate efficacy with mostly mild androgenic adverse events at physiologic dosing [^113stVjP] [^112kAd89] [^113xxYe5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I see a duplication in the earlier outline where Step 6 and Step 7 were repeated; I initially restated indications and monitoring twice as separate blocks. Let me reconsider and correct that by consolidating the indication for therapy into one step and the monitoring and safety strategy into the subsequent step so the care pathway is linear: confirm HSDD and suitability, then initiate a carefully titrated, monitored trial with predefined stop rules if ineffective [^1171rB56].

> Next, I should review first-line and adjunctive therapies that often precede or accompany any consideration of testosterone. I need to ensure GSM is treated with vaginal estrogen when lubricants and moisturizers are inadequate, consider systemic menopausal hormone therapy when indicated for broader menopausal symptoms acknowledging modest sexual function benefits, incorporate sex therapy or psychotherapy for relational or psychological contributors, and consider nonhormonal pharmacotherapy such as flibanserin for postmenopausal HSDD where appropriate, understanding effect sizes and safety profiles in shared decision-making [^115Dr2ZD] [^111y6DsK] [^116fXzN3] [^113Etdki] [^112RG2DS].

> For a practical algorithm, I need to ensure clarity and decision points. First, conduct a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment documenting distress and modifiable contributors; second, examine for GSM and other reversible factors and treat them; third, reassess symptoms after addressing contributors; fourth, only if HSDD persists and testosterone therapy is being considered, obtain baseline total testosterone by LC-MS/MS and SHBG for selection and safety, not diagnosis; fifth, start low-dose transdermal testosterone, recheck levels at 3–6 weeks, titrate to stay within premenopausal range, and monitor for androgenic effects; sixth, if there is no clinically meaningful improvement by approximately 6 months, discontinue and revisit the biopsychosocial differential, whereas if benefit occurs, continue for 6–12 months and consider a drug holiday to confirm ongoing need. I should double-check that expectations are framed around moderate benefit and safety uncertainties, with explicit stop criteria and follow-up intervals [^1171rB56] [^113stVjP] [^115VGrYm].

> Let me verify the evidence signal that underpins this plan. Placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate a modest improvement in sexual desire and satisfying sexual events with physiologic-dose transdermal testosterone in postmenopausal HSDD, including in surgically menopausal women on estrogen, with androgenic adverse events generally mild at physiologic levels but with limited long-term safety data, reinforcing the need for careful selection, monitoring, and time-limited trials with discontinuation if ineffective [^113xxYe5] [^115UqKrR] [^111QMrMq] [^112kAd89].

For postmenopausal women with decreased libido, **testosterone testing is not routinely recommended** [^114FiMx5] because androgen levels do not reliably predict sexual function [^111gK2zf] and assays lack standardization [^111iTU1y]. Instead, use a **biopsychosocial assessment** [^111QMrMq] to identify modifiable factors [^115hhRKU] and confirm HSDD [^111gK2zf]. If testosterone therapy is considered, measure total testosterone and SHBG before starting, repeat at 3–6 weeks to avoid supraphysiologic levels [^113stVjP], and monitor for androgenic effects; stop if no benefit by 6 months [^115VGrYm]. Estrogen or DHEA testing is not indicated for libido assessment, and routine hormone panels are not recommended [^111gK2zf].

---

## Hormonal changes post menopause and their impact on libido

- **Estrogen decline**: Reduced vaginal lubrication, elasticity, and increased dyspareunia, indirectly affecting libido [^112AEvsA] [^113xW3KT].
- **Testosterone decline**: Gradual age-related decline, not menopause-specific; role in libido is complex and not fully understood [^113xW3KT] [^111gK2zf].
- **DHEA decline**: Adrenal precursor decline may contribute to reduced sexual function [^114QCUzu] [^111iTU1y].

---

## Recommended hormonal evaluations

### Testosterone

- **Routine testing**: Not recommended for evaluating decreased libido in postmenopausal women [^114FiMx5] [^111QMrMq].
- **Clinical utility**: No clear correlation between testosterone levels and sexual function; no diagnostic threshold exists [^111gK2zf] [^111QMrMq].
- **Assay limitations**: Significant variability and lack of standardization limit clinical utility [^111gK2zf] [^111iTU1y].

---

### Estrogen

Routine estrogen testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido, as levels do not directly correlate with libido and testing does not guide management.

---

### DHEA

Routine DHEA testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido, as evidence supporting routine DHEA testing or supplementation for libido is limited.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Hormone** | **Routine testing recommended?** | **Clinical utility** | **Assay limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Testosterone | No | - No clear correlation with libido [^111gK2zf] <br/> - No diagnostic threshold | - Significant variability [^111iTU1y] <br/> - Lack of standardization [^111iTU1y] |
| Estrogen | No | Does not directly correlate with libido | Not specified |
| DHEA | No | Limited evidence for clinical utility | Not specified |

---

## Alternative clinical approaches

Given the limited utility of hormone testing, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is recommended:

- **Biopsychosocial assessment**: Identify modifiable factors (psychological, relational, medical) contributing to decreased libido [^111gK2zf] [^115hhRKU].
- **Counseling and education**: Address psychological and relational factors [^111gK2zf] [^113Etdki].
- **Hormone therapy**: Consider transdermal testosterone for diagnosed HSDD after thorough assessment [^111gK2zf] [^1171rB56] [^113xxYe5].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor testosterone levels and clinical response [^113stVjP]; discontinue if no benefit within 6 months [^115VGrYm].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Routine hormone testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido in postmenopausal women [^114FiMx5]. Testosterone therapy should be considered only following a thorough biopsychosocial assessment and diagnosis of HSDD [^111QMrMq]. If used, monitor testosterone levels and clinical response, and discontinue therapy if there is no benefit within 6 months [^113stVjP] [^115VGrYm].

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured, as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels, testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

### Managing menopause [^114FiMx5]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, specifically concerning the evaluation of sexual dysfunction, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend not to obtain serum androgen measurements for the evaluation of female sexual dysfunction.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111gK2zf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain because of issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies, and insufficient data. The physiology of androgens is complex due to their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues. No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women**: There are recommendations for using systemic testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women, in doses approximating physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women. These recommendations are based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs. However, there are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treating sexual function or any other outcome.

- **Testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)**: Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function. This includes increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, in sexual function such as an average of one additional satisfying sexual event per month and improvements in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^1171rB56]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women recommends testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

- **Aim**: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone, including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with HSDD.

- **Methods**: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

- **Outcomes**: A clinically useful guideline was developed following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD. The guideline includes measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

- **Results**: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support its use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD that is not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Figure 1**: Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years.
	- Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia, and osteoporosis should be considered as potential indicators.
	- Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting.
	- **Measurement Protocol**: Measure TT when the patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 AM.
	- **Assess Serum Free Testosterone (FT)**: On confirmatory sample, use an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected. Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone, focusing instead on the interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach aligns with assessing serum free testosterone accurately.
	- **Investigation for Cause**: Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis, and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated, and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes a review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging is also recommended in these cases.

### Endocrine aspects of female sexual dysfunction [^1153mDMp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Various endogenous hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin, may influence female sexual function.

- **Aim**: To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of women with endocrinologic sexual difficulties.

- **Methods**: The Endocrine Aspects of Female Sexual Dysfunction Committee was part of a multidisciplinary International Consultation. It included four experts from two countries and several peer reviewers.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on committee discussion, a comprehensive literature review, and evidence-based grading of available publications.

- **Results**: The impact of hormones on female sexual function and their etiological roles in dysfunction is complex. Research data are limited as studies have been hampered by a lack of precise hormonal assays and validated measures of sexual function in women. Sex steroid insufficiency is associated with urogenital atrophy and may also adversely affect central sexual thought processes. Systemic estrogen/estrogen progestin therapy alleviates climacteric symptoms, but there is no evidence that this therapy specifically improves hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal or postmenopausal women. Exogenous testosterone has been shown in small randomized controlled trials (RCT) to improve sexual desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, as there is no biochemical measure that clearly identifies who to treat, the use of exogenous testosterone should be considered only after other causes of HSDD have been excluded.

### Testosterone and cardiovascular disease [^111aKJmZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone (T) is the principal male sex hormone. As men age, T levels typically fall. Symptoms of low T include decreased libido, vasomotor instability, and decreased bone mineral density. Other symptoms may include depression, fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and reduced muscle strength/mass. Epidemiology studies show that low levels of T are associated with more atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular events. However, treating hypogonadism in the aging male has resulted in discrepant results regarding its effect on cardiovascular events. Emerging studies suggest that T may have a future role in treating heart failure, angina, and myocardial ischemia. A large, prospective, long-term study of T replacement, with a primary endpoint of a composite of adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or cardiovascular death, is needed. The Food and Drug Administration recently put additional restrictions on T replacement therapy labeling and called for additional studies to determine its cardiac safety.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

This patient might have experienced a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after approximately six months. A sense of well-being and sexual function are complex, depending on multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the HPT axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, after attempts to treat reversible causes, are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less.

An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in the sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by the restoration of normal HPT axis function through weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115Dr2ZD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, specifically the management of vulvovaginal atrophy, the 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend offering low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy to patients without a history of hormone/estrogen-dependent cancers. This therapy is intended for those seeking relief from symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, including vulvovaginal atrophy, when symptoms persist despite the use of vaginal lubricants and moisturizers.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, increasing from 0.6% in men aged 50 to 59 years to 5.1% in men aged 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Similarly, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalence of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is complicated by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid disease, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis (i.e. reverse causality).

### Randomized controlled trial to evaluate transdermal testosterone in female cancer survivors with decreased libido; North Central Cancer Treatment Group protocol N02C3 [^115x8WvR]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). High credibility.

Decreased libido is one of several changes in sexual function often experienced by female cancer patients. Transdermal testosterone therapy has been associated with increased libido among estrogen-replete women who report low libido.

- **Methods**: In a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, we evaluated whether transdermal testosterone would increase sexual desire in female cancer survivors. Postmenopausal women with a history of cancer and no evidence of disease were eligible if they reported a decrease in sexual desire and had a sexual partner. Eligible women were randomly assigned to receive 2% testosterone in Vanicream for a testosterone dose of 10 mg daily or placebo Vanicream for 4 weeks. They then crossed over to the opposite treatment for an additional 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was sexual desire or libido, as measured using the desire subscales of the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, assessed at baseline and at the end of 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Serum levels of bioavailable testosterone were measured at the same times. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We enrolled 150 women. Women on active testosterone cream had higher serum levels of bioavailable testosterone than women on placebo. The mean change from baseline was 11.57% for testosterone versus 0% for placebo at week 4, with a difference of 11.57% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.49% to 14.65%; p < 0.001). At week 8, the change was 10.21% for testosterone versus 0.28% for placebo, with a difference of 9.92% (95% CI = 5.42% to 14.42%; p < 0.001 for all). However, the average intrapatient libido change…

### Sexual functioning in 4,418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: A qualitative free-text analysis [^113HGypC]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Sexual problems were sometimes linked to medication use, both for women and their partners (204/2,883; 7.1%). Most responses referred to drug-related loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, or the inability to have penetrative sex. Few women mentioned that these problems had been restricting their sex life for many years, whereas others had accepted the situation: "My husband is on medication which prevents him from getting an erection. However, we are both quite happy with a kiss and cuddle after 42 years of marriage" (64 y; inactive).

Many of these physical health-related problems had significant effects on sexual function. Some women reported that they or their partner were embarrassed and reluctant to discuss sexual issues with a healthcare provider: "My husband is taking tablets which may or may not make him impotent. At 75, he thinks it is not necessary to discuss that with his GP [primary care physician]; I disagree" (68 y; inactive).

Help-seeking and treatment for sexual problems were only mentioned by 174 participants (174/2,883; 6%), predominantly by sexually active women (143/174; 82.2%). A primary healthcare professional, usually a primary care physician, was the main source of support for participants who disclosed this information. Erection-enhancing medication (e.g. sildenafil) was often mentioned in relation to erectile dysfunction. Interventions used for menopause-related symptoms were mostly vaginal lubricants or moisturizers and hormone creams, or past use of systemic hormone therapy (HT) was mentioned by 63 women (2.2%).

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116asgJ4]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

The scales included in this review were designed to measure sexual functioning. None, however, can be used to diagnose female sexual dysfunction (FSD) because they do not include measures of distress. Only two newer studies measured sexual distress using a single item from the revised Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS-R). Future clinical trials investigating sexual function should also measure sexual distress, which may help reduce stigma around low sexual functioning during the menopausal transition. Because the revised Female Sexual Distress Scale needs further validation in this population, these results, however, were not included in the review. Traditionally, an FSFI score lower than 26.55 has been used to indicate clinical levels of sexual dysfunction; however, new evidence suggests that a cutoff score lower than 21 is associated with greater sexual distress. In addition, different scales can lead to different prevalence estimates within the same population, which can influence the estimated clinical effect of the intervention and may also explain some of the observed heterogeneity. Furthermore, using the FSFI with sexually inactive women could lead to an underestimation of the overall effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function composite score.

### Testosterone for low libido in postmenopausal women not taking estrogen [^113xxYe5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy are unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in which 814 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder were randomly assigned to receive a patch delivering 150 or 300 micrograms of testosterone per day or placebo. Efficacy was measured to week 24; safety was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks, with a subgroup of participants followed for an additional year. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes.

- **Results**: At 24 weeks, the increase in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes was significantly greater in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (an increase of 2.1 episodes vs. 0.7, P < 0.001) but not in the group receiving 150 micrograms per day (1.2 episodes, P = 0.11). As compared with placebo, both doses of testosterone were associated with significant increases in desire (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04) and decreases in distress (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04). The rate of androgenic adverse events, primarily unwanted hair growth, was higher in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (30.0% vs. 23.1%). Breast cancer was diagnosed in four women who received testosterone (as compared with none who received placebo); one of the four received the diagnosis in the first four months.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114e6NH5]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Are there normal values and treatment targets**: As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were "plugged into" the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/L). The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

- **Study by Guay et al. (2004)**: An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

- **Limitations in clinical practice**: The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons: (1) the small sample sizes of the original publications; (2) insufficient accuracy and precision of RIA testosterone measurements.

### Associations among physiological and subjective sexual response, sexual desire, and salivary steroid hormones in healthy premenopausal women [^115RLTVc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined how sexual arousal influences healthy premenopausal women's hormones, limiting our understanding of basic physiology and our ability to transfer knowledge from clinical and nonhuman populations.

- **Aim**: To examine how sexual arousal and steroid hormones (testosterone [T], cortisol [C], estradiol [E]) were linked, to see whether hormone levels influenced and/or changed in response to sexual arousal elicited via visual erotic stimuli in healthy women.

- **Methods**: Participants included 40 healthy premenopausal women not using exogenous hormones.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change in genital sexual arousal (vaginal pulse amplitude), change in subjective sexual arousal, and sexual desire (via the Sexual Desire Inventory and Female Sexual Function Index scales). Saliva samples were taken to measure T, C, and E levels before and after viewing erotic stimuli as genital arousal was recorded via a vaginal photoplethysmograph.

- **Results**: E increased in response to sexual stimuli but was not statistically associated with genital sexual arousal, whereas C decreased in association with genital sexual arousal, and T showed no statistically significant change. Relationship status was linked to genital but not subjective sexual arousal; dating women exhibited higher genital sexual arousal than single or partnered women. Results indicated that all three hormones were associated with self-reported genital arousal (via the Detailed Assessment of Sexual Arousal scales) and sexual desire in different domains, and both T and E were associated with self-reported outcomes.

### Androgen use for low sexual desire in midlife women [^116jod7A]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Andrea, a 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, is concerned about her loss of desire for sexual activity. Her last menstrual period occurred 2 years ago, and she has experienced minimal vasomotor symptoms. She has a loving relationship with her husband, to whom she has been married for 5 years, and with whom she has previously enjoyed sexual intimacy, often initiating it. She is disturbed by the fact that not only does she have no sexual desire, but she has also become unresponsive to her husband's sexual advances. The problem predates menopause by 1 to 2 years. She has recently heard that testosterone may be a treatment for this and wants to know what options are available.

Regarding the medical management of female sexual dysfunction, particularly in the context of managing genitourinary syndrome of menopause with systemic estrogen, the ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend offering low-dose systemic hormone therapy. This therapy can include estrogen alone or in combination with progestin as an alternative to low-dose vaginal estrogen for patients experiencing dyspareunia related to genitourinary syndrome of menopause, as well as vasomotor symptoms.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^115wW8UD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The brain is one of the most important targets for sex hormones throughout the lifespan. Some research supports the role of estradiol in the central modulation of sexual desire. Other research demonstrates that testosterone has enduring influences on many neural and behavioral functions via both genomic and nongenomic actions. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the influence of testosterone on sexual behavior in women are still not completely understood. It remains unclear whether testosterone positively modulates sexual desire in women through direct stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or through its conversion to estrogen and subsequent binding to estrogen receptors.

Consistent with preclinical data, two lines of evidence point toward a direct, AR-mediated effect of testosterone on sexual behavior in women. One is based on the fact that estrogen-alone therapy in postmenopausal women was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, with no effect on libido, sexual desire, and interest. Second, in a study of postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol and testosterone gel randomized to an aromatase inhibitor or placebo, total and free testosterone in the physiologic range was associated with improvement in sexual satisfaction, well-being, and mood. Aromatase inhibition did not appear to influence the outcome. Existing evidence therefore suggests that testosterone conversion into estradiol is not necessary to exert its beneficial effects on sexuality.

### Comparative effects of oral esterified estrogens with and without methyltestosterone on endocrine profiles and dimensions of sexual function in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire [^111izkef]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

In some women, a decline in sexual interest accompanies a relative androgen insufficiency after menopause. We sought to characterize the hormonal effects of the combination of oral esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone and to investigate whether this regimen improves hypoactive sexual desire.

- **Design**: Double-blind randomized trial.
- **Setting**: Healthy volunteers in a multicenter research environment.
- **Patient(S)**: Postmenopausal women taking estrogen therapy who were experiencing hypoactive sexual desire.
- **Intervention(S)**: Four months of treatment with 0.625 mg of esterified estrogens (n = 111) or the combination of 0.625 mg of esterified estrogens and 1.25 mg of methyltestosterone (n = 107).
- **Main outcome measures**: Baseline and end-of-study measurements of total and bioavailable testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and mean change in level of sexual interest or desire as rated on the Sexual Interest Questionnaire.

Results indicated that treatment with the combination of esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone significantly increased the concentration of bioavailable testosterone and suppressed SHBG. Scores measuring sexual interest or desire and frequency of desire increased from baseline with combination treatment and were significantly greater than those achieved with esterified estrogens alone. Treatment with the combination was well tolerated.

In conclusion, increased circulating levels of unbound testosterone and suppression of SHBG provide a plausible hormonal explanation for the significantly improved sexual functioning in women receiving the combination treatment.

### Testosterone use for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^115WiJ3a]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone is an important evidence-based therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women. Clinical practice guidelines, based on the most comprehensive meta-analysis of benefits and risks of testosterone therapy at the time of writing, state that the sole evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy is HSDD in postmenopausal women. The guidelines also provide recommendations regarding identification of patients, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. This Practice Pearl discusses evidence-based testosterone therapy for the management of HSDD in postmenopausal women.

### Testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^1174dHYa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Data do not support the role of testosterone treatment in supporting bone health or brain health or improving energy or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking testosterone treatment.

### The effects of tibolone on mood and libido [^115cvRTW]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

To review published data pertaining to the effects of tibolone on sexual parameters, mood, and cognitive function in postmenopausal women, a review of all relevant published, peer-reviewed studies was conducted. Tibolone is a compound that can be selectively metabolized by individual tissues to its estrogenic, progestogenic, or androgenic metabolites and hence exhibits tissue-specific hormonal effects. It also lowers sex hormone binding globulin, thus increasing free estradiol and testosterone levels.

Tibolone alleviates climacteric vasomotor symptoms and displays a dominant progestogenic effect on the endometrium. It normalizes the vaginal karyopyknotic and maturation indexes and alleviates symptomatic atrophic vaginitis. Women treated with tibolone report significant reductions in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, effects that may be secondary to both estrogenic as well as androgenic actions.

Randomized studies indicate tibolone has positive effects on mood compared with placebo and alleviates several adverse mood parameters to a similar extent as conventional hormone replacement therapy. Improved mood is associated with increased plasma beta-endorphin. With respect to cognition, tibolone seems to improve semantic memory but does not significantly improve recognition memory. Tibolone is associated with improvements in sexual function that seem to be greater than those achieved with standard hormone replacement therapy.

Published studies indicate beneficial effects of tibolone on both libido and mood, which otherwise significantly compromise quality of life for postmenopausal women.

### Endocrine aspects of sexual dysfunction in men [^112qZobR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Endocrine disorders of sex steroid hormones may adversely affect men's sexual function. This paper aims to provide expert opinions and recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders.

- **Methods**: An international consultation, in collaboration with major urology and sexual medicine associations, assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topics represent the opinion of experts from five continents, developed through a scientific and debate process. Regarding the Endocrine committee, there were eight experts from seven countries.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinions and recommendations are based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion over two years, and public presentation and deliberation.

- **Results**: Hypogonadism is a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by a deficiency in serum androgen levels, which may decrease sexual interest, quality of erections, and quality of life. Biochemical investigations include testosterone and either bioavailable or calculated free testosterone; prolactin should be considered when hypogonadism has been documented. If clinically indicated, androgen therapy should maintain testosterone within the physiological range, avoiding supraphysiologic values.

### A 60-year-old woman with sexual difficulties [^112wS4Pu]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence is available to guide care for women with sexual concerns. This article considers the case of a 60-year-old woman who, with menopause, developed decreased libido, rapidity of sexual arousal, and intensity of orgasm. She requests information about strategies to optimize sexual function. Effects of aging and menopause on female sexual response are reviewed, and an evaluation approach is presented to help clinicians respond productively to women who request intervention.

The effectiveness and safety of different treatment options are discussed, including education, lifestyle changes, counseling, medications, mechanical devices, and pelvic floor exercises. Recommendations are made to help postmenopausal women maximize sexual pleasure and satisfaction.

### Synarel [^112xp5Cj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adverse events reported most frequently in clinical studies with Synarel are associated with hypoestrogenism. The most commonly reported are hot flashes, headaches, emotional lability, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, acne, myalgia, and reduction in breast size. Estrogen levels returned to normal after treatment was discontinued. Nasal irritation occurred in about 10% of patients who used intranasal nafarelin.

- **Bone density considerations**: The induced hypoestrogenic state results in a small loss in bone density over the course of treatment, some of which may not be reversible. During one six-month treatment period, this bone loss should not be important. However, in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content — such as chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, a strong family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids — therapy with Synarel may pose an additional risk. In these patients, the risks and benefits must be weighed carefully before therapy with Synarel is instituted. Repeated courses of treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs are not advisable in patients with major risk factors for loss of bone mineral content.

- **Depression risks**: Inform patients that depression may occur or worsen during treatment with GnRH agonists, including Synarel, especially in patients with a history of depression. Advise patients to immediately report thoughts and behaviors of concern to healthcare providers [see Warnings].

Patients with interRhinitis should consult their physician for the use of a topical n.

### A systematic review of randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy for female sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women [^114Gx4v2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical sequelae of estrogen deficiency during menopause are undisputed. However, the pathophysiological role of testosterone during menopause is less clear. Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that testosterone therapy improves sexual function in postmenopausal women. Additionally, some studies indicate that testosterone therapy has other effects, such as increased bone mineral density and decreased serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Furthermore, the long-term safety profile of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women remains uncertain. This article provides a concise and critical summary of the literature to guide clinicians treating postmenopausal women.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111iTU1y]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Role of laboratory evaluation of androgen levels in managing HSDD**: Direct assays measure total testosterone in women using the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. These assays have not been standardized for this purpose at either a national or international level, and total testosterone concentrations may be reported as being substantially different for a single sample by different laboratories. Hence, direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range. Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid chromatography (LC)/gas chromatography (GC) and LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assays. However, it is important to note that LC-GC and LC-MS/MS have also not been internationally standardized. If neither LC-GC nor LC-MS/MS is available, measurement of total testosterone using direct assays routinely used in clinical laboratories is appropriate.

- **Association between androgen levels and aging**: Androgen levels decline with age and drop abruptly after bilateral oophorectomy. The decline in androgen levels in postmenopausal women appears to be a function of age, aging ovarian function, and decrease in adrenal precursor steroids. Cross-sectional studies of healthy women demonstrate a substantial decrease in androgen levels across the reproductive years with no significant change across the menopausal transition (ages 45–54 years). In one study, women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy (aged 55 years or older), not on exogenous steroids, had 40–5.

### Testosterone for midlife women: The hormone of desire [^115hSvRm]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Testosterone declines with aging, so most midlife women have "low" testosterone levels. Because libido also declines with aging, and distressing sexual problems peak at midlife, should midlife women with low libido and associated distress be treated with testosterone? This Practice Pearl reports clinical trial evidence, reviews the risks, and explains how testosterone might be used in a clinical setting. For women who may be considering a trial of testosterone therapy, limitations and adverse effects should be disclosed, and appropriate monitoring should be instituted once treatment has begun.

### Management of female sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women by testosterone administration: Safety issues and controversies [^112RF8z2]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A Food and Drug Administration advisory group has questioned the long-term safety of testosterone administration to postmenopausal women. Although only short-term data exist on safety from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, testosterone has been used for more than 50 years, so some data concerning the long-term safety issues must exist in the literature.

- **Aim**: To review the published data concerning the safety of administration of testosterone to women.

- **Methods**: This involves a review of published articles identified by a search of the Ovid databases and bibliographies from articles identified as dealing with the topics of testosterone or androgen treatment of women.

- **Results**: The major adverse reactions to exogenous androgens are the expected androgenic side effects of hirsutism and acne. High-density lipoprotein levels may be decreased with oral androgens. There are insufficient long-term safety data regarding breast, endometrium, or heart safety to draw strong conclusions, although the data available at the time of writing are reassuring.

- **Conclusions**: Testosterone administration to postmenopausal women that result in physiological to slightly supraphysiological serum-free testosterone levels is safe for at least 2 years.

### Predictors of decreased libido in women during the late reproductive years [^1144Y6wi]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for decreased libido among women in the late reproductive years.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort. Women aged 35 to 47 years were identified through random digit dialing and prospectively followed for 4 years with serial hormone assays and standardized questionnaires. Mean hormone values, hormone trends over 4 years, and fluctuation in hormone levels were compared among women with and without a decrease in libido at the last assessment period. Total testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, body mass index, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: Of 326 women, 87 (27%) reported a decreased libido, whereas 239 (73%) did not. Participant-specific means for all hormone levels over the study period were similar among both groups. However, total testosterone fluctuation over the study was significantly different between groups. Women whose testosterone levels fluctuated from 3.8 to 21.5 ng/dL around a mean value of 9 ng/dL were four times more likely to report decreased libido compared with women with little fluctuation in testosterone [odds ratio (OR) 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6–10.0]. Depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9–6.1), vaginal dryness (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8–6.6), and children living at home (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) were also independently associated with decreased libido.

- **Conclusions**: Decreased libido in the late reproductive years is associated with a pronounced fluctuation in total testosterone over time. Other independent risk factors include depression, vaginal dryness, and having children living at home.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a man with potentially low serum testosterone begins with determining his pretest probability of hypogonadism. Importantly, there is a significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and those of depression. For instance, the patient reported symptoms such as depressed mood and fatigue. Evaluating him with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, he screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment of symptoms and signs more specific to hypogonadism is crucial. In particular, the European Male Ageing Study highlighted that three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with low serum testosterone in a syndromic manner. Of these, diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. However, this epidemiology study cannot establish causality. It is suggested that reduced sexual activity could lower serum testosterone, indicating the possibility of reverse causation in the association observed between sexual symptoms and low testosterone levels in this study. Furthermore, prevalence of these sexual symptoms was found to be 25% to 35% even among men with normal serum testosterone levels.

Symptoms like fatigue and low mood are considered nonspecific for hypogonadism and possess low diagnostic value as they could also be due to systemic diseases. The presence of such symptoms, in conjunction with possible sexual dysfunction, complicates the diagnostic picture.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^111y6DsK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints. This review is an update of a review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to assess the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Search methods**: On 19 December 2022, we searched the Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, two trial registries, and OpenGrey. This was done together with reference checking and contact with experts in the field for any additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared hormone therapy to either placebo or no intervention (control) using any validated assessment tool to evaluate sexual function. We considered hormone therapy to include: estrogen alone; estrogen in combination with progestogens; synthetic steroids, such as tibolone; selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene and bazedoxifene; and SERMs in combination with estrogen.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Data were analyzed using mean differences (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs). The primary outcome was the sexual function score. Secondary outcomes were the domains of sexual response: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 36 studies with a total of 23,299 women; 12,225 in the intervention group and 11,074 in the control group.

### Blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms [^112Sp4X3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

There are few systematic studies of the relationship between blood testosterone concentrations and the symptoms of overt androgen deficiency. Because most testosterone preparations are relatively short-term, the rapid changes in blood testosterone concentrations they cause make it difficult to define any testosterone threshold. By contrast, subdermal testosterone implants provide stable blood testosterone concentrations over days to weeks, while gradually declining to baseline over 5–7 months. Hence, this provides an opportunity to define a blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms by observing androgen-deficient men as their familiar androgen deficiency symptoms return as testosterone pellets slowly dissolve.

Among 52 androgen-deficient men who underwent 260 implantations over 5 years, at the time of return of androgen deficiency symptoms, the blood total and free testosterone concentrations were highly reproducible within individuals (F = 0.8, P = 0.49 and F = 1.4, P = 0.24, respectively) but varied markedly between men (F = 167 and F = 138, both P < 0.001), indicating that each person had a consistent testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms that differed markedly between individuals. The most reported symptoms of androgen deficiency were lack of energy, lack of motivation, and reduced libido. The symptomatic threshold was significantly lower in men with secondary hypogonadism compared with men with primary or mixed hypogonadism (total, 9.7 ± 0.5 nmol/liter vs. 11.7 ± 0.4 nmol/liter and 10.2 ± 0.3 nmol/liter, P = 0.006; free, 146 ± 10 p).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116ub51F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for menopause, specifically the management of vasomotor symptoms, the 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend considering initiating estrogen therapy (after hysterectomy) or estrogen plus progestogen therapy (without hysterectomy). This recommendation is for menopausal patients who are younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years past menopause with bothersome vasomotor symptoms, with or without additional climacteric symptoms. These patients should not have contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and must be willing to take menopausal hormone therapy.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of a clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurement, and the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine. In such cases, circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells. The complex regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase, as well as differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desire or if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for assessing androgen effects on sexual desire.

- **Rationale for testosterone therapy in women**: Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration during treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when physiological levels typical of premenopausal women are achieved.

### Efficacy of vaginally applied estrogen, testosterone, or polyacrylic acid on sexual function in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^113eDhrm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Female libido is multifactorial and complex, with declining estrogen levels in postmenopausal women affecting vaginal function. The aim of this study was to evaluate female sexual function after using topical estrogen, testosterone, or polyacrylic acid as vaginal lubricants, with K-Y jelly as a placebo lubricant.

This randomized controlled clinical trial involved 80 postmenopausal women between 40 and 70 years of age, with follow-up at the Menopause Clinic of the CAISM at Unicamp. The women were randomized to treatment with topical vaginal estrogen, testosterone, polyacrylic acid, or oil lubricant alone, three times a week for a period of 12 weeks from November 2011 to January 2013.

The main outcome measure was the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), used to assess changes in sexual response at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, polyacrylic acid and topical testosterone produced improvements in the FSFI domains of sexual desire, lubrication, satisfaction, reduced pain during intercourse, and total score compared to lubricant alone. Treatment with topical estrogen showed an improvement in the FSFI field of desire compared with lubricant alone. The intragroup analysis over the treatment time showed improvements in the fields of desire, lubrication, and reduced pain for polyacrylic acid, testosterone, and estrogen. Furthermore, women who used testosterone showed improvements over time in the fields of arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction.

In conclusion, treatment of postmenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal a.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^1177BtEh]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women recommends testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The aim of this guideline is to provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone, including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with HSDD.

Methods: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts. They performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

Outcomes: A clinically useful guideline was developed following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD. This includes aspects such as measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

Results: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy only for postmenopausal women, limited data also support its use in late reproductive age premenopausal women. This is consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit.

### Hormones and sexuality during transition to menopause [^114QCUzu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between reproductive hormonal dynamics and sexual dysfunction assessed in a cohort of women approaching menopause, women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study were assessed at yearly intervals for three years. These assessments included early follicular hormone measurements such as estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total testosterone, anthropometric measures, and extensive questionnaires, including the Female Sexual Function Index. Univariable analyses were performed to determine the association between hormones, menopausal status, and sexual dysfunction. Additionally, multivariable linear and logistic regression models were created to examine the influence of hormones on sexual function while adjusting for potential confounders.

The final multivariable model indicated that sexual dysfunction increased with advanced menopausal status, with postmenopausal women being 2.3 times more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to premenopausal women (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–4.1). Low DHEAS serum concentrations were associated with decreased sexual function (odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.14). Additional risk factors associated with sexual dysfunction included the absence of a sexual partner (11.2, 95% CI 6.9–18.1), high anxiety (3.8, 95% CI 1.6–9.2), and having children under the age of 18 living at home (1.6, 95% CI 1.1–5.5). Specific aspects of sexuality negatively affected by menopause included lubrication, orgasm, and pain.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111QMrMq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical care of postmenopausal women**: Recommendations regarding full assessment of FSD before commencing testosterone therapy suggest that FSD, including HSDD, FSAD, and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction, has multiple etiologies. These include biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and include pharmacologic options (hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents), psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

- **Testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women**: The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is for the treatment of postmenopausal women diagnosed with HSDD after formal biopsychosocial assessment (Level I, Grade A). There is an unmet need for the provision and approval of testosterone treatments specific to women, formulated to approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). Where an appropriate approved female testosterone preparation is not available, off-label prescribing of an approved male formulation is reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained in the physiologic female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded "bioidentical" testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD due to the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent is available.

### Clinical management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^111MVq6j]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% to 12% of women meet the criteria for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, with the highest prevalence in midlife women, ranging from 14.5% to 33%. Despite the negative effect on health and quality of life, most women are reluctant to discuss sexual concerns with healthcare professionals. Although healthcare professionals have the best opportunities to address these problems, most of them have limited awareness, education, and comfort in addressing sexual concerns, resulting in a conspiracy of silence. The purpose of this Practice Pearl is to improve the understanding of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, including symptoms, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Evidence-based guideline: Premature ovarian insufficiency [^111jP62y]. Climacteric (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary ovarian insufficiency, particularly in relation to hormone testing (estradiol), the ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guidelines recommend not diagnosing POI based solely on serum estradiol concentrations. It is important to recognize that a low estradiol concentration indicates hypoestrogenism. When combined with an elevated FSH concentration, it provides additional confirmation of the POI diagnosis.

### Testosterone patch for low sexual desire in surgically menopausal women: a randomized trial [^115UqKrR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of a 300 µg/d testosterone patch for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in surgically menopausal women on concomitant estrogen therapy, a 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Five hundred thirty-three women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder who had undergone previous hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or the testosterone patch twice weekly.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 24 in the frequency of total satisfying sexual activity, measured by the Sexual Activity Log. Secondary measures included sexual desire assessed by the Profile of Female Sexual Function and personal distress measured by the Personal Distress Scale. Hormone levels, adverse events, and clinical laboratory measures were reviewed.

Total satisfying sexual activity significantly improved in the testosterone patch group compared with the placebo group after 24 weeks (mean change from baseline, 1.56 compared with 0.73 episodes per 4 weeks, P = 0.001). Treatment with the testosterone patch also significantly improved sexual desire (mean change, 10.57 compared with 4.29, P < .05). The incidence of androgenic adverse events was higher in the testosterone group; most androgenic adverse events were mild.

### "I want to feel like I used to feel": A qualitative study of causes of low libido in postmenopausal women [^111GaEKg]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Low libido is common among women over 60 and negatively impacts well-being and relationship satisfaction. Causes of low libido in this age group are not well understood. We used qualitative methods to explore older women's perceptions of causes of low libido.

We conducted 15 individual interviews and 3 focus groups (total N = 36) among sexually active women 60 and older who screened positive for low libido using a validated instrument. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using a codebook developed by two investigators. From this analysis, codes were examined, and themes related to the causes of low libido emerged.

Women noted a number of different factors that contributed to low libido. The common factors that women discussed included postmenopausal vaginal symptoms, erectile dysfunction in male partners, fatigue and bodily pain, life stressors, and body image concerns. Women often found ways to adapt to these factors. These adaptations required open communication between partners regarding sex, and some women noted these conversations were difficult or not successful.

A wide variety of factors contribute to low libido in women over 60, but many of these factors are addressable. Low libido in older women should not be automatically attributed to "normal" aging or to menopause; providers should take an approach to assessment and treatment that addresses biological, interpersonal and social, and psychological factors.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^112LPbew]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

The perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Search methods**: We searched for articles in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISI Web of Knowledge, and OpenGrey. The last search was performed in December 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials comparing HT to either placebo or no intervention (control). We considered as HT estrogens alone; estrogens in combination with progestogens; synthetic steroids (for example, tibolone); or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (for example, raloxifene, bazedoxifene). Studies of other drugs possibly used in the relief of menopausal symptoms were excluded. We included studies that evaluated sexual function using any validated assessment tool. The primary outcome was a composite score for sexual function, and the scores for individual domains (arousal and sexual interest, orgasm, and pain) were secondary outcomes. Studies were selected by two authors independently.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were independently extracted by two authors and checked by a third. Risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two authors. We contacted study investigators as required. Data were analyzed using standardized methods.

### Predictors of decreased libido in women during the late reproductive years [^116kESTf]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

The objective was to identify risk factors for decreased libido among women in the late reproductive years.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study involving women aged 35 to 47 years identified through random digit dialing. Participants were followed prospectively for four years with serial hormone assays and standardized questionnaires. Mean hormone values, hormone trends over four years, and fluctuations in hormone levels were compared among women with and without a decrease in libido at the last assessment period. Total testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, body mass index, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: Of the 326 women, 87 (27%) reported decreased libido, whereas 239 (73%) did not. Participant-specific means for all hormone levels over the study period were similar among both groups. However, total testosterone fluctuation over the study was significantly different between groups. Women whose testosterone levels fluctuated from 3.8 to 21.5 ng/dL around a mean value of 9 ng/dL were four times more likely to report decreased libido compared with women with little fluctuation in testosterone [odds ratio (OR) 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6–10.0]. Depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9–6.1), vaginal dryness (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8–6.6), and children living at home (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) were also independently associated with decreased libido.

- **Conclusions**: Decreased libido in the late reproductive years is associated with a pronounced fluctuation in total testosterone over time. Other independent risk factors include depression, vaginal dryness, and having children living at home.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111n8wfL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. In addition, increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause. Premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause include both spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (idiopathic; caused by chromosomal and genetic defects; associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, and environmental factors) and induced ovarian failure resulting from interventions (pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgical oophorectomy, including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations).

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%, younger than 30 years is 0.1%, and younger than 20 years is 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

Long-term safety

A 4-year open-label extension of two 6-month clinical trials investigated the use of a 300 mcg/day transdermal testosterone patch in 967 women with oophorectomy treated with concomitant estrogen therapy. The study showed no increase in the rate of serious adverse events. Additionally, a phase 3 cardiovascular and breast safety randomized controlled trial of a 1% testosterone transdermal gel, 300 mcg daily, was conducted in 2008. It enrolled 3,656 postmenopausal participants over 50 years old, all with at least two cardiovascular risk factors at baseline (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia) and a clinical diagnosis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

The composite cardiovascular endpoint included death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalized unstable angina, and venous thromboembolic events. After 4 years, with more than 7,300 women-years of exposure, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reported 53 adjudicated cardiovascular events, a lower-than-anticipated rate, with the number of breast cancers as anticipated based on participant ages. Although study results have been published in press releases, they have not been published in peer-reviewed publications. Despite these reassuring outcomes, long-term (beyond 2 years) safety data, particularly regarding breast cancer and cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and death, remain limited and inconclusive.

Future strategies to assess safety

Several recent meta-analyses and the 4-year open-label extension trial provide reassurance regarding the safety of transdermal testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women, using doses that approximate physiological levels.

If a woman does not experience clinically meaningful improvement, treatment should not be continued beyond 6 months, and other causes for the symptoms should be reinvestigated. In women not responding to testosterone therapy, measurement of 5α-reductase could be considered, as some experts propose that women with reduced 5α-reductase activity may not respond to physiologic doses of transdermal testosterone. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the expert panel recommended that the woman continue for 6–12 months and then consider taking a drug holiday to see if treatment is still required. Furthermore, the panel concluded that although there is a lack of long-term safety data, ongoing testosterone therapy may be needed to maintain the improvement in HSDD.

Measures of treatment effect

- **Continuous data**: For continuous data, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way (e.g. HDL cholesterol). If the same outcome is reported on different scales (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We plan to treat ordinal data as continuous data and will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

- **Dichotomous data**: For dichotomous (or categorical) data, we will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

- **Multiple intervention groups**: If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention (e.g. two different doses), we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

In cases where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data (e.g. the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and number of people in each group). If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD of other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, or P (probability) values.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decreases, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, defined as the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and are associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This results in a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors, including A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEAS. Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^111EbvfH]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

- **Study quality**: Seventeen of the 20 studies published since December 2012 might suffer from attrition bias given the high amount of missing data. Nevertheless, the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function did not change when excluding studies at high risk of bias. Among these trials, missingness for sexual function was usually higher than other outcomes.

As discussed, proper use of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) could reduce the amount of missing data. In addition, measuring sexual function over a 6-month period rather than 4 weeks could reduce the number of participants excluded after randomization; this has been previously suggested and is validated in women who have sex with women. Similarly, missing data could also be reduced by rephrasing the FSFI to include all forms of vaginal penetration, or by using a measure such as the Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire, which considers nonpenetrative sexual activity.

Furthermore, nearly all studies that investigated sexual satisfaction used the FSFI satisfaction domain; however, one question cannot be answered by unpartnered women, and high rates of missing data for this question were reported in the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) trials. Therefore, restricting inclusion to women who have a partner or using a scale that does not require the responder to have a partner could reduce the amount of missing data. Finally, clinical trial participants may be uncomfortable discussing sexuality compared with other health-related topics, so future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could add willingness to answer sexuality questionnaires as a criterion.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116iXiPd]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Protocol and registration**: The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO on March 30, 2022 (CRD42022320302).

- **Criteria for study inclusion**:
	- **Types of studies**: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Crossover trials were considered, but only data from the first phase were included because urogenital symptoms often reoccur after hormone therapy (HT) is stopped. Studies including only a subset of eligible participants were considered for inclusion when data were reported for the subset of interest.

	- **Types of participants**: Perimenopausal or postmenopausal women were included. Perimenopausal women were defined as women who had their last menstrual period (LMP) within the last 12 months before inclusion. Postmenopausal women were defined as women with menopause induced by a medical intervention or with natural menopause defined as 12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Recently postmenopausal women had their LMP within the last 5 years. Symptomatic menopausal women are women with any menopausal symptom described in Monteleone et al, including vulvovaginal atrophy, vasomotor symptoms, and sexual dysfunction.

	- **Types of interventions**: The intervention of interest is HT compared with control. All HT therapies included in Nastri et al. were considered: estrogen therapy, estrogen plus progestogen therapy, tibolone, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). This review did not include dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone because their effect on sexual function has already been investigated elsewhere. Only trials in which the interval between the onset of the intervention and the assessment were included.

### Biological and psychosocial pathophysiology of female sexual dysfunction during the menopausal transition [^112AEvsA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although increasing age is a primary determinant of reduced sexual function in older women, hormonal changes may significantly contribute to female (and couples') sexual dysfunction.

- **Aim**: To analyze the most relevant biological, psychosexual, and/or contextual factors that influence changes in women's sexuality during and after menopause.

- **Methods**: A Postmenopausal FSD Roundtable, consisting of multidisciplinary international experts, was convened to review specific issues related to postmenopausal women and sexual dysfunction.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on a review of evidence-based medical literature, presentation, and internal discussion.

- **Results**: Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. The primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for irregular menstruation and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss is associated with changes in the vascular, muscular, and urogenital systems, as well as alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning, influencing sexual function both directly and indirectly. The age-dependent decline in testosterone as well as androgen function, starting in the early 20s, may precipitate or exacerbate aspects of female sexual dysfunction. These effects are most pronounced following bilateral ovariectomy and the consequent loss of 50% or more total testosterone. The contribution of progestogens to sexual health and variability in the effects of specific progestogens is being increasingly studied.
