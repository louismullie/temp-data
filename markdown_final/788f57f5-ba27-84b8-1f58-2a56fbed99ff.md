## Question

Do you need low protein diet for gout?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a low-protein diet is necessary for gout management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of gout and how diet influences serum urate. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend about protein and purine intake. Next, I will examine the evidence for whole-diet approaches like DASH and Mediterranean patterns, including randomized and observational data. After that, I need to check whether weight loss changes the calculus. Finally, I will consider special populations such as chronic kidney disease and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: gout results from monosodium urate crystal deposition driven by hyperuricemia, which arises from overproduction and/or underexcretion of uric acid, with purine metabolism contributing to production and renal handling to excretion. Importantly, insulin resistance and adiposity modulate urate handling, so diet can influence serum urate via purine load, fructose effects, and metabolic pathways, but diet alone rarely normalizes urate in established gout [^f1a11d6c] [^22890e6c].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually say about protein and purines. The 2020 ACR guideline conditionally recommends limiting purine intake, not protein per se, and also advises limiting alcohol and high-fructose corn syrup. It does not endorse a low-protein diet, and it emphasizes weight loss for those with overweight/obesity, reflecting the modest effect size of dietary changes on serum urate and the need to balance cardiometabolic risk [^46bed03a] [^2ba24213]. EULAR similarly advises avoiding excessive meat and seafood and encourages low-fat dairy and plant-forward patterns, again focusing on purine sources and overall diet quality rather than total protein restriction [^e2d28356]. BSR guidance aligns with this, recommending a balanced diet low in fat and added sugars, avoidance of sugar-sweetened drinks, and inclusion of low-fat dairy and plant protein sources, not a blanket low-protein approach [^c464c1d3].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "low purine" with "low protein". I initially thought "low purine" meant "low protein", but that's imprecise. Low-purine advice targets specific high-purine animal foods and sweetened beverages, whereas many protein sources — especially plant proteins and low-fat dairy — are encouraged and may even lower urate via uricosuric effects and improved insulin sensitivity, so a low-protein diet is not required and may be counterproductive if it replaces protein with refined carbs or added sugars [^e2d28356] [^c464c1d3] [^22890e6c].

> Next, I should review the evidence for whole-diet patterns. The DASH diet consistently lowers serum urate in randomized feeding studies and is associated with lower incident gout in large prospective cohorts. In OmniHeart, a protein-rich DASH-style diet reduced urate by about 0.16 mg/dL versus carbohydrate- or unsaturated fat–rich DASH variants, with larger absolute reductions in those with hyperuricemia, supporting a plant-forward, higher-protein DASH approach rather than protein restriction [^9f3a4ff5] [^a532beee] [^cdde95d5]. Mediterranean-style patterns also show inverse associations with gout and urate lowering in secondary analyses, reinforcing that the quality and source of protein matter more than total protein quantity [^39bdacdb] [^9511edcc].

> I need to check whether weight loss changes the calculus. Weight loss of about 5–10 kg can lower serum urate by roughly 1–2 mg/dL in small studies and observational data, and the DIRECT trial showed that various weight-loss diets (low-fat, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate) all reduced urate at 6 months, with sustained but smaller effects at 24 months, mediated largely by reduced adiposity and insulin resistance rather than purine restriction per se [^7b9c3ac8] [^39bdacdb]. But wait, what if weight loss alone doesn't translate to fewer flares? A recent randomized trial in obesity with gout achieved substantial weight loss without clear short-term reductions in flares or pain, reminding me that urate lowering and symptom control are related but distinct endpoints and that pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy remains foundational when indicated [^b47e85ca].

> Let me consider special populations, especially chronic kidney disease, where protein advice is different. In CKD, guidelines emphasize limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup to reduce urate and flares, and they prefer xanthine oxidase inhibitors for urate lowering. They do not recommend a low-protein diet for gout per se, though CKD nutrition may involve protein moderation for kidney protection, which is a separate issue from gout pathophysiology and should be individualized with nephrology input [^1c618ce3] [^ad36acd5] [^aeabc10e]. I should double-check that I'm not conflating CKD protein targets with gout management; indeed, gout guidance in CKD focuses on urate-lowering therapy and selective dietary limits rather than blanket protein restriction [^1c618ce3].

> I will now examine the magnitude and clinical relevance of dietary effects so expectations are realistic. Dietary changes typically lower serum urate by about 0.5–1.5 mg/dL, which is meaningful but often insufficient to reach treatment targets in established gout, where pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy to less than 6 mg/dL (and sometimes less than 5 mg/dL in severe disease) is the cornerstone. Thus, diet is an adjunct, not a substitute, for ULT when indicated [^ea2706e3] [^839e9040] [^4d541b27]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines still prioritize ULT initiation for frequent flares, tophi, or radiographic damage; yes, ACR and EULAR continue to recommend ULT in those scenarios, with treat-to-target urate goals guiding titration [^88ca52ab] [^75ca2e1e] [^d44e3f77].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A low-protein diet is not necessary for gout. Instead, current evidence and guidelines support a balanced, plant-forward dietary pattern with adequate protein from low-fat dairy and plant sources, limitation of high-purine red and organ meats and certain seafood, avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages and excess fructose, moderation of alcohol (especially beer), and weight loss for those with overweight/obesity, all aligned with DASH or Mediterranean-style eating and tailored to comorbidities and preferences [^46bed03a] [^e2d28356] [^c464c1d3] [^a532beee] [^9f3a4ff5]. I should emphasize that while these changes can modestly lower urate and improve cardiometabolic health, they are adjuncts to, not replacements for, urate-lowering therapy when clinically indicated, and shared decision-making is essential to sustain adherence over time [^ea2706e3] [^d3f8f19a].

---

You do not need a **low-protein diet** for gout. Modern guidelines recommend **limiting purine intake** (especially from red meat, organ meats, and some seafood) and emphasize a **plant-forward, DASH-style pattern** with low-fat dairy, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains [^46bed03a] [^e2d28356]. Low-protein diets are not advised and may be harmful if they replace protein with refined carbs or added sugars [^22890e6c]. Protein from plants and low-fat dairy is **safe and may lower uric acid** [^9f3a4ff5] [^a532beee]. Weight loss, limiting alcohol, and avoiding sugar-sweetened drinks are key; use urate-lowering therapy when indicated [^7b9c3ac8] [^ea2706e3].

---

## Historical perspective on dietary management of gout

Historically, gout management centered on **strict low-purine diets** that limited protein — especially animal protein — because purines are metabolized to uric acid [^f1a11d6c]. This approach aimed to reduce uric acid production and lower serum urate levels [^dc5b2130]. However, recent evidence shows that **purine restriction alone has modest effects** on serum urate and may be hard to sustain, leading to poor adherence and limited clinical benefit [^f07106ea] [^cdde95d5].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Contemporary guidelines from major rheumatology organizations — including the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) — **do not recommend a low-protein diet** for gout management. Instead, they emphasize:

- **Limiting purine intake**: Especially from red meat, organ meats, and certain seafood [^46bed03a] [^e2d28356].
- **Emphasizing plant-based proteins**: Encouraging intake of vegetables, legumes, nuts, and low-fat dairy products [^c464c1d3] [^e2d28356].
- **Weight management**: Weight loss for overweight or obese individuals to reduce uric acid levels and flare risk [^7b9c3ac8] [^39bdacdb].
- **Alcohol and fructose restriction**: Limiting alcohol, particularly beer, and avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages with high-fructose corn syrup [^46bed03a] [^c1afd153].

These recommendations reflect a shift toward **holistic dietary patterns** that address both uric acid metabolism and cardiometabolic comorbidities commonly associated with gout [^22890e6c].

---

## Evidence on protein intake and serum uric acid levels

Recent research has clarified the relationship between protein intake and serum uric acid levels:

- **Plant-based proteins**: Diets emphasizing plant-based proteins, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, have been shown to lower serum uric acid levels and reduce the risk of gout flares [^9f3a4ff5] [^a532beee].
- **Low-fat dairy proteins**: Consumption of low-fat dairy products is associated with lower serum uric acid levels and a reduced risk of gout [^c464c1d3] [^e2d28356].
- **Animal proteins**: While high intake of red meat and certain seafood is associated with increased uric acid levels, moderate consumption of lean animal proteins does not significantly elevate uric acid levels in most individuals [^e2d28356] [^39326392].

These findings indicate that **protein intake per se is not detrimental** to gout management; rather, the source and quality of protein are the critical factors [^9511edcc].

---

## Potential risks of low-protein diets

Adopting a low-protein diet for gout management may pose **several risks**:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Inadequate protein intake can lead to deficiencies in essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, compromising overall health [^notfound].
- **Muscle loss**: Low-protein diets can result in muscle wasting, particularly in older adults, reducing physical function and quality of life.
- **Increased carbohydrate intake**: Replacing protein with carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates, can exacerbate insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, indirectly increasing uric acid levels [^22890e6c].

Given these risks, **low-protein diets are not recommended** for gout management unless there is a specific medical indication, such as advanced chronic kidney disease, where protein restriction is warranted for renal reasons rather than gout per se [^notfound].

---

## Role of urate-lowering therapy (ULT)

Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) remains the cornerstone of gout management, particularly for patients with frequent flares, tophi, or chronic kidney disease. ULT, such as allopurinol or febuxostat, effectively reduces serum uric acid levels and prevents gout flares [^d44e3f77]. Dietary modifications, including protein intake, should be viewed as **adjunctive measures** that complement, rather than replace, ULT [^d5f932ff].

---

## Practical dietary recommendations for gout management

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **practical dietary recommendations** are advised for individuals with gout:

| **Dietary component** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Protein intake | - Moderate intake (about 1.2–1.5 g/kg body weight/day) <br/> - Emphasize plant-based proteins (legumes, nuts, seeds) and low-fat dairy products [^c464c1d3] [^e2d28356] |
| Animal protein | - Limit red meat, organ meats, and high-purine seafood (e.g. anchovies, sardines, mussels) [^e2d28356] [^4fce9700] |
| Alcohol | - Limit intake, especially beer and spirits [^46bed03a] [^379bb183] |
| Fructose | - Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in high-fructose corn syrup [^46bed03a] [^c1afd153] |
| Weight management | - Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight through caloric restriction and regular physical activity [^7b9c3ac8] [^39bdacdb] |
| Hydration | - Maintain adequate fluid intake (about 2–3 liters/day) to promote uric acid excretion [^819a554f] |

---

## Conclusion

In summary, **a low-protein diet is not necessary or recommended** for gout management. Current evidence and guidelines emphasize a balanced dietary pattern that includes moderate protein intake, with an emphasis on plant-based proteins and low-fat dairy products, alongside weight management, alcohol moderation, and pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy when indicated. Low-protein diets may pose nutritional risks and are not supported by contemporary clinical evidence for gout management.

### The role of diet in hyperuricemia and gout [^22890e6c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout's cardinal feature is inflammatory arthritis, it is closely associated with insulin resistance and considered a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. As such, both gout and hyperuricemia are often associated with major cardiometabolic and renal comorbidities that drive the persistently elevated premature mortality rates among gout patients. To that end, conventional low-purine (i.e., low-protein) dietary advice given to many patients with gout warrant reconsideration.

Recent Findings

Recent research suggests that several healthy diets, such as the Mediterranean or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, in combination with weight loss for those who are overweight or obese, can drastically improve cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes. By treating gout as a part of the metabolic syndrome and shifting our dietary recommendations to these healthy dietary patterns, the beneficial effects on gout endpoints should naturally follow for the majority of typical gout cases, mediated through changes in insulin resistance.

Summary

Dietary recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia and gout should be approached holistically, taking into consideration its associated cardiometabolic comorbidities. Several healthy dietary patterns, many with similar themes, can be tailored to suit comorbidity profiles and personal preferences.

### Gout: can management be improved? [^1501f8e5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ongoing reviews of Cochrane collaboration show that there is still very little reliable information based on randomized controlled trials on which to base treatment decisions in acute and chronic gout. Recent studies have stressed that avoidance of factors contributing to development of gouty attacks such as diuretic therapy, weight gain, and alcohol consumption may lead to a decrease in gouty arthritis. Attention to minidose aspirin and its effect on serum uric acid levels was addressed. A low carbohydrate, high protein and unsaturated fat diet was recommended for gouty patients since they all enhance insulin sensitivity and therefore may promote a reduction in serum uric acid levels. Treatment of gout in transplant recipients brings into focus some of the issues regarding management of gout, because gout is a common problem among transplant patients.

### Effects of dietary macronutrients on serum urate: results from the omniHeart trial [^9f3a4ff5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary recommendations to prevent gout emphasize a low-purine diet. Recent evidence suggests that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduces serum urate while also improving blood pressure and lipids.

Objective

To compare the effects of DASH-style diets emphasizing different macronutrient proportions on serum urate reduction.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease feeding study, a 3-period, crossover design, randomized trial of adults with prehypertension or hypertension. Participants were provided with 3 DASH-style diets in random order, each for 6 wk. Each DASH-style diet emphasized different macronutrient proportions: a carbohydrate-rich (CARB) diet, a protein-rich (PROT) diet, and an unsaturated fat-rich (UNSAT) diet. In the PROT diet, approximately half of the protein came from plant sources. We compared the effects of these diets on serum urate at weeks 4 and 6 of each feeding period.

Results

Of the 163 individuals included in the final analysis, the mean serum urate at baseline was 5.1 mg/dL. Only the PROT diet reduced serum urate from baseline at the end of the 6-wk feeding period (-0.16 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.04; P = 0.007). Neither the CARB diet (-0.03 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.09; P = 0.66) nor the UNSAT diet (-0.01 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.12, 0.09; P = 0.78) reduced serum urate from baseline. The PROT diet lowered serum urate by 0.12 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.20, -0.03; P = 0.006) compared with CARB and by 0.12 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.20, -0.05; P = 0.002) compared with UNSAT.

Conclusions

A DASH-style diet emphasizing plant-based protein lowered serum urate compared with those emphasizing carbohydrates or unsaturated fat. Future trials should test the ability of a DASH-style diet emphasizing plant-based protein to lower serum urate and prevent gout flares in patients with gout. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00051350.

### Update on importance of diet in gout [^66cd1ecd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within synovial joints. Although it is most well-known for its arthritis, gout has an intimate relationship with many other cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. Current recommendations support aggressive medical therapy to treat gout, whereas dietary counseling has become less emphasized. This article argues for the absolute importance of dietary counseling in gout and proves why this counseling may impact the long term well-being of a patient with gout.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^d9392cc3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute gout arthritis flares contribute dominantly to gout-specific impaired health-related quality of life, representing a progressively increasing public health problem. Flares can be complex and expensive to treat, partly due to the frequent comorbidities. Unmet needs in gout management are more pressing given the markedly increasing gout flare hospital admission rates. In addition, chronic gouty arthritis can cause joint damage and functional impairment. This review addresses new knowledge on the basis for the marked, inherent variability of responses to deposited urate crystals, including the unpredictable and self-limited aspects of many gout flares. Specific topics reviewed include how innate immunity and two-signal inflammasome activation intersect with diet, metabolism, nutritional biosensing, the microbiome, and the phagocyte cytoskeleton and cell fate. The paper discusses the roles of endogenous constitutive regulators of inflammation, including certain nutritional biosensors, and emerging genetic and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in the basis of variability in responses to urate crystals in gout provide information about inflammatory arthritis, and have identified potential new targets and strategies for anti-inflammatory prevention and treatment of gouty arthritis.

### The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, Western diet, and risk of gout in men: prospective cohort study [^cdde95d5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and is caused by hyperuricemia. The prevalence of gout has increased over several decades among adults in the UK and USA to 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively. This disease burden is further complicated by a high level of cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities(eg, hypertension in 74%of patients and metabolic syndrome in 63%) and their sequelae (eg, an increased future risk of myocardial infarctionand premature death). The conventional approach of a diet low in purine for gout care offers limited efficacy, palatability, and sustainability. This low protein diet promotes increased consumption of refined carbohydrates (including fructose) and unhealthy fats (including trans fats) that can actually worsen cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities by furthering insulin resistance and increasing levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, there is a key unmet need for an effective dietary strategy to address both the morbidity burden of gout and its associated cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities.

There are proved effective dietary approaches for cardiovascular metabolic conditions that could also lower serum uric acid levels. For example, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet substantially reduces blood pressure and is recommended for preventing cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet emphasizes intake of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy foods, and reduced saturated and total fat. Furthermore, a recent ancillary analysis of an original DASH randomized trial found that the DASH diet lowers serum uric acid levels substantially among people with hyperuricemia compared with a typical American diet. Thus, the DASH diet may be particularly useful in gout care by reducing both serum uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease risk. This is especially relevant to patients with hypertension, a common comorbidity of gout; however, corresponding data for the risk of gout are not available. Conversely, the Western diet (reflecting higher intake of red and processed meats, beverages sweetened with sugar, sweets, desserts, French fries, and refined grains) contains many foods that have previously been established to increase serum uric acid levels and the risk of gout, which may explain the increasing prevalence of gout in Western countries. However, no direct data linking the Western diet with the risk of gout are available.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^25f55c58]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^b44b6c42]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Carbohydrate-restricted hypocaloric diet — effects, indications, and monitoring are described: A carbohydrate-restricted hypocaloric diet may produce modestly greater weight reduction compared to fat-restricted dietary intake, at least for the first 6 months, and after 6 months the weight reduction may be similar to other calorie-restricted nutritional interventions. Carbohydrate-restricted hypocaloric diets may reduce fasting glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels, and modestly increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as modestly reduce blood pressure, and some of these metabolic effects may occur with or without weight reduction. A low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may improve diabetes mellitus complications (i.e., nephropathy); in patients with epilepsy, a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) may reduce seizures; and LCKD may help increase energy expenditure during maintenance of weight reduction. Early implementation is sometimes associated with malaise and may produce carbohydrate cravings within the first few days of implementation which may be mitigated by adding low-glycemic-index carbohydrate foods; a carbohydrate-restricted diet may induce gout in patients with a history of gout and may present challenges when dietary protein restriction is recommended (i.e., severe kidney disease). Due to the possibility of hypoglycemia and hypotension in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension respectively, blood sugar and blood pressure should be monitored for potential adjustment in applicable metabolic drug treatments.

### Nutritional recommendations for gout: an update from clinical epidemiology [^a3b2603c]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the evidence for nutritional lifestyle changes recommended for gout patients; an explicit focus will be on the evidence for weight loss in overweight gout patients based on a recent systematic review and to describe methodological details for an upcoming weight loss trial.

Methods

We did a pragmatic but systematic search in MEDLINE for current guidelines that had made an attempt to make nutritional recommendations for gout. The quality of the evidence for the nutritional recommendations was evaluated based on the guidelines' own ratings and converted into a common simple version based on the GRADE system. The recently published systematic review on weight loss for gout, was based on six databases from which longitudinal studies that had quantified the effects following weight loss were included. The internal validity was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool and the quality of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. Based on the results of the systematic review, a trial was designed, adhering to the principles of evidence based research.

Results

We included 17 guidelines. Most guidelines recommend avoiding or limiting alcohol intake (15; i.e. 88%), lose weight if relevant (12; 71%), and reduce fructose intake (11; 65%). The majority of the evidence for the nutritional recommendations was rated Moderate/Low or Very Low quality. Our recent systematic review on weight loss included 10 studies and found that the available evidence indicates beneficial effects of weight loss for overweight and obese gout patients, but the evidence is of low to moderate quality. As a consequence, researchers from the Parker Institute are launching a randomized trial to explore the short-term effects related to a diet-induced weight loss in obese gout patients.

Conclusions

The nutritional recommendations for gout are generally based on low quality evidence. In terms of weight loss as a management strategy, the available evidence is in favor of weight loss for overweight/obese gout patients. However, since the current evidence consists of only a few studies (mostly observational) of low methodological quality, the Parker Institute are now initiating a rigorous exploratory randomized trial. Similar efforts are needed for other nutritional management strategies for gout.

### The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, Western diet, and risk of gout in men: prospective cohort study [^e652ca82]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Our findings also have practical implications for the prevention of gout. While individual dietary risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout have been identified, a piecemeal approach to modifying the various, yet limited, number of specific dietary risk factors is often ineffective and impractical. For example, focusing exclusively on reducing protein content in the conventional diet low in purine often provides an incomplete dietary recommendation without considering the proper replacement with healthy calorie sources, which in turn could actually worsen the metabolic syndrome and its consequences, which include hyperuricemia and gout. In contrast, a healthful complete dietary pattern approach such as the DASH diet reflects the way foods are consumed in reality and can facilitate the dissemination and adoption (by providing comprehensive diet instructions and ongoing support) in both public health and clinical practice. Moreover, unlike the conventional low purine approach, another important advantage of the DASH diet is its palatability, which is important for sustainability. For example, a post hoc survey of a DASH trial found that participants enjoyed the DASH diet and were willing to continue with it more than the control diet.

In contrast, we found that the Western diet was independently associated with an increased risk of gout. This provides the first prospective evidence that the Western diet, reflecting fast foods abundantly available in Western countries, can explain the increasing prevalence of gout observed in such settings. Increased purine intake from animal sources and insulin resistance resulting in anti-uricosuric effects are likely mechanisms of this diet leading to hyperuricemia and eventually gout. Replacing the Western diet with a healthful eating approach such as the DASH diet could help prevent the rising burden of gout, in addition to other expected public health benefits (eg, hypertension benefits).

### Weight loss for patients with gout and concomitant obesity: a proof-of-concept randomized trial [^b47e85ca]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite scarce evidence, guidelines recommend weight loss as a management strategy for patients with gout. We investigated the effect of an intensive dietary intervention on body weight and clinical measures of gout severity in individuals with obesity and gout.

Methods

We conducted a 16-week randomized nonmasked parallel-group trial in Denmark, randomly assigning (one-to-one) individuals with obesity and gout to a low-energy diet or a control diet. The primary outcome was change in body weight. Key secondary outcomes were changes in serum urate (SU) level and visual analog scale-assessed pain and fatigue.

Results

Between December 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019, 61 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population and randomly assigned to the intensive diet group (n = 29) or control diet group (n = 32). Participants had a mean age of 60.3 (SD 9.9) years and mean body mass index of 35.6 (SD 5.0), and 59 (97%) were men. After 16weeks, there was a significant difference in change in body weight between the diet and control groups (-15.4 vs -7.7 kg; difference -7.7 kg [95% confidence interval -10.7 to -4.7], P < 0.001). Despite results being potentially in favor of a low-energy diet, we could not confirm differences in SU level changes and fatigue between groups. No differences in pain and gout flares were observed between groups. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the trial.

Conclusion

An intensive dietary intervention was safe and effectively lowered body weight in people with obesity and gout, but the weight loss did not directly translate into effects on SU level, fatigue, and pain.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^39326392]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

First, physicians and patients need to update their knowledge regarding the dietary and lifestyle risk factors for gout in order to take advantage of these windows of opportunities. New information from well-designed epidemiological studies is available, which update our knowledge of the disease (based on clinical anecdotes) and confirm or refute previous prevalent beliefs about gout. Higher intake of meats, seafood, alcohol (in particular beer) and sugar-sweetened soft drinks (including fruit juices and sodas) increase the risk of gout, while low fat dairy products, Vitamin C supplements and coffee decrease the risk of gout (Figure 8). Importantly, purine-rich vegetables and nuts do not increase the risk of incident gout. A higher intake of purine-rich foods from animal sources (meats etc.) and alcohol increases the risk of gout flares. Since environmental factors play a big role in the risk of gout as well as risk of gout flares, they should be one of the main foci of gout management. Our recent work with patients shows that they are interested in discussing these options with their providers as part of their gout management. Physicians can counsel patients during their regular follow-up regarding strategies to prevent gout and in those with gout, ways to decrease the risk and suffering from gout flares. Therefore, this is one key area of opportunity for both physicians and patients.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: a scoping review [^5ba70a81]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Beliefs about necessity of self‐management to improve gout‐related health

Patients adhered to ULT when they felt the need to prevent or reduce disease symptoms (eg, to prevent flares and associated pain). Other reasons to adhere to ULT included the prevention of disease progression; disability; surgery; avoiding additional hospital visits; improving quality of life, mobility, and daily functioning; and being able to care for others and not having to change their diet. For the latter, some patients elaborated that lifestyle modification was difficult to adhere to in the long run. On the contrary, the identification of dietary triggers for gout and the subsequent belief that gout could be prevented through diet acted as a barrier to receiving ULT. Additional barriers to receiving ULT included preferences for alternative medicine, perception that other medication is more effective, and only receiving ULT when sUA levels increase. Some patients preferred to treat flares only receiving short‐term treatment instead of long‐term ULT, if flare frequency was acceptable to them. After quitting, patients were motivated to restart receiving ULT when recently experiencing a recurrent flare. Regarding lifestyle, patients adjusted their diet by either consuming foods they believed to be beneficial or avoiding foods believed to be detrimental to alleviate symptoms and reduce (the frequency of) flares. Patients generally believed that changing dietary habits and being physically active were necessary to reduce sUA levels. Limitations in daily activities and the desire to accomplish life plans were also motivators for lifestyle modification.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Recent developments in diet and gout [^7ea23e25]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in men, affecting approximately 1–2% of adult men in Western countries. United States gout prevalence has approximately doubled over the past two decades. In recent years, key prospective epidemiological and open-labeled dietary studies, coupled with recent advances in molecular biology elucidating proximal tubular urate transport, have provided novel insights into roles of diet and alcohol in hyperuricemia and gout. This review focuses on recent developments and their implications for clinical practice, including how we advise patients on appropriate diets and alcoholic beverage consumption.

Recent Findings

Studies have observed an increased risk of gout among those who consumed the highest quintile of meat, seafood and alcohol. Although limited by confounding variables, low-fat dairy products, ascorbic acid and wine consumption appeared to be protective for the development of gout.

Summary

The most effective forms of dietary regimen for both hyperuricemia and gout flares remains to be unidentified. Until confirmed by a large, controlled study, it is prudent to advise patients to consume meat, seafood and alcoholic beverages in moderation, with special attention to food portion size and content of non-complex carbohydrates which are essential for weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity.

Newer approaches to the treatment of gout have included modifications and further attention to aspects of current therapies, and development of interesting new therapies. Colchicine prophylaxis appears to be needed longer than previously recognized after introduction of a urate-lowering agent. Diet has received attention, though most dietary effects are small. New agents under investigation include pegylated formulations of uricase and a new potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat. Some cardiovascular drugs have been shown to be uricosuric.

Conversely, women with highest-quintile Western diet score had 49% higher risk of gout. When combined, the most DASH-diet adherent women with normal body mass index had a 68% lower risk of gout compared with the least adherent women with overweight or obese BMI; the corresponding risk reduction was 65% combining high DASH diet adherence with no diuretic use. The 4 healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a lower risk of incident gout, as summarized in Table 2. Numerically, the risk reduction was greatest with the DASH dietary pattern, with a 32% reduced risk of incident gout in the most adherent quintile compared with the least adherent.

C-reactive protein and E-selectin, whereas the Prudent pattern was inversely associated, even after adjusting for BMI, a potential causal intermediate. 63 Similarly, the AHEI and Mediterranean diet scores were inversely associated with these markers of systemic inflammation in women in the NHS, along with interleukin-6, 64 a key cytokine in gouty inflammation. These potential dual benefits contrast with the low-purine diet individuals with hyperuricemia or gout have traditionally been encouraged to follow, 28 which carries limited efficacy and an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile by indiscriminately replacing protein with carbohydrates and fat, which the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines discourage.

17 Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the isocaloric DASH diets, as well as Mediterranean or other weight loss diets can lower serum urate levels25, 26, 29; consumption of individual food items, 39, 41, 65 and adherence to the DASH and Western dietary patterns, 30 have been associated with the risk of clinical gout, even after adjusting for BMI, but these exposures were studied primarily among men. Several cross-sectional analyses also reported consistent associations with serum urate levels or odds of hyperuricemia, independent of obesity. 32, 66–68.

### Making the right thing the easy thing to do: strategies to improve outcomes in gout [^d3f8f19a]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The burden of gout is increasing worldwide. Although urate-lower ing drugs have been available for more than half a century, the initiation and persistence of urate-lowering therapy remain low. Health-care system, practitioner, and patient barriers contribute to the clinical inertia in gout management. Pervasive beliefs about gout as a disease of an indulgent lifestyle that should be managed primarily with dietary modification are key barriers that prevent patients from receiving effective therapy. In light of safety concerns about newer urate-lowering medications, allopurinol, an inexpensive generic medication, is likely to remain the first-line urate-lowering therapy for the foreseeable future. Ensuring that allopurinol is optimally and persistently prescribed is a priority for improved gout management. A health literacy approach that focuses on patient understanding of gout as a chronic disease that requires behaviour change to take long term urate-lowering therapy is important. This approach provides a clear rationale for long-term urate-lowering therapy that is able to dissolve the monosodium urate crystals and ultimately prevent the symptoms of gout. Patient-centred models that use the skills of nurses and pharmacists to facilitate patient understanding can lead to major improvements in gout care. Additionally, systematic quality improvement approaches within practices, while reducing inconvenience and cost to patients, should be a priority.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^bd33696f]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

### Effects of low-fat, mediterranean, or low-carbohydrate weight loss diets on serum urate and cardiometabolic risk factors: a secondary analysis of the dietary intervention randomized controlled trial (DIRECT) [^39bdacdb]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Weight loss diets may reduce serum urate (SU) by lowering insulin resistance while providing cardiometabolic benefits, something urate-lowering drugs have not shown in trials. We aimed to examine the effects of weight loss diets on SU and cardiometabolic risk factors.

Research Design and Methods

This secondary study of the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) used stored samples from 235 participants with moderate obesity randomly assigned to low-fat, restricted-calorie (n = 85); Mediterranean, restricted-calorie (n = 76); or low-carbohydrate, non-restricted-calorie (n = 74) diets. We examined SU changes at 6 and 24 months overall and among those with hyperuricemia (SU ≥ 416 μmol/L), a relevant subgroup at risk for gout.

Results

Among all participants, average SU decreases were 48 μmol/L at 6 months and 18 μmol/L at 24 months, with no differences between diets (P > 0.05). Body weight, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol:HDL-C ratio, triglycerides, and insulin concentrations also improved in all three groups (P < 0.05 at 6 months). Adjusting for covariates, changes in weight and fasting plasma insulin concentrations remained associated with SU changes (P < 0.05). SU reductions among those with hyperuricemia were 113, 119, and 143 μmol/L at 6 months for low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate diets (all P for within-group comparison < 0.001; P > 0.05 for between-group comparisons) and 65, 77, and 83 μmol/L, respectively, at 24 months (all P for within-group comparison < 0.01; P > 0.05 for between-group comparisons).

Conclusions

Nonpurine-focused weight loss diets may simultaneously improve SU and cardiovascular risk factors likely mediated by reducing adiposity and insulin resistance. These dietary options could provide personalized pathways to suit patient comorbidity and preferences for adherence.

### Low-calorie, high-protein diets, regardless of protein source, improve glucose metabolism and cardiometabolic profiles in subjects with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity [^041fa4e4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When HP diets are prescribed, there are concerns about their possible nephrotoxicity or detrimental effects on glucose and other cardiometabolic parameters, which would be especially concerning in subjects with T2DM. It has been hypothesized that the consumption of large quantities of protein could lead to mTORC1 hyperactivation and increase insulin resistance in the mid‐ or long term. Our results contradict this hypothesis and demonstrate that insulin resistance improved in people with prediabetes and T2DM following a hypocaloric HP diet. In addition, we did not note any worsening of renal function. Further, microalbuminuria decreased in both diet groups, an effect that is associated with better renal function and less morbimortality in T2DM. Some researchers postulate that uric acid levels could increase when following a long‐term HP diet, especially in men. In our study, uric acid concentrations improved significantly in both groups.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^0e821a33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

Recommendation

ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^7bd401b0]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Reasons for poor outcomes in people with CKD and gout.

This schematic provides a conceptual framework to explain poor management and outcomes in people with gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD). No good-quality evidence is available to guide treatment decisions because clinical trials have traditionally excluded participants with advanced CKD or, when these participants are enrolled, the trials have failed to report outcomes stratified by renal function. In addition, comparing and contrasting studies is difficult because of variability in reporting of outcomes for both urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and gout flare studies (this problem is not unique to gout in the context of CKD). In addition, many health-care team members involved in the management of people with gout and CKD have valid concerns about confusing guidance (conflicting recommendations among treatment guidelines from prominent societies), and harbour misconceptions (including that ULTs will have an adverse effect on renal function (and the ULT dose should therefore be adjusted), the risk of adverse effects (mainly allopurinol hypersensitivity) and that ULT will have reduced efficacy). These factors lead to excessively conservative approaches to the treatment of gout in people with CKD, which often does not achieve optimal treatment outcomes.

This Consensus Statement from G-CAN aims to discuss the evidence (or lack of) for the management of gout in people with CKD and to identify key research questions that will address challenges faced in managing gout and CKD. We focus on CKD stages 3–5 (Table 1), for which there remain the most debate and concern about appropriate therapy for coexistent gout. This Consensus Statement is not intended as a guideline for the management of gout in CKD; rather, it analyses the available literature on the safety and efficacy of drugs used in gout management to identify important gaps in knowledge and associated areas for research. We do not analyse the role of ULT in people with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and CKD, as treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia with ULT is not currently recommended or approved in most areas of the world. We do not consider non-pharmacological interventions for gout in CKD, such as dietary interventions or weight loss. Finally, this Consensus Statement does not discuss the particularly complex management and frequently severe clinical course of patients with hyperuricaemia and gout after transplantation of a kidney or other major organ.

### Why better treatment of gout is needed [^b56854e7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of gout is thought to be simple, but in reality we are confronted regularly with patients who do not adhere to treatment and patients who have other medical conditions that render the choice of therapy difficult. A treat-to-target approach is essential in order to manage hyperuricaemia effectively and this, combined with a better use of existing treatments, offers the best way forward.

### The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, Western diet, and risk of gout in men: prospective cohort study [^a532beee]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort study, we found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a lower risk of incident gout. In contrast, the Western diet was associated with an increased risk of incident gout. These associations were independent of risk factors for gout such as age, body mass index, hypertension, renal failure, diuretic use, alcohol intake, and coffee intake, and did not differ by body mass index, alcohol intake, and hypertension status. These data suggest that the DASH diet could offer an attractive dietary strategy that would be useful in the prevention of gout and its comorbidities in high risk patients with hyperuricemia. If confirmed by future intervention trials, this approach would be particularly relevant to patients with gout who have hypertension and cardiovascular disease, given its antihypertensive and cardiovascular disease benefits.

The main components of the DASH diet include fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low fat dairy products, and whole grains, combined with a low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats. This pattern substantially overlaps with previous study findings of individual dietary risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout such as meat, seafood, alcohol, fructose-rich beverages, as well as protective (or neutral) factors such as low fat dairy intake, vegetables, cherries, legumes, nuts, and plant protein. This explains why the dietary pattern is associated with a lower risk of gout in a dose-responsive manner. Reduced purine loading and insulin resistance, as well as the resulting uricosuric effects, have been thought to be potential mechanisms behind anti-gout foods leading to lower serum uric acid levels. Indeed, a recent ancillary analysis (n = 103) of a DASH diet trialfound that the DASH diet lowers serum uric acid levels compared with a typical American diet (ie, control diet), particularly among those with hyperuricemia (ie, by 1.0 mg/dL in those with a baseline serum uric acid level ≥ 6 mg/dL and by 1.3 mg/dL in those with a baseline serum uric acid ≥ 7 mg/dL). These findings collectively suggest that the DASH diet's ability to lower uric acid levels can be translated to a lower risk of developing gout.

Introduction

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, affecting approximately 4% of US adults, and is associated with an increased comorbidity burden, premature mortality, and negative mental health outcomes. Several dietary factors are associated with the risk of gout. Alcohol, red meat, fish, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)are all positively associated with gout, while low-fat dairy products, coffee, and vitamin Chave shown inverse associations. Moreover, despite the moderate purine load of certain vegetables and legumes, they do not necessarily promote gout. While the contributions of selected individual food and beverage items (and nutrients) to gout risk are generally well characterized, these data are challenging to translate into dietary practices for gout prevention because foods are not eaten in isolation. Moreover, some foods that are positively associated with gout are simultaneously inversely associated with other cardiometabolic diseases (eg, fish). Therefore, it is not surprising that conventional purine-focused dietary advice for gout has confused patients.

Dietary patterns better reflect how foods are consumed together, which may facilitate implementation of healthy eating patterns. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet lowers serum urate, and is consistently inversely associated with gout in observational studies. A secondary analysis of the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial found that a Mediterranean-style diet also lowered serum urateand was also inversely associated with gout. Although these dietary patterns share an emphasis on several healthy plant foods, plant-based diets that specifically deemphasize all animal products have received less attention. Such a diet is particularly timely, as the food system is inextricably linked with environmental sustainabilityand consuming a plant-based diet is a key measure to reduce growing environmental pressures as well as improve planetary health alongside human health. However, the limited prior studies of gout simply dichotomized plant-based diets as vegetarian vs meat-containing and did not differentiate between the quality of plant foods. For example, while SSBs are technically of plant origin, their nutrient profile is poor. Therefore, we examined the associations of an overall plant-based diet, as well as healthy and unhealthy versions of this diet, with the risk of incident gout in 2 large prospective cohorts of US men and women.

### Estimation of primary prevention of gout in men through modification of obesity and other key lifestyle factors [^ebe1b3f9]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Definition of Low-Risk Groups

As detailed in the eMethods in the Supplement, we focused on 4 common modifiable factors accepted as associated with the risk of gout (ie, obesity, alcohol, diet, and diuretic use). The criteria used to define a low-risk group according to levels of each risk factor were similar to those used in previous analyses of end points related to gout, such as myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The low-risk group for adiposity was primarily defined as BMI less than 25, as has been done previously. We additionally performed sensitivity analyses defining the low-risk group as BMI less than 23 and 27. The low-risk group for alcohol was defined as no use in our primary analysis, and consumption up to 10 g per day in a sensitivity analysis.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an established dietary pattern shown in multiple randomized trials to substantially reduce blood pressure. The DASH diet discourages purine-rich red meat as well as fructose-rich foods, while promoting consumption of low-fat dairy products, healthy protein sources, and vegetables/fruits, all of which are individually associated with a lower risk of developing incident gout. Calculation of the DASH-style diet score from the FFQ has been described in detail elsewhere. We considered participants to be at low risk for incident gout if they had a DASH-style diet score in the highest quintile of the cohort, as done previously for hypertension. We defined the low-risk group for diuretics as no use.

Ascertainment of Incident Gout

On each biennial questionnaire, participants indicated whether they had received a diagnosis of gout from a physician. We mailed a supplementary questionnaire to those reporting new cases of gout diagnosed from 1986 onward to confirm the report, according to the preliminary American College of Rheumatology survey criteria for gout, and ascertain the date of gout onset.

A further limitation is the use of high BMI and kidney dysfunction as the only risk factors. These were the only risk factors that had sufficient population-based evidence of a causal relationship with gout as required for GBD studies. Other risk factors for hyperuricaemia, which increases the risk of gout, include fasting plasma glucose, genetics, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and dietary factors including purine-rich foods such as red meat and seafood intake in addition to the consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages. Current GBD methods for other conditions such as cardiovascular disease include a diet high in red meat and processed meat in addition to alcohol consumption as risk factors; however, the causal evidence for gout due to these risks has not yet been evaluated for inclusion in future iterations of GBD.

In conclusion, the burden of gout increased globally over the past 30 years and is forecast to continue increasing over the next three decades. It is important to note that all regions had an increase in rates of the age-standardised burden due to gout from 1990 to 2020, despite large regional variations. Our findings highlight the need to focus on the prevention and management of gout as the population ages, especially among males. Preventing the disease requires public policy interventions to control risk factors, in particular high BMI, and guide resource allocation to enable early diagnosis and access and adherence to treatment.

### Lifestyle interventions for chronic gout [^f07106ea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although lifestyle interventions are commonly recommended in the management of patients with chronic gout, the evidence from trial data for their benefits and safety has not been previously examined in a systematic review.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the benefits and safety of lifestyle interventions for the treatment of people with chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies on 5 April 2013. We also searched the 2010 to 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of the reference lists of included articles.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) which compared lifestyle interventions to another therapy (active or placebo) in patients with chronic gout. Outcomes of interest were changes in gout attack frequency, joint pain, serum urate levels, tophus size, function, quality of life and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration for the selection, appraisal, data collection and synthesis of studies. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Only one study (120 participants), at moderate risk of bias, was included in the review. Patients were randomised to one of three interventions: either skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600, non-enriched SMP or lactose powder, over a three-month period. The frequency of acute gout attacks, measured as the number of flares per month, decreased in all three groups over the three-month study period. Low quality evidence indicated that there was no difference between the SMP/GMP/G600 group and combined control groups (SMP and lactose powder) at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.76 to 0.34). There were no significant between-group differences in terms of withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.03), and serious adverse events resulting in hospitalisation (2/40 SMP/GMP/G600 group versus 3/80 controls; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.66). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were the most commonly reported. Pain from self reported gout flares, measured on a 10-point Likert scale, improved more in the SMP/GMP/G600 group compared to controls (MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.10), an absolute difference of 10% (absolute risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.01). This is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Physical function, tophus regression and serum urate normalisation were not reported in this study.

Authors' Conclusions

While there is good evidence from observational studies of an association between various lifestyle risk factors and gout development, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials to either support or refute the use of lifestyle modifications for improving outcomes in people with chronic gout.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^26d11285]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Multiple recent discoveries have revealed that urate crystals form at a variety of unexpected sites, but without clear inflammatory sequelae. Work in the last few years has elucidated factors involved in the marked, inherent variability of responses to urate crystals and onset, extent, and duration of flares of acute gouty inflammation. Knowledge of how innate immunity intersects with diet, metabolism, the microbiome, genetics and epigenetics, and phagocyte fate in shaping inflammatory responses to urate crystal deposits in gout provides valuable lessons about inflammation, as well as potential new biomarkers and targets for therapy in gout.

Despite many effective treatments for gout, its management remains a challenge internationally. Options for optimizing gout management may differ in different practice sizes and settings. Gout incidence is rising and it continues to be associated with increased mortality. Education of patients and medical providers is essential, and newer gout medications need to be used in the most appropriate ways for cost-effective therapy. Special consideration needs to be given to such populations as the elderly and those with renal and cardiovascular disease in gout management. New agents are in development, which may add to the armamentarium for gout management.

### Protein-controlled versus restricted protein versus low protein diets in managing patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease: a single centre experience in Australia [^e4f77cc9]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Current practices

In our centre, renal dietitians receive referrals from nephrologists, either directly or through "blanket referral" in the multidisciplinary pre-dialysis assessment and renal supportive care clinics. Patients receive intervention within the framework of the nutrition care process (NCP), namely structured care including assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation; as well as dietary prescription and frequency and duration of intervention as recommended by the clinical and work practice guidelines summarised into the agreed local protocols. Table 1 summaries the nutrition management protocols for CKD (non-dialysis) stage 4–5. These protocols are regularly updated with agreements sought from the renal team during the review process.

"Low protein diet" has not been well accepted by the Australian nephrology community, as there is no high-level evidence to support such practice. Many clinicians perceive a "low protein diet" or "restricted protein diet" as restrictive and leading to treatment burden and malnutrition. With these beliefs, a "free diet" is often thought to help improve nutrition status and quality of life. Unfortunately, it doesn't guarantee appropriate and adequate intake, or good nutritional status. Problems can range from very poor spontaneous intake due to uraemia, or on the other hand, excessive habitual protein intake leads to uraemic toxin build-up and exacerbates symptoms. In addition, protein foods are naturally high in acids, purine, phosphorous and potassium. Therefore, uncontrolled protein food intake may also lead to other complications such as greater acid load, hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalaemia. The national dietary survey reported that the habitual protein intake of the average Australian adult is almost twice the RDI level of 0.75 g/kg/d. Patients often fail to recognise symptoms and the gradual reduction of food intake leads to deteriorating nutritional status. These nutritional problems surfaced during the period of decline in referral for nutrition intervention in non-dialysis CKD stages.

Hyperkalemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and gout in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — research priorities include evaluating strategies to address and prevent hyperkalemia with patient-centered and utilization outcomes, assessing low-potassium diets on serum potassium, mortality, and QoL, and conducting large randomized controlled trials of potassium exchange agents on clinical outcomes. Additional priorities are to determine the value of uric acid–lowering therapies on CKD and CVD outcomes, define dietary modifications that reduce serum uric acid and gout risk, and clarify the safety and efficacy of symptomatic treatments for acute gout (including a short course of NSAIDs). Cardiovascular prevention needs include evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PCSK-9 inhibitors versus statins, testing antiplatelet agents such as low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in large RCTs, developing CKD-specific risk and bleeding assessment tools, identifying which patients benefit from invasive management of ischemic heart disease versus maximal medical therapy, and creating new thromboprophylaxis risk scores incorporating CKD-specific predictors.

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis triggered by the crystallization of uric acid within the joints. Gout affects millions worldwide and has an increasing prevalence. Recent research has been carried out to better qualify and quantify the risk factors predisposing individuals to gout. These can largely be broken into nonmodifiable risk factors, such as gender, age, race, and genetics, and modifiable risk factors, such as diet and lifestyle. Increasing knowledge of factors predisposing certain individuals to gout could potentially lead to improved preventive practices. This review summarizes the nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors associated with development of gout.

### The case for a ketogenic diet in the management of kidney disease [^e79eea25]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Perspectives and future direction

There is a considerable body of research suggesting that a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet is safe in individuals with moderately diminished kidney function, even in studies that had higher protein intake than what is recommended for kidney disease and diets that are not plant-based. The diet can be safely prescribed in patients with T2D for treating and remitting diabetes even if they have underlying stage 2 or 3 CKD or reduced kidney function. Beyond safety, mechanistic plausibility, preclinical data, and even some RCT studies suggest that carbohydrate-restricted diets may be beneficial in improving moderate kidney dysfunction and in reducing progression of CKD. The preliminary proof of concept from small and short duration studies in humans and animals suggests a very low carbohydrate diet could be an effective dietary intervention for patients with CKD. Furthermore, there are predeveloped ketogenic nutritional options to consider when we plan a future trial to assess the impact of ketogenic diet on patients with CKD, such as the recently developed program for treating ADPKD known as Ren. Nu. This program is a plant-focused ketogenic medical nutrition therapy, designed to avoid renal stressors like oxalate, inorganic phosphate, and purines/uric acid. It includes a medical food formulation, KetoCitra, containing BHB with alkaline citrate which helps antagonize kidney stone formation. Based on the findings from these different studies and currently available ketogenic medical therapy specific for kidney disease, there is a need for future larger and longer follow-up randomized controlled clinical trials on very low carbohydrate diet, including nutritional ketosis in patients with CKD with or without T2D on kidney hard endpoints including major adverse kidney events (a composite event of death, persistent renal decline > 25% decline in eGFR, and a new initiation of dialysis) and other kidney-related outcomes to firmly establish the long-term effectiveness. For example, a head-to-head comparison of the safety and efficacy of ketogenic nutritional therapy versus SGLT2i pharmacologic intervention (that involves the same mechanism of raising ketone levels) could be of high interest. Weight loss from the diet can improve filtration and albuminuria. Thus, including other surrogate endpoints like eGFR slope and microalbuminuria in these studies have the potential to elucidate the degree to which weight loss and blood pressure improvement from the diet affects kidney function markers and also to explore if ketone levels independently have an impact on these markers and endpoints. Furthermore, these studies should also assess the diet's overall safety in patients with T2D and CKD, specifically exploring its effect on net acid excretion, kidney stone formation, and maybe its beneficial effect on sodium retention hypertension. Finally, another important consideration in the clinical trial design for evaluating the efficacy of a very low carbohydrate diet in patients with CKD is understanding the diet's additive role, especially how the diet interacts with currently available treatment drugs for patients with CKD including renin–angiotensin system blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEi and angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs), SGLT2i, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), and the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (finerenone).

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^dc5b2130]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Safety and effectiveness of low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease [^055e2960]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, around 80% of diabetic patient needed less insulin doses during LPD, but it is not known how many units were actually reduced; however, data on insulin use are not consistent to support the hypothesis of an improvement of insulin resistance with the LPD-KA. Despite that, the uric acid behaviour during the study allows to speculate on improvement of insulin resistance. After six months of low-protein diet, uric acid levels decreased in all patients with a final level similar between groups; it is plausible that uric acid drop during the short time period might be dependent on the low amount of purines in the LPD-KA diet. On the other hand, in the long term the uric acid markedly decreased in diabetics. Insulin resistance and uric acid are independently linked and there is strong epidemiological evidence that hyperuricemia may be either associated to or even predict the onset of insulin resistance. Formerly, hyperuricemia was considered as a consequence of insulin resistance due to the reduction of urinary uric acid excretion but later it was also suggested uric acid has a contributory causal role in diabetes. Indeed, insulin resistance in models of metabolic syndrome can be improved by lowering serum uric acid. Uric acid also blocks the insulin mediated endothelial nitric oxide release that is critical for insulin action. The evidences of lowering uric acid on insulin resistance in human studies are limited. However, insulin resistance has been reported to be improved by urate lowering therapy; one study reported the improvement of glycated hemoglobin levels in diabetic subjects treated with allopurinol. Therefore, in our CKD diabetic patients the low-protein diet directly lowered the uric acid level and, likely, the lower urea levels obtained with the LPD-KA improved the insulin resistance which further contributed to the lowering of uric acid. Overall, the reduction of uric acid improved the glucose metabolic profile most likely throughout amelioration of insulin resistance.

### Gout in primary care: can we improve patient outcomes? [^c7d6d7e0]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

All patients with gout in primary care should receive treatment in accordance with the NICE guidelines. Each patient should be knowledgable about their condition and understand the importance of medication compliance, diet and lifestyle modifications. Early preventative measures may reduce gout flares, GP attendance and the risk of cardiovascular disease. This GP practice is currently discussing the development of an annual gout clinic. This would give general practitioners and patients opportunity to review their disease management over the previous year, medication compliance, biochemical monitoring and address any outstanding questions. The lead GP for this project is continuing this project with the support from the GP partners, phlebotomists and administrative staff and hopes the results will be sustainable.

### The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, Western diet, and risk of gout in men: prospective cohort study [^435dae5a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The DASH diet has other important health benefits relevant to patients with hyperuricemia or gout, both of which are associated with a high level of cardiovascular metabolic comorbiditiesand mortality. A series of randomized controlled trials found that DASH based diets substantially reduce blood pressure. For example, the original DASH trial found that the DASH diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more than the control diet, respectively. As hypertension is present in 74% of patients with gout (and in 50% of people with hyperuricemia), nearly three out of four patients with gout would already be indicated for the DASH diet to treat their hypertension. Our findings, together with the recently shown urate lowering effect of the DASH diet, suggest that the diet could also help their gout. To that end, the American Heart Association guidelines for cardiovascular health and the dietary management of hypertension endorse foods and dietary approaches that are similar to those included in the DASH diet. Furthermore, the DASH diet has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and kidney stones, all of which are correlates of gout and hyperuricemia. As such, the DASH diet could be useful not only in the prevention of gout and its comorbidities in high risk patients with hyperuricemia, but also when urate lowering drugs are not yet indicated in patients with gout (a more frequently encountered scenario in primary care). Moreover, even when such drugs are indicated, the DASH diet would serve as a useful adjunct therapy to improve the cardiovascular comorbidity profile of the patient. Finally, many patients with gout prefer non-pharmacologic options for treatment, according to a recent survey by the Gout and Uric Acid Education Society. There is also some skepticism about the approach of treating gout with drugs to lower a patient's urate level ("treating to target") raised by the recent American College of Physicians gout guidelines for general physicians. Therefore, our results and further evidence about the efficacy of non-pharmacologic options have become more relevant to gout care.

### Gout [^61d8db04]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of treatments to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, corticotropin (ACTH), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfinpyrazone, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, advice to lose weight, advice to reduce alcohol intake, and advice to reduce dietary intake of purines.

Introduction

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, manifesting as acute flares of severe joint pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in one or more joints, which can progress to chronic destructive arthropathy. The prevalence of gout is higher in males than females, and increases with age. Although a high serum urate concentration is the most important risk factor for the development of gout, genetic factors have a strong influence on the occurrence of gout, and a range of risk factors, such as medications, comorbidities, and environmental exposures, are also implicated. Many factors that contribute to hyperuricaemia are also risk factors for incident gout, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease, factors commonly seen in younger people with gout. Gout has been associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal comorbidities.

Effective management strategies for gout include treatment of the acute flares and ameliorating the long-term consequences that contribute to disability. Current recommendations for managing acute flares include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or glucocorticoids. To prevent recurrent gout flares, the primary goal is to reduce serum urate concentrations, and lifelong administration of urate-lowering drugs is crucial. Lifestyle modifications (eg, bodyweight loss) and educational programmes focusing on dietary improvement could also be useful for long-term prevention of episodes or flares in people with gout.

Gout can lead to reduced mobility and impaired physical function, contributing to work absenteeism. In addition to its physical impacts, gout imposes an economic cost on those with the condition, with costs rising with increasing serum urate concentrations and the number of flares. Untreated gout places a substantial burden on the global health system, as chronic gout causes tophi formation, chronic joint pain, and erosion and damage to joints, resulting in an increase in morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Furthermore, despite advances in the treatment of gout, it is still underdiagnosed and undertreated, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and comorbidities. Therefore, quantifying the burden and pattern of gout cases by age and sex, as well as making projections for the future, are necessary to efficiently target the current and future needs of the population. We aimed to report the global, regional, and national burden and trends associated with gout and the burden attributed to risk factors, in terms of prevalence and age-standardised rates, from 1990 to 2020, as well as projections up to 2050.

### A prescription for lifestyle change in patients with hyperuricemia and gout [^eb79e270]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent data on lifestyle factors that influence serum uric acid levels and the risk of gout and attempts to provide holistic recommendations, considering both their impact on gout as well as on other health implications.

Recent Findings

Large-scale studies have clarified a number of long-suspected relations between lifestyle factors, hyperuricemia, and gout, including purine-rich foods, dairy foods, various beverages, fructose, and vitamin C supplementation. Furthermore, recent studies have identified the substantial burden of comorbidities among patients with hyperuricemia and gout.

Summary

Lifestyle and dietary recommendations for gout patients should consider overall health benefits and risk, since gout is often associated with the metabolic syndrome and an increased future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Weight reduction with daily exercise and limiting intake of red meat and sugary beverages would help reduce uric acid levels, the risk of gout, insulin resistance, and comorbidities. Heavy drinking should be avoided, whereas moderate drinking, sweet fruits, and seafood intake, particularly oily fish, should be tailored to the individual, considering their anticipated health benefits against CVD. Dairy products, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fruits (less sugary ones), and whole grains are healthy choices for the comorbidities of gout and may also help prevent gout by reducing insulin resistance. Coffee and vitamin C supplementation could be considered as preventive measures as these can lower urate levels, as well as the risk of gout and some of its comorbidities.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hyperuricemia recommendations and practice points state that "We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid–lowering intervention (1C)". Practice Point 3.14.1 advises to "Consider initiating urate acid-lowering therapy for people with CKD after their first episode of gout… serum uric acid concentration is > 9 mg/dl [535 μmol/l])". Practice Point 3.14.2 directs to "Prefer xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia". Practice Point 3.14.3 notes that "low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)", and Practice Point 3.14.4 adds that "Nonpharmacological interventions… include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake". Additionally, "We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D)".

### We can make gout management more successful now [^356223da]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Gout in primary care: can we improve patient outcomes? [^1b81a773]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Design

The preliminary study results revealed several important findings. Patients with poor medication compliance and higher urate levels experienced more flares of gout. A decision was made to contact each patient in the study cohort by telephone. The aim of this consultation was to understand the reasons which were leading to poor disease control. Each patient's knowledge about gout and the role of urate lowering therapies was assessed. It was predicted that poor levels of understanding about urate lowering therapies may be contributing to poor disease control.

In the first week of January 2015, all patients were contacted by telephone and asked a series of questions:
What do you currently know about gout? Do you know any dietary and lifestyle recommendations that can help improve gout control?
Would you like to be more knowledgable about gout? Would a diet, lifestyle and advice sheet about gout help to improve your level of knowledge?
Are you aware of annual uric acid monitoring whilst taking allopurinol?
Do you understand the role of allopurinol in gout management? Do you know that urate lowering therapies should be taken every day to prevent gout flares?

All answers to the above questions were recorded. 100% of respondents reported knowing very little about gout. The most commonly noted sources of information used by patients were internet based. Very few patients (n = 10), could name specific modifying lifestyle factors which could improve their disease control. Very few patients (n = 25), had received any written information from their general practitioner at the time of their diagnosis. Many patients, (n = 110), reported that their lack of knowledge of gout impaired their ability to manage their own condition. Although 79% (n = 91) of patients had their uric acid level measured within the last year, only 43% (n = 49) of patients were aware that this was necessary. Only 63% of patients (n = 73) knew that ULT were preventative and should be taken every day to reduce gout flares. 37% of patients (n = 42) thought that they did not need to take ULTs on a regular basis if they were not troubled by symptoms of gout. All patients were keen to receive a good quality, gout specific, diet, lifestyle and advice sheet. The telephone questionnaire identified patient education as an important area for improvement.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

Hyperuricaemia and monosodium urate crystal formation

Conditions which increase uric acid levels in the body (hyperuricaemia), such as increased intake or production of purines, as well as impaired excretion of uric acid by the kidneys, bear the risk that uric acid cannot be kept in solution and starts to precipitate into crystals. Concentrations of uric acid over 6.4 mg per decilitre, which exceed its solubilisation limit, allow the precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the tissue. Increased dietary purine intake by, for example, excessive meat and beer consumption, or increased endogenous purine production associated with cell and tissue catabolism during forced diet or tumour cell lysis, are well-known conditions which increase the uric acid level in the body and facilitate the precipitation of MSU crystals. In addition, decline in kidney function due to ageing, disease or drugs, such as diuretics and aspirin, impairs the appropriate excretion of uric acid and therefore also increases the risk for crystal deposition. On the other hand, pharmacological interventionsare able to lower serum uric acid levels in the body, thereby regaining solubility of uric acid and resolving even already existing MSU crystal deposits. Such measures include those which (1) effectively lower the production of uric acid such as the xanthine oxidase inhibitors allopurinol and febuxostat, or (2) those which directly cleave uric acid, such as the recombinant enzyme pegloticase, or (3) those fostering the excretion of uric acid through the kidneys, such as benzbromarone or lesinurad (figures 1–3).

### Long-term management of gout: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies [^bfabe508]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is a common disorder with clinical signs and symptoms resulting from inflammatory responses to monosodium urate crystals deposited in tissues from extracellular fluids saturated for urate. Long-term management of gout focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means to achieve and maintain serum urate levels in a subsaturating range. Despite a firm understanding of gout pathophysiology, means to achieve certain diagnosis, and a variety of effective therapies, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. In this review, available nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for chronic gout are discussed and a framework is provided for successful achievement and maintenance of goal-range serum urate levels.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Effects of lowering glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate on plasma uric acid levels: the omniCarb randomized clinical trial [^4a729114]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of carbohydrates on plasma uric acid levels are a subject of controversy. We determined the individual and combined effects of carbohydrate quality (the glycemic index) and quantity (the proportion of total daily energy [percentage of carbohydrates]) on uric acid levels.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, crossover trial of 4 different diets in overweight or obese adults without cardiovascular disease (n = 163). Participants consumed each of 4 diets over a 5-week period, each of which was separated by a 2-week washout period. Body weight was kept constant. The 4 diets were high glycemic index (≥ 65) with high percentage of carbohydrates (58% kcal), low glycemic index (≤ 45) with low percentage of carbohydrates (40% kcal), low glycemic index with high percentage of carbohydrates, and high glycemic index with low percentage of carbohydrates. Plasma uric acid levels were measured at baseline and after completion of each 5-week period for comparison between the 4 diets.

Results

Of the 163 study participants, 52% were women and 50% were non-Hispanic African American subjects; their mean age was 52.6 years, and their mean ± SD uric acid level was 4.7 ± 1.2 mg/dl. Reducing the glycemic index lowered uric acid levels when the percentage of carbohydrates was low (-0.24 mg/dl; P < 0.001) or high (-0.17 mg/dl; P < 0.001). Reducing the percentage of carbohydrates marginally increased the uric acid level only when the glycemic index was high (P = 0.05). The combined effect of lowering the glycemic index and increasing the percentage of carbohydrates was -0.27 mg/dl (P < 0.001). This effect was observed even after adjustment for concurrent changes in kidney function, insulin sensitivity, and products of glycolysis.

Conclusion

Reducing the glycemic index lowers uric acid levels. Future studies should examine whether reducing the glycemic index can prevent gout onset or flares.
