## Question

should beta blockers be continued for life after MI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether beta-blockers should be continued for life after myocardial infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the indication varies by left ventricular ejection fraction and heart failure status. Then, I should verify what contemporary randomized trials say for patients with preserved LVEF. Next, I will review guideline positions and their evolution. After that, I need to examine observational data on duration and dose. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note ongoing uncertainties and special populations, anchoring to high-quality trials and guidelines throughout [^115GESPd] [^112kxjAQ] [^117ATT8R] [^115ejtnx].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: the answer is not binary and hinges on LV function, heart failure, angina, arrhythmias, and hypertension, because these factors shift the risk–benefit calculus for beta-blockers after MI. Hold on, I should verify the strongest evidence base: patients with reduced LVEF or heart failure have clear, sustained benefit from beta-blockers, whereas patients with preserved LVEF and no ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias are where the controversy lies, so I need to keep that distinction front and center [^115s7oqJ] [^117ATT8R].

> I will now examine the highest-risk group with LVEF 40% or less or clinical heart failure. The CAPRICORN trial in post-MI LV dysfunction showed a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality with carvedilol, and the curves continued to diverge for years, supporting long-term therapy in this phenotype, so indefinite continuation is appropriate unless contraindicated. Wait, let me verify guideline alignment: ESC 2023 gives a Class I recommendation to initiate beta-blockers in ACS with LVEF 40% or less, and contemporary guidance supports chronic continuation in heart failure for mortality benefit, which reinforces lifelong therapy in this subgroup [^115TzQni].

> Next, I should review patients with mildly reduced LVEF, roughly 40–49%, where evidence has been sparse. Let me consider the latest pooled data: an individual patient data meta-analysis of four recent RCTs in MI with mildly reduced LVEF and no overt heart failure showed that beta-blockers reduced a composite of death, recurrent MI, or heart failure, extending benefit from reduced EF into this mid-range stratum. I should double-check heterogeneity: there was no significant heterogeneity across trials, which strengthens confidence in a modest but real benefit signal in this group, supporting continuation beyond a year in most patients [^111daV4Y].

> Now, for the largest and most debated group — preserved LVEF of 50% or higher without heart failure, angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension — I need to check the most definitive contemporary RCTs. The REDUCE-AMI trial in revascularized patients with LVEF at least 50% showed no reduction in death or recurrent MI with beta-blockers versus no beta-blockers over a median 3.5 years, arguing against routine long-term use in this exact phenotype. But wait, what if interruption is unsafe? The ABYSS trial tested stopping beta-blockers a median 2.9 years after MI in stable patients with LVEF at least 40% and found that interruption failed noninferiority, with more cardiovascular hospitalizations, suggesting potential harm from withdrawal in some settings. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are different populations and designs, so I should reconcile them as mixed signals rather than contradictory mandates [^112kxjAQ] [^115GESPd].

> Let me synthesize the preserved-LVEF evidence carefully. On one hand, REDUCE-AMI supports that initiating or continuing beta-blockers long term does not improve hard outcomes in optimally treated, revascularized patients with LVEF at least 50%. On the other hand, ABYSS suggests that abrupt withdrawal in otherwise stable, chronic post-MI patients may increase cardiovascular hospitalizations, implying that if a patient is already on a beta-blocker and tolerating it, cautious continuation can be reasonable, especially if there are borderline features or evolving risk. I should confirm that neither trial showed a mortality difference, which aligns with a neutral mortality signal in preserved EF but raises caution about withdrawal effects in real-world cohorts [^112kxjAQ] [^112JGQwk].

> Next, I should review guideline evolution to ensure my interpretation matches current standards. The 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline advises reassessing the indication for long-term beta-blockers beyond 1 year after MI in patients without reduced LVEF, angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension, effectively moving away from automatic lifelong therapy in preserved-LVEF patients. Initially, I thought ESC 2023 might recommend indefinite beta-blockers for all post-MI patients, but wait, I should verify — ESC 2023 recommends initiating beta-blockers in ACS broadly, yet it prioritizes long-term continuation for those with LVEF 40% or less and is less prescriptive about indefinite therapy in preserved EF, aligning with a more selective, indication-driven approach rather than universal lifelong use [^117ATT8R] [^112NUZCk] [^114TrX6M].

> I need to check observational data on duration and dose to see if there are pragmatic signals. Several registries suggest that very early discontinuation, especially within 180 days, may be associated with more recurrent MI and revascularization, particularly after STEMI, whereas continuation beyond 3 years shows mixed mortality signals in preserved EF cohorts. Let me reconsider dose nuances: OBTAIN and Danish registry analyses suggest a dose–response with optimal benefit in the 12.5–25% to 25–50% of target dose range, but these are observational and vulnerable to confounding, so I should not over-interpret them as prescriptive targets [^115oTN34] [^114QrmSe] [^116h3vXe] [^117HaJRD].

> Putting this together, I should confirm a risk-stratified recommendation. For patients with LVEF 40% or less or heart failure, beta-blockers should generally be continued indefinitely given robust mortality benefit. For patients with mildly reduced LVEF 40–49% without overt heart failure, the recent IPD meta-analysis supports continuation, at least for several years, given the composite outcome reduction. For patients with LVEF 50% or higher and no angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension, routine lifelong beta-blocker therapy is not supported; after 6–12 months of stability, I should reassess and consider de-escalation, but if already on a tolerated beta-blocker, continuation is reasonable with shared decision-making, and if stopping, taper gradually while monitoring for ischemia or arrhythmias. I should double-check that this aligns with both REDUCE-AMI and the ABYSS noninferiority failure, which it does [^112kxjAQ] [^115GESPd].

> But wait, what about special populations and practicalities? In older adults with frailty or cognitive impairment, beta-blockers can reduce mortality yet may worsen functional status, so I need to individualize and sometimes prioritize quality of life and goals of care. In diabetes, COPD, or PAD, cardioselective agents and careful titration usually allow safe use when indicated, but I should confirm there are no absolute contraindications like high-grade AV block. If discontinuation is pursued, I should taper over 1–2 weeks and monitor for rebound ischemia or tachyarrhythmias, especially in patients with prior STEMI or incomplete revascularization [^113Eo7pV] [^1166iE8c] [^111iUfe5].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and ongoing work. Multiple contemporary RCTs are underway or recently completed, and an accompanying editorial to REDUCE-AMI rightly notes that more trials will refine duration, dose, and patient selection. Until then, I need to ensure my approach is evidence-aligned and dynamic: use beta-blockers long term for reduced EF and heart failure, consider continuation in mildly reduced EF, and avoid reflexive lifelong therapy in preserved EF without indications, while reassessing yearly and tailoring to symptoms, ischemia, arrhythmias, and hypertension [^112kxjAQ] [^117ATT8R].

Beta-blockers should not be continued indefinitely after myocardial infarction for all patients [^117ATT8R]. Current evidence shows **no mortality benefit** from long-term use in patients with preserved LVEF and no ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias [^112kxjAQ]. Guidelines recommend continuing beta-blockers for at least **1–3 years** after MI [^11451148], then reassessing the need based on LVEF, symptoms, and risk [^117ATT8R]. Lifelong therapy is reserved for patients with reduced LVEF, heart failure, ongoing angina, or arrhythmias [^117ATT8R]. For patients with preserved LVEF and no active indications, discontinuation after 1–3 years is reasonable, with **tapering to avoid rebound effects** [^111iUfe5].

---

## Historical evidence and guidelines

Historically, **beta-blockers** have been a cornerstone of secondary prevention after MI, with multiple trials demonstrating significant reductions in mortality and recurrent MI [^115TzQni]. Early guidelines recommended **indefinite beta-blocker therapy** for all post-MI patients **unless contraindicated** [^113agA6b]. However, these recommendations were based largely on data from the pre-reperfusion era, when modern therapies such as primary PCI, dual antiplatelet therapy, high-intensity statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors were not standard [^111NkYEz].

---

## Contemporary evidence and evolving guidelines

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have challenged the notion of **indefinite beta-blocker therapy** for all post-MI patients, particularly those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and no ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias [^1174Jevm]. The REDUCE-AMI trial, published in 2024, found **no significant benefit of long-term beta-blocker therapy** in patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 50%) following MI, with no reduction in the composite endpoint of death or recurrent MI compared to no beta-blocker therapy [^112kxjAQ]. Similarly, the ABYSS trial found that interrupting beta-blocker therapy in stable post-MI patients with preserved LVEF did not result in non-inferior outcomes compared to continuation, suggesting **no clear benefit of indefinite therapy** in this population [^115GESPd].

In response to this evidence, contemporary guidelines have shifted toward a more **individualized approach** [^117ATT8R]. The 2023 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend reassessing the indication for long-term beta-blocker therapy **beyond one year post-MI** in patients without reduced LVEF, angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension [^117ATT8R]. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines similarly emphasize the role of beta-blockers primarily in patients with **reduced LVEF or ongoing ischemia**, without recommending indefinite therapy for all post-MI patients [^112NUZCk].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration of therapy

The decision to continue or discontinue beta-blockers after MI should be individualized based on several patient-specific factors:

- **Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)**: Patients with reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) or heart failure should generally continue beta-blockers long-term due to proven benefits in reducing mortality, recurrent MI, and heart failure progression [^117ATT8R].

- **Presence of angina or arrhythmias**: Patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms or arrhythmias may benefit from continued beta-blocker therapy for symptom control and arrhythmia prevention [^117ATT8R].

- **Risk of adverse effects**: Beta-blockers are associated with side effects such as bradycardia, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction, which may limit their tolerability and adherence, particularly in older adults [^112kxjAQ].

- **Patient preference and quality of life**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient preferences, quality of life, and the potential burden of long-term medication use [^112RMdvd].

---

## Risks and benefits of long-term beta-blocker therapy

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced recurrent MI** — historically demonstrated, though less pronounced in contemporary practice with modern secondary prevention strategies [^111xoJvV] — and **improved symptoms**, with beta-blockers effective for controlling angina and arrhythmias in appropriately selected patients [^112fZaQ9].

---

### Risks

- **Adverse effects**: Fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and potential worsening of glucose control in diabetic patients [^1166iE8c].

- **Polypharmacy**: Long-term beta-blocker therapy adds to the medication burden, potentially reducing adherence to other essential medications [^113TKBHw].

- **Lack of benefit in preserved LVEF**: Recent evidence suggests no significant benefit in patients with preserved LVEF and no ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias [^112kxjAQ].

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Based on contemporary evidence and guidelines, the following clinical recommendations are proposed:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended duration of beta-blocker therapy** |
|-|-|
| Reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) or heart failure | Indefinite therapy unless contraindicated [^11451148] |
| Preserved LVEF (> 40%) with ongoing angina or arrhythmias | Continue therapy as long as symptoms persist [^117ATT8R] |
| Preserved LVEF (> 40%) without ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias | Reassess after 1–3 years; consider discontinuation if no ongoing indications [^112RMdvd] |

---

## Practical approach to discontinuation

When discontinuing beta-blockers, the following practical steps are recommended:

- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce the dose gradually over 1–2 weeks to avoid rebound effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, or ischemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor patients for recurrence of angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure symptoms during and after discontinuation [^notfound].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative medications for symptom control or risk reduction if beta-blockers are discontinued (e.g. calcium channel blockers for angina, anticoagulants for arrhythmias) [^notfound].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Several ongoing RCTs are investigating the optimal duration and dosing of beta-blocker therapy post-MI, including the SMART-DECISION and REBOOT-CNIC trials [^113RtGnG]. These studies will provide further clarity on the role of beta-blockers in contemporary practice and help refine guidelines [^111n2ER3].

---

Beta-blockers should not be continued indefinitely after **MI** for all patients [^117ATT8R]. The decision to continue or discontinue therapy should be individualized based on **LVEF**, ongoing ischemia, arrhythmias, patient preference, and tolerability [^1174Jevm]. Lifelong therapy is recommended for patients with reduced LVEF or heart failure, while patients with preserved LVEF and no ongoing indications may discontinue therapy after **1–3 years** [^11451148].

Background

The appropriate duration of treatment with beta-blocker drugs after a myocardial infarction is unknown. Data are needed on the safety and efficacy of the interruption of long-term beta-blocker treatment to reduce side effects and improve quality of life in patients with a history of uncomplicated myocardial infarction.

Methods

In a multicenter, open label, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted at 49 sites in France, we randomly assigned patients with a history of myocardial infarction, in a 1:1 ratio, to interruption or continuation of beta-blocker treatment. All the patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40% while receiving long-term beta-blocker treatment and had no history of a cardiovascular event in the previous 6 months. The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons at the longest follow-up (minimum, 1 year), according to an analysis of noninferiority (defined as a between-group difference of < 3 percentage points for the upper boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval). The main secondary end point was the change in quality of life as measured by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire.

Results

A total of 3698 patients underwent randomization: 1846 to the interruption group and 1852 to the continuation group. The median time between the last myocardial infarction and randomization was 2.9 years (interquartile range, 1.2 to 6.4), and the median follow-up was 3.0 years (interquartile range, 2.0 to 4.0). A primary-outcome event occurred in 432 of 1812 patients (23.8%) in the interruption group and in 384 of 1821 patients (21.1%) in the continuation group (risk difference, 2.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, < 0.1 to 5.5), for a hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33; P = 0.44 for noninferiority). Beta-blocker interruption did not seem to improve the patients' quality of life.

Conclusions

In patients with a history of myocardial infarction, interruption of long-term beta-blocker treatment was not found to be noninferior to a strategy of beta-blocker continuation.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

Beta blockers have long been used in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction. However, many new therapies are available for this patient group, and as a result, the current role of beta blockers may have become uncertain. In this article we address a series of questions related to the important and continuing role of beta blockade after myocardial infarction.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^112KbtXM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical data strongly supported the benefits of beta-blocker therapy following a myocardial infarction (MI) for its efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, in the context of the progressive evolution of treatment strategies for MI patients, the apparent benefit of beta-blocker therapy is becoming less clear. In particular, its effectiveness in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction is currently being challenged. Consequently, contemporary guidelines are now varying in their recommendations regarding the role of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients. This review aims to summarize and compare the largest and most influential studies from the prereperfusion era to modern practice regarding different health outcomes while highlighting the need for further research to clarify beta-blocker therapy's place in contemporary post-MI management.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^113TKBHw]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review has demonstrated that although beta-blocker therapy has been a fundamental part of secondary prevention post-MI for decades, recent evidence suggests its effectiveness in patients with preserved LVEF is inconclusive. Variability across observational studies, RCTs, and meta-analyses, due to differences in study populations, limits comparability. An umbrella review focused on populations with similar LVEF could improve generalizability and inform future research and clinical guidelines.

Many questions remain, including the most useful type of beta-blocker agent, optimal dosage, which patients benefit most, and its role across different ACS types. The role of beta-blocker therapy in contemporary MI management is evolving, with evidence suggesting their use should be more selective and tailored to high-risk patients. Ongoing trials are expected to clarify their optimal use in the era of modern reperfusion therapies.

Ceasing beta-blocker therapy in patients without a clear benefit could streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and lessen the overall burden on patients and health care systems. In addition, it could mitigate the negative effects of polypharmacy and enhance medication adherence. However, before discontinuing beta-blocker therapy, it is critical to undertake a thorough risk-benefit clinical evaluation, similar to the protocols applied to patients with recovered heart failure with reduced LVEF.

Conclusions

Given the tremendous advances that have been made in the management of acute MI and post‐MI treatments, it is necessary to reconsider the role of beta‐blocker therapy. However, the relevant question is no longer whether all patients with acute MI should be treated with beta‐blockers. The OBTAIN studyand this substudy support the need for a new paradigm that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose. An important role for personalized medicine in the management of this diverse patient population must be incorporated. Further randomized clinical trials are required to prospectively test dosing and treatment durations for beta‐blocker therapy following acute MI.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^1174Jevm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The long-term impact of beta-blocker use after myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Although there are robust data supporting post-MI beta-blocker use in the prereperfusion era and in the setting of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), data on long-term beta-blocker use among contemporary populations or those with preserved LVEF are conflicting. The REDUCE-AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers After Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial showed no benefit of long-term beta-blocker use among patients with MI with preserved LVEF. In contrast, interruption of beta-blocker use among patients with prior MI was not noninferior to continuation in the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta blocker interruption one Year after uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization) trial, with patients in the interruption group having greater cardiovascular hospitalizations. There are 5 other ongoing randomized controlled trials investigating this question (, and).

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the real-world long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction?

What is the main finding?

Overall use of beta-blockers postmyocardial infarction was low, but there was evidence of treatment inertia with minimal de-escalation beyond 10 years among those on beta-blockers.

As our understanding of post-MI beta-blocker efficacy increases, guidelines on the use of beta-blockers after MI have consequently evolved. Use of beta-blockers was recommended for at least 3 years after MI for secondary prevention in 2012 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology chronic coronary disease (CCD) guidelines. The 2023 CCD guideline update no longer recommends the use of long-term beta-blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI unless patients exhibit a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%, angina, or another primary indication for beta-blockers.

In light of ongoing clinical trials and changes in guidelines, evaluation of real-world patterns in the long-term use of beta-blocker therapy among patients with prior MI has not yet been performed. Therefore, we used large, nationally representative survey data to assess long-term use of beta-blockers after MI in the United States.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^113Kh7uj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The beneficial effect of β‐blocker therapy after AMI may be limited to until 1 year after AMI. Whether late β‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after AMI offers clinical benefit and whether β‐blockers should be switched to other classes of antihypertensive agents in patients after AMI with hypertension should be confirmed in further clinical trials.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^1153x9DM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The most recent guidelines, recommend beta‐blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction (MI). These guidelines do not generally address duration of treatment, but treatment has been recommended for at least 3 years. The predominance of data supporting beta‐blocker use after MI derives from multiple randomized clinical trials performed in the 1970s and 1980s, before the standard use of some of the currently available therapies that also improve survival including primary percutaneous coronary intervention/thrombolysis, aspirin, statins, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. A meta‐analysissuggested that beta‐blockers are not effective in the postthrombolysis era, though this was driven largely by the findings of the COMMIT (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial) trial. Although early trials, such as the Norwegian timolol trial, demonstrated preservation of the improved outcome associated with beta‐blocker use for as long as 6 years, the survival curves continue to diverge only slightly beyond 1 year and for a limited period of time, raising the question whether beta‐blocker use should be continued beyond this time period. None of the randomized clinical trials performed a landmark analysis of the efficacy of beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI.

The OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) studywas a multicenter observational registry designed to evaluate the effect of beta‐blocker dose on outcome after MI. Although the study hypothesized that greater benefit would be observed with the use of beta‐blocker doses that were targeted in the randomized clinical trials that demonstrated the efficacy of beta‐blocker therapy after MI compared with lower doses, no such benefit was observed, though there was an overall benefit to beta‐blocker therapy. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy of continued beta‐blocker therapy and the effect of dose among patients who survived 1 year after myocardial infarction. Based upon the primary OBTAIN analysis, we postulated that the optimum survival would be noted in patients treated with 25% of the target doses of beta‐blockers used in the randomized clinical trials.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^112hipVm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to investigate long-term use of beta-blockers after MI in the United States using a large, nationally representative dataset. This question cannot be answered using existing U.S. clinical trial or registry data due to limited long-term follow-up or lack of generalizability.

Overall rates of beta-blocker use in the first year after MI were low, similar to prior studies, suggesting a failure to initiate or continue guideline-recommended treatment in the early post-MI period, though uncertainty on the utility of beta-blockers in the contemporary early post-MI period exists.

We also found that use of beta-blockers beyond the first year after MI remained stable. Rates of beta-blocker use increased in years 2 to 3 compared to the first year after MI among patients without HF or angina. This group of patients would likely be targeted for de-escalation based on the updated CCD guidelines, yet currently have the highest beta-blocker use. Moreover, we found high rates of beta-blocker use beyond 3 years among patients without HF or angina, despite a lack of class I indication beyond 3 years in prior guidelines. Although it is possible that some of these patients had another indication for beta-blocker use, these patients would likely be most affected by the results of recently completed and ongoing clinical trials of post-MI beta-blocker use.

Our results highlight the importance of re-evaluating long-term post-MI beta-blocker use as results of ongoing clinical trials become known. Persistent use of beta-blockers among angina-free patients with preserved LVEF beyond 10 years after MI is suggestive of therapeutic inertia. Therapeutic inertia is typically considered as a failure to initiate or intensify recommended therapy, but it also encompasses failure to deintensify therapy when no longer necessary. Regardless of whether the consensus emerging from contemporary trials favors continuation or interruption of beta-blocker therapy long-term, approximately half of all U.S. angina-free patients with preserved LVEF post-MI will warrant consideration of therapy modification.

A limitation of this study is that it does not account for cohort effects, as patients who are 5 years from MI had MI at a different period than those of 0 to 1 year from MI. However, there have been no major changes in recommendations regarding beta-blockers and minimal changes in overall therapeutic strategy for MI during this period.

Table 2
Meta-Analyses Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

For decades, clinical guidelines have extrapolated these results to make recommendations in an ever-changing clinical setting. Yet these recommendations have been constrained by several factors. First, most RCTs were conducted in controlled environments with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may not capture the full spectrum of patients encountered in routine care. Second, the populations studied often included patients with large MI, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which may not reflect the current clinical setting. Additionally, various study limitations, such as high risk of bias, operational definitions of beta-blocker therapy mainly as intravenous treatment, lack of subanalyses by MI type or LVEF, and variation in beta-blocker agents and dosages, have further complicated the interpretation of results.

ESC Guidelines: Long-Term Beta-Blocker Therapy for Post-Myocardial Infarction Prevention

This figure illustrates key updates in the ESC guidelines on beta-blocker therapy for secondary prevention following MI, from 2017 to 2023. It highlights evolving recommendations for patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, heart failure, and a history of MI, as well as the class of recommendation and level of evidence for beta-blocker use in ACS and chronic coronary syndromes. The figure also reflects a shift toward broader use of beta-blockers in ACS patients, regardless of heart failure status. ESC = European Society of Cardiology; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

Figure 3
NHFA/CSANZ Guidelines: Long-Term Beta-Blocker Therapy for Post-Myocardial Infarction Prevention

This figure summarizes the 2016 NHFA and CSANZ guidelines on beta-blocker use for secondary prevention after MI. It emphasizes initiating beta-blockers in patients with reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) unless contraindicated, with a class IIa recommendation and level a evidence for this high-risk group. NHFA/CSANZ = National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

These variations in guidelines contribute to differing prescription rates globally. For instance, 93% of eligible patients in Europe receive beta-blockers, compared to just 56.5% in South-East Asia. In Italy, more than one-half of MI patients were prescribed beta-blocker therapy, though prescription rates have declined over time. In Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 33% of adults with CVD used beta-blockers in 2017 to 2018, though adherence rates are suboptimal, with only 73% continuing therapy after 12 months.

Several ongoing trials are expected to provide greater clarity on the optimal use of beta-blocker therapy in the context of modern reperfusion therapies. The following RCTs are assessing the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 40%): the DANBLOCK (Danish trial of beta-blocker treatment after myocardial infarction without reduced ejection fraction), the BETAMI (BEtablocker Treatment After acute Myocardial Infarction in revascularized patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), and the REBOOT (tREatment with Beta-blockers after myOcardial infarction withOut reduced ejection fracTion) trial. The results from these studies are anticipated to inform and potentially improve current clinical guidelines.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^116WCsLi]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, we find overall low use of beta-blocker therapy post-MI and evidence of treatment inertia with minimal de-escalation among those on beta-blockers in contemporary U.S. practice. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of post-MI patients may be affected by the results of recently completed and ongoing clinical trials as well as CCD guideline changes.

Implications on guidelines

Current evidence on beta-blocker therapy, largely derived from observational studies, is conflicting, leading to variability in clinical guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends beta-blockers for patients with STEMI or NSTEMI and reduced LVEF (< 40%), and suggests long-term treatment for those with a history of prior MI, though without specifying duration. Its current guideline for ACS management recommends beta-blocker use in patients with LVEF ≤ 40% but does not distinguish between STEMI and NSTEMI or provide guidance on long-term therapy (Figure 2). Similarly, the current AHA/ACC guideline for chronic coronary disease management recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 50% but advises reassessing the indication of treatment at 1-year post-MI for patients without reduced LVEF. They do not recommend long-term therapy for those with LVEF > 50%. The National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (NHFA/CSANZ) Guidelines for ACS management (Figure 3) recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 40%, without differentiating between STEMI and NSTEMI, and lacks clear guidance for those with LVEF > 40%.

ACS = acute coronary syndrome; AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology; CAD = coronary artery disease; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MACE = major adverse cardiac events; MI = myocardial infarction; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Beta-blocker therapy in the reperfusion era

The observed clinical benefits of beta-blocker therapy during the prereperfusion era are attributed to complex mechanisms of the beta-adrenoceptor blockade, including a reduction in myocardial work and thus myocardial oxygen consumption, reduced wall stress leading to less remodeling and anti-arrhythmic actions. However, its benefits appear less significant within the framework of modern practice. This is mainly due to the introduction of early reperfusion therapies with newer thrombolytic agents and invasive strategies, such as the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the late 1970s. The emergence of this reperfusion therapy increased rates of myocardial salvage and decreased ischemic times, leading to reduced mortality rates for MI patients. Furthermore, new progressive pharmacotherapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors facilitated the improvement of LVEF by mitigating ventricular remodeling, while statins enhanced survival by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of recurrent CV events post-MI. In addition, these therapies have also enhanced patients' quality of life while avoiding the multiple side effects commonly associated with beta-blocker therapy.

### Β eta blocker interruption after uncomplicated myocardial infarction: rationale and design of the randomized ABYSS trial [^112gjUfB]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term use of β-blocker after myocardial infarction (MI) when global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is preserved has not been studied in the era of modern myocardial reperfusion and secondary prevention therapies. It is unknown whether β-blockers are useful in stable post-MI patients without reduced LVEF and without heart failure.

Methods

The Assessment of β-blocker interruption 1 Year after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization (ABYSS) Trial enrolled in 49 centers in France, 3,700 patients with a prior (> 6 months) history of MI and a LVEF > 40%, chronically treated with a β-blocker and without any major cardiovascular event (MACE) in the past 6 months. These patients were randomized to interruption or continuation of their β-blocker therapy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the noninferiority of interruption vs continuation of the β-blocker therapy on the primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, MI, hospitalization for any cardiovascular reason at the end of follow-up (accrual follow-up) with a one-year minimum follow-up for the last randomized patient. Secondary objectives will focus on patient reported outcomes with the evaluation of the quality of life before and after randomization with the EQ5D-5L questionnaire. Enrolment has been completed.

Conclusion

The ABYSS trial evaluates the cardiovascular safety of β-blocker interruption in stabilized post-MI patients without heart failure nor reduced LVEF. ABYSS trial is a reappraisal of β-blockers life-long therapy in stable post-MI patients without reduced LVEF.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^111NkYEz]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, prereperfusion evidence on beta-blocker therapy strongly influenced the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation (AHA/ACCF) clinical guidelines until 2013 (Figure 1). For example, the 2011 Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients With Coronary and Other Atherosclerotic Vascular Diseases guideline recommended beta-blocker therapy for all patients with LVEF < 40% and post-MI patients regardless of LVEF, even beyond 3 years. Similarly, the 2013 AHA/ACCF Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) guidelines suggested beta-blocker therapy for all hospital discharged patients without contraindications. However, a 2014 meta-analysis by Bangalore et al, which included over 60 RCTs and 102,003 patients, revealed a significant interaction between beta-blocker therapy and reperfusion status (Table 2). Beta-blocker therapy reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (incident rate ratio [IRR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79–0.94) and recurrence of MI (IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62–0.97) in the prereperfusion era. Yet, in the reperfusion era, where over 50% of patients received thrombolytics or underwent revascularization, beta-blocker therapy did not significantly reduce mortality (IRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.92–1.05). As a result, the 2014 AHA/ACCF Management of Patients with Non–ST-Elevation (NSTEMI) Acute Coronary Syndromes guidelines strongly recommended beta-blocker therapy in patients with reduced LVEFand suggested continuing therapy beyond 3 years for patients with normal LVEF and no angina, given the unclear evidence for long-term benefits in this group. The Bangalore et alfindings highlighted that up until 2014, most evidence regarding the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy pertained to patients with reduced LVEF, prompting questions regarding the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in more stable patients with preserved LVEF and the optimal duration of its use.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^115rMdJp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of BBL therapy after MI is aligned with current guidelines from the United States and Europe, but recommendations on the duration of therapy are broad or not stated because of the knowledge gap. In this study, the highest‐risk subgroups derived the greatest benefit from long‐term therapy, but in no subgroup did the results favor a short duration. Fortunately, BBLs are generally well tolerated at low to moderate doses. At the time of MI, patients often inquire about the number and type of medications being prescribed, as well as asking about the necessary duration of therapy. Currently, an antiplatelet agent and statin are the only medications on the indefinite list for a patient without heart failure. On the basis of this study, the routine use of BBLs beyond 36 months is reasonable, particularly in high‐risk patients. In lower‐risk patients and those intolerant of BBLs because of hemodynamics or adverse effects, an individualized approach to duration is needed. Until new data are available, we can conclude that a little BBL probably goes a long way.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113WN5fs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-recommended therapy for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and beta-blockers (BBs). BBs are a cornerstone of treatment for ischemic heart disease in the acute phase because they inhibit the physiological sympathetic activation, reduce myocardial workload, reduce infarct size, and have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. BB also have a well-defined role in long-term therapy of patients with persistent reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the role of longer-term BB treatment when AMI course is not complicated by heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, recurrent ischemia, or arrhythmia is not well established. Most guidelines recommend BB use in the absence of contraindications with grade 1B evidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and grade 2A in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The recommendation for BB use after AMI predominately comes from studies that predate routine implementation of a contemporary strategy of early reperfusion and medical therapy. Recent guidelines report uncertainty in the strength of the evidence for long-term use of BB post revascularization with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Observational studies that have evaluated the duration of BB use and outcomes after AMI have several limitations, including incomplete ascertainment or heterogeneous definitions of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction, inclusion of patients with independent indications or contraindications to BB, lack of longitudinal prescription data, and relatively short durations of follow-up. Two recently published open-label randomized clinical trials have added to this literature but have not completely resolved the dilemma. The REDUCE AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial found that initiating BBs in MI survivors with preserved LVEF at the time of discharge did not reduce the incidence of death from any cause or recurrent AMI, whereas the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta-Blocker Interruption 1 Year after an Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction on Safety and Symptomatic Cardiac Events Requiring Hospitalization) trial failed to find that interrupting BBs a mean of 2.9 years after MI was noninferior to continuing them, for a composite primary endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. We sought to assess the association between discontinuation of newly prescribed BB within 180 days after AMI and long-term cardiovascular outcomes among a well-characterized, population-based cohort of AMI survivors without definite indications for long-term BB therapy.

### Β-blockers and mortality after acute myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure or ventricular dysfunction [^1132gVGd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

No randomized trials have tested the efficacy of β-blockers on long-term mortality among patients with AMI without HF or LVSD. Until now, the largest study, which comprised 6,758 propensity score–matched patients with AMI, found no reduction in mortality according to use of β-blockers. Notably, this study censored data in 2009 and did not investigate the impact of β-blockers on mortality among patients without HF or according to diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI. A smaller, but more recent study found that the discontinuation of β-blockers at 1 year was not associated with higher 5-year mortality. This finding is important because guidelines recommend that β-blockers be prescribed long term for patients after AMI who have HF, and it is uncertain as to whether β-blockers are beneficial for patients without HF but who have presented to the hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI.

In an era of coronary revascularization for AMI, whether it is primary PCI for acute STEMI or a risk-dependent early invasive strategy for NSTEMI, the likelihood of preserving more viable and therefore less arrhythmogenic myocardium is potentially greater than that of the noninterventional era. Arguably, in the absence of HF or LVSD, our study revealed that such patients who do not use β-blockers are at equal risk of death as those who do. Moreover, we found that the lack of effect of β-blockers on survival was evident for both STEMI and NSTEMI, and at early and later time points. Because β-blockers are not without potential harm, and given that many patients report side effects and that incremental numbers of medications are associated with reduced drug adherence, secondary prevention medications at hospital discharge for patients with AMI and without HF may not need to include β-blockers. Indeed, the European Society of Cardiology STEMI guidelines suggest that β-blockers be commenced in-hospital and continued long term after AMI but only with a Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B recommendation. For NSTEMI, a Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation is provided for the use of β-blockers but only in the context of HF. This recommendation contrasts with the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, which recommend oral β-blockers as a Class I indication for all patients with AMI who do not have a contraindication.

### Health and economic benefits of increased β-blocker use following myocardial infarction [^112BvyMC]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context

beta-blockers are underused in patients who have myocardial infarction (MI), despite the proven efficacy of these agents. New evidence indicates that beta-blockers can have benefit in patients with conditions that have been considered relative contraindications. Understanding the consequences of underuse of beta-blockers is important because of the implications for current policy debates over quality-of-care measures and Medicare prescription drug coverage.

Objective

To examine the potential health and economic impact of increased use of beta-blockers in patients who have had MI.

Design and Setting

We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model, a computer-simulation Markov model of CHD in the US population, to estimate the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of increased beta-blocker use from current to target levels among survivors of MI aged 35 to 84 years. Simulations included 1 cohort of MI survivors in 2000 followed up for 20 years and 20 successive annual cohorts of all first-MI survivors in 2000–2020. Mortality and morbidity from CHD were derived from published meta-analyses and recent studies. This analysis used a societal perspective.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevented MIs, CHD mortality, life-years gained, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in 2000–2020.

Results

Initiating beta-blocker use for all MI survivors except those with absolute contraindications in 2000 and continuing treatment for 20 years would result in 4300 fewer CHD deaths, 3500 MIs prevented, and 45,000 life-years gained compared with current use. The incremental cost per QALY gained would be $4500. If this increase in beta-blocker use were implemented in all first-MI survivors annually over 20 years, beta-blockers would save $18 million and result in 72,000 fewer CHD deaths, 62,000 MIs prevented, and 447,000 life-years gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy would always be less than $11,000 per QALY gained, even under unfavorable assumptions, and may even be cost saving. Restricting beta-blockers only to ideal patients (those without absolute or relative contraindications) would reduce the epidemiological impact of beta-blocker therapy by about 60%.

Conclusions

Our simulation indicates that increased use of beta-blockers after MI would lead to impressive gains in health and would be potentially cost saving. JAMA. 2000;284:2748–2754.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111y83Ki]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Some milestone studies such as the BHAT (The Beta‐blocker Heart Attack Trial), and the ISIS‐I (First International Study of Infarct Survival) had established that beta‐blockers can significantly reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) was published in the 1980s. The beta‐blockers then become a central component of pharmacological treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subsequently, progress has been made in the treatment of MI and mortality has decreased remarkably thanks to the application of treatments such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet drugs, and statins. Because of this, it is questionable whether beta‐blockers can still benefit AMI patients at a time when reperfusion treatment and secondary prevention therapy are widely available.

There are difficulties in the precise application of beta‐blockers in patients with AMI. Guidelines are inconsistent regarding the indication population for beta‐blocker therapy. Evidence demonstrates that beta‐blocker therapy is essential as a cornerstone in the treatment of AMI patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF < 40%). However, the efficacy of beta‐blockers in AMI patients with midrange/preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 40%) is unclear. Also, Guidelines or consensus, with fewer recommendations for the duration of beta‐blocker therapy after AMI. 2012 ACCF recommends that beta‐blocker therapy be continued for 3 years in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who have a normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 40%). The latest ESC Guidelines for the management of AMI in patients presenting with ST‐segment elevation do not give any recommendations in this respect. The Canadian Heart Research Centre recommends, based on consensus, patients with a mild‐moderate reduction of left ventricular function (LVEF ≥ 40%) who have undergone successful reperfusion, treatment discontinuation could be considered after 6 months. The benefits of early beta‐blocker therapy have been demonstrated, whereas few studies have been conducted on the duration of beta‐blocker therapy, with more attention focused on the impact of long‐term beta‐blocker therapy on outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to learn the effect of continuous beta‐blockers therapy (lasted ≥ 6 months) on AMI patients without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^112fZaQ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a high‐risk group with increased mortality even after successful revascularization; thus, the current practice guidelines emphasize the importance of intensive risk factor modification, including hypertension in patients with AMI. 1

β‐Blockers have improved survival and are one of the cornerstones in the treatment of ischemic heart disease; they exert an antianginal effect by reducing the myocardial workload and oxygen demand. 2 Besides, they also have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. 3 The effects of β‐blockers have been extensively investigated in patients with AMI, 4, 5, 6, 7 and the current practice guidelines also recommend the use of β‐blockers in all patients after AMI unless contraindicated. 1, 8

Although the effects of β‐blockers on short‐term outcomes are well established, data on their long‐term effects are scarce, especially beyond 1 year after AMI. In addition, the β‐blocker prescription may change during follow‐up, so recent studies that examined long‐term survival effect according to β‐blocker prescription at discharge might have grave limitations. 9, 10 Therefore, whether β‐blocker use beyond 1 year after AMI truly reduces mortality in the current era of AMI and post‐AMI care remains inconclusive, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In low‐risk patients (preserved ejection fraction, young age, absence of arrhythmias, or residual ischemia), prolonged use of β‐blockers is unlikely to confer any mortality benefit. 11 These findings continuously raise a question to clinicians on whether to discontinue β‐blockers in low‐risk patients or to switch β‐blockers to other classes of antihypertensive agents with stronger evidence for secondary prevention of cardiovascular adverse outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to examine the late effect of β‐blockers in patients with AMI. For this purpose, the β‐blocker status and clinical characteristics of each patient were reevaluated at discharge, 1 year after AMI, and 3 years after AMI.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^117VTnAL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In 2022, ischemic heart disease, which includes CAD, accounted for the highest global cardiovascular mortality, with an age-standardized rate of 108.8 deaths per 100,000 people, underscoring its public health burden. Characterized by reduced or blocked oxygen flow to the heart, ischemic heart disease is chronic and dynamic in nature. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), arises from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion.CAD and MI incur significant health care costs, projected to surpass US$1 trillion globally by 2030.

Despite significant advancements in MI treatment, several gaps remain, particularly regarding the optimal use and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy following MI in patients with normal versus reduced heart function (ie, those with left ventricular dysfunction). While beta-blocker therapy has been a cornerstone in managing MI due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, prevent arrhythmias, and improve survival rates, its effectiveness for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or without heart failure remains unclear. Recent reviews have reported mixed findings regarding the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, and have unveiled the fact that most of the evidence suggesting its significant CV mortality and morbidity benefits was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the prereperfusion era (Central Illustration). This presents a critical gap, as current clinical guidelines are based on outdated evidence and lack data from comprehensive RCTs and real-world evidence (RWE) that accurately reflect today's diverse patient populations seen in clinical practice. There is a need for up-to-date, broader and more representative studies that provide insights into the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapyin the context of modern revascularization procedures and newer pharmacotherapies that have improved post-MI outcomes.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113RtGnG]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results support the need for further randomized control trials to better understand the role of BB use following AMI in patients with preserved LV function. Such clinical trials should be designed to resolve remaining questions regarding treatment duration, dosage, and effect modification by different types of ACS. Multiple ongoing clinical trials are aiming to help resolve these questions, including SMART-DECISION (Long-term Beta-blocker Therapy After Acute Myocardial Infarction;), REBOOT-CNIC (TREatment With Beta-blockers After myOcardial Infarction withOut Reduced Ejection fracTion;), REDUCE-SWEDEHEART (Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Betablockers After Myocardial Infarction in the SWEDEHEART Registry;), BETAMI (BEtablocker Treatment After Acute Myocardial Infarction in Patients Without Reduced Left Ventricular Systolic Function;), and DANBLOCK (Danish Trial of Beta Blocker Treatment After Myocardial Infarction Without Reduced Ejection Fraction;). Future guideline iterations incorporating the results of the currently published and ongoing observational and randomized studies should provide increased confidence in recommendations informing questions of the need for and optimal duration of BB therapy in patients with uncomplicated AMI.

Study Limitations

This was a retrospective observational study making it susceptible to bias owing to residual confounding from unmeasured covariates and treatment selection biases. We required documentation of preserved LVEF for study inclusion, which could have introduced selection bias. However, this design choice was integral to our research question. Our population was limited to the province of Alberta, Canada and may lack generalizability to different practice patterns, ethnic diversity and health care systems. Our study intentionally excluded patients who died within 180 days of their index AMI in order to address a specific question related to the long-term continuation of BB therapy in patients for whom it was newly prescribed post-AMI. This design does not permit an assessment of the impacts of duration of BB therapy shorter than 180 days and potentially adds survival bias. Whether BBs were discontinued on the advice of a physician, side effects, nonadherence, or for other reasons is unknown, and the reason for discontinuation could be related to subsequent outcomes. Typically, patients adherent to medications have higher health literacy and/or socioeconomic status with overall better health outcomes. In our study a significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in the extent of CAD and use of percutaneous coronary intervention. Though we adjusted for these variables, it is conceivable that incomplete revascularization was a driver of recurrent AMI in the early BB discontinuation group. As with all subgroup analyses, the stratified analyses based on the STEMI and NSTEMI should be considered exploratory and may represent a chance finding.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111QziV2]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this prospective, multicenter, observational study, we found a statistically significant difference between continuous beta‐blocker therapy and a reduced risk of unstable angina, recurrent MI, and MACE in patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI, and, importantly, the duration of beta‐blocker therapy is preferable to long‐term (≥ 6 months). The association between continuous beta‐blocker therapy and cardiac death was not observed in our study. The beneficial effects of continuous beta‐blocker therapy were presented in several subgroups.

A considerable number of studies exist that assess the relationship between beta‐blocker therapy and clinical outcomes in patients with MI. However, most studies have explored the relationship between the use of beta‐blockers at a particular time point and outcomes or the long‐term use of beta‐blockers and outcomes through a comparison of the clinical outcomes of patients treated or not treated with beta‐blockers. The results of their studies are also inconsistent. Concerning the duration of beta‐blocker therapy, as mentioned previously, the latest ESC guidelines did not clearly state the specific duration of beta‐blocker use in patients with AMI. In reality, due to ethical review and other factors (a small percentage of patients discontinuing beta‐blockers implies a small sample size,), randomization of beta‐blocker use or duration would be difficult to achieve. Only a very few observational studies have currently investigated the issue of the duration of beta‐blocker therapy.

A retrospective, national, cohort study (N = 28,970, median follow‐up 3.5 years) in patients without HF (defined as previous HF) after AMI, including a beta‐blocker therapy < 1‐year group and a beta‐blocker therapy ≥ 1‐year group, suggested that continued beta‐blocker therapy ≥ 1 year after MI is associated with a reduced risk of all‐cause death and a reduced risk of composite outcomes (a composite of all‐cause death, recurrent MI, or hospitalization for new HF). As mentioned by the authors of the study, no information on LVEF was included. This cohort included patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) who might have a worse prognosis despite being treated with beta‐blockers for ≥ 1 year than those without left ventricular systolic dysfunction but treated with beta‐blockers for < 1 year.

### Association of β-blockers beyond 1 year after myocardial infarction and cardiovascular outcomes [^117JAqJA]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this large nationwide cohort study, long-term BB therapy beyond the first year of MI was not associated with lower risk of CV outcomes in patients without heart failure or LVSD. The results of ongoing RCTs will provide much-needed evidence about the role of long-term BB therapy in this group of patients.

Limitations of contemporary RCTs

Even though RCTs are designed to be unbiased and are regarded as the highest level of evidence, these types of studies still have limitations. The CAPITAL, REDUCE-AMI, and ABYSS trials have several limitations which raise important considerations for future research on beta-blocker therapy following an MI and broader cardiovascular contexts. Watanabe's study, being underpowered, lacked sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences, highlighting the need for adequately powered trials to assess beta-blocker withdrawal or continuation in various patient populations. The open-label design used in these trials may have introduced potential bias, as both patients and physicians knew the treatment allocation. This may have led to treatment crossover, especially in the no-beta-blocker or interruption groups, diluting the effects of the intervention. To mitigate this, future studies should aim for double-blind designs, or at the very least, strict protocols to minimize crossover and include both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses to better capture the impact of treatment adherence and protocol deviations.

Furthermore, neither the REDUCE-AMI nor CAPITAL trial adequately addressed the effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with mid-range LVEF (40% to 50%). While the ABYSS trial included patients with LVEF ≥ 40%, its findings may not be generalizable beyond Europe due to regional differences in health care systems and clinical practices. To address this limitation, future research should consider multicenter, multicounty RCTs to provide more globally relevant results and help inform worldwide clinical guidelines on beta-blocker use after MI.

Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up duration in many RCTs, which may fail to capture long-term outcomes like recurrent angina, heart failure progression, or other cardiovascular events. Extending follow-up periods in future studies will provide better insights into the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, including its impact on mortality, recurrent events, and quality of life, particularly in diverse patient subgroups.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Continuous beta‐blocker therapy was not statistically associated with cardiac death; yet, continuous beta‐blocker therapy was associated with a reduced risk of unstable angina or recurrent MI or MACE in patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI, and could be better with long‐term therapy (≥ 6 months).

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure [^1125XUnk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction was established before the introduction of modern coronary reperfusion therapy and secondary prevention strategies.

Methods

In an open-label, randomized trial with blinded end-point evaluation, conducted in Denmark and Norway, we assigned patients who had had a myocardial infarction and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term beta-blocker therapy within 14 days after the event or no beta-blocker therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or major adverse cardiovascular events (new myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, heart failure, or malignant ventricular arrhythmias).

Results

A total of 5574 patients underwent randomization and were included in the main analyses - 2783 in the beta-blocker group and 2791 in the no-beta-blocker group. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 394 patients (14.2%) in the beta-blocker group and in 454 patients (16.3%) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Death from any cause occurred in 4.2% of the patients in the beta-blocker group and in 4.4% of those in the no-beta-blocker group; myocardial infarction occurred in 5.0% and 6.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), unplanned coronary revascularization in 3.9% and 3.9%, ischemic stroke in 1.6% and 1.3%, heart failure in 1.5% and 1.9%, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 0.5% and 0.6%. No apparent differences in safety outcomes were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with a myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, beta-blocker therapy led to a lower risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events than no beta-blocker therapy.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^116W8Nf9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 40 years have passed since the first randomized placebo‐controlled trials demonstrated a mortality benefit of β‐blockers (BBLs) after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Since that time, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the mainstay of reperfusion in ST‐segment–elevation MI (STEMI), and an early invasive strategy is routine in non–ST‐segment–elevation MI. Current generation drug‐eluting stents are standard in PCI and have low rates of restenosis and thrombosis. Statin and dual‐antiplatelet therapy are near universal; and in patients with heart failure, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors and ultimately implantable cardioverters‐defibrillators reduce mortality. Despite extensive research on the efficacy of BBLs in acute MI, there remain several unanswered questions. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review that included 63 randomized trials (n = 85 550) of BBLs versus placebo or no BBLs concluded that BBLs reduced the risk of reinfarction in the short‐term, defined as within 3 months, and all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality after that time point. However, the duration of the mortality benefit was not specified. Despite the power of the analysis, the effect of BBLs on major adverse cardiovascular events, nonfatal MI, and angina was uncertain. Remarkably, no trials reported adverse events related to BBL therapy. In an era where polypharmacy is common, adherence is a concern, and deescalation strategies are being considered to reduce untoward drug effects and cost, the optimal duration of BBLs after MI is highly relevant.

### Current use of β-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease [^112UXA61]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers have long comprised a cornerstone in the symptomatic treatment of ischemic heart disease and in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and heart failure. The majority of studies underlying the evidence of a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on outcomes were conducted more than 25 years ago. In a contemporary era where treatment strategies and secondary prophylactic therapy have undergone several changes, the continued role of beta-blockers in ischemic heart disease has been questioned, especially in the absence of heart failure or a recent myocardial infarction. In summary, few randomized clinical trials are available on the effect of beta-blockers in the reperfusion era, especially on hard endpoints. Likewise, the results of numerous observational studies and meta-analysis are conflicting, emphasizing the need for additional large-scale randomized clinical trials to evaluate the role of beta-blocker therapy in current clinical practice.

### Β-blocker use and clinical outcomes in stable outpatients with and without coronary artery disease [^1177QHaL]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

β-Blockers remain the standard of care after a myocardial infarction (MI). However, the benefit of β-blocker use in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but no history of MI, those with a remote history of MI, and those with only risk factors for CAD is unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of β-blocker use with cardiovascular events in stable patients with a prior history of MI, in those with CAD but no history of MI, and in those with only risk factors for CAD.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Longitudinal, observational study of patients in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry who were divided into 3 cohorts: known prior MI (n = 14,043), known CAD without MI (n = 12,012), or those with CAD risk factors only (n = 18,653). Propensity score matching was used for the primary analyses. The last follow-up data collection was April 2009.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. The secondary outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for atherothrombotic events or a revascularization procedure.

Results

Among the 44,708 patients, 21,860 were included in the propensity score-matched analysis. With a median follow-up of 44 months (interquartile range, 35–45 months), event rates were not significantly different in patients with β-blocker use compared with those without β-blocker use for any of the outcomes tested, even in the prior MI cohort (489 [16.93%] vs 532 [18.60%], respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.03]; p = 0.14). In the CAD without MI cohort, the associated event rates were not significantly different in those with β-blocker use for the primary outcome (391 [12.94%]) vs without β-blocker use (405 [13.55%]) (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.79–1.08]; p = 0.31), with higher rates for the secondary outcome (1101 [30.59%] vs 1002 [27.84%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.14 [95% CI, 1.03–1.27]; p = 0.01) and for the tertiary outcome of hospitalization (870 [24.17%] vs 773 [21.48%]; OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04–1.30]; p = 0.01). In the cohort with CAD risk factors only, the event rates were higher for the primary outcome with β-blocker use (467 [14.22%]) vs without β-blocker use (403 [12.11%]) (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.02–1.36]; p = 0.02), for the secondary outcome (870 [22.01%] vs 797 [20.17%]; OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.00–1.24]; p = 0.04) but not for the tertiary outcomes of MI (89 [2.82%] vs 68 [2.00%]; HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.97–1.90]; p = 0.08) and stroke (210 [6.55%] vs 168 [5.12%]; HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.99–1.52]; p = 0.06). However, in those with recent MI (≤ 1 year), β-blocker use was associated with a lower incidence of the secondary outcome (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.64–0.92]).

Conclusion

In this observational study of patients with either CAD risk factors only, known prior MI, or known CAD without MI, the use of β-blockers was not associated with a lower risk of composite cardiovascular events.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^116JjjRa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In real‐world clinical practice, more than half of the patients undergoing PCI for AMI have maintained BBs for at least 36 months. Among stable, optimally treated patients with AMI following PCI, an inverse correlation was noted between BB duration and adverse clinical outcomes. Our study demonstrated that if patients continue long‐term BB therapy for ≥ 36 months, a better prognosis could be expected in stabilized patients following MI who underwent PCI. Further randomized trials evaluating the association between the duration of BB maintenance therapy and clinical outcomes are warranted to understand the optimal period of BB therapy in stabilized patients following MI who underwent PCI.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^116h3vXe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although beta‐blockers are recommended following myocardial infarction (MI), the benefits of long‐term treatment have not been established. The study's aim was to evaluate beta‐blocker efficacy by dose in 1‐year post‐MI survivors.

Methods and Results

The OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry included 7057 patients with acute MI, with 6077 one‐year survivors. For this landmark analysis, beta‐blocker dose status was available in 3004 patients and analyzed by use (binary) and dose at 1 year after MI. Doses were classified as no beta‐blocker and > 0% to 12.5%, > 12.5% to 25%, > 25% to 50%, and > 50% of target doses used in randomized clinical trials. Age was 63 to 64 years, and approximately two thirds were men. Median follow‐up duration was 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.98–1.22). When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy was not associated with improved survival. When analyzed by dose, propensity score analysis showed significantly increased mortality in the no–beta‐blocker group (hazard ratio,1.997; 95% CI, 1.118–3.568; P < 0.02), the > 0% to 12.5% group (hazard ratio, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.094–3.016; P < 0.02), and the > 25% to 50% group (hazard ratio, 1.764; 95% CI, 1.105–2.815; P < 0.02), compared with the > 12.5% to 25% dose group. The mortality in the full‐dose group was not significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.196; 95% CI, 0.687–2.083). In subgroup analyses, only history of congestive heart failure demonstrated significant interaction with beta‐blocker effects on survival.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose used in prior randomized clinical trials beyond 1 year after MI may have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker and other beta‐blocker doses. A new paradigm for post‐MI beta‐blocker therapy is needed that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction and preserved ejection fraction [^112kxjAQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most trials that have shown a benefit of beta-blocker treatment after myocardial infarction included patients with large myocardial infarctions and were conducted in an era before modern biomarker-based diagnosis of myocardial infarction and treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention, antithrombotic agents, high-intensity statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists.

Methods

In a parallel-group, open-label trial performed at 45 centers in Sweden, Estonia, and New Zealand, we randomly assigned patients with an acute myocardial infarction who had undergone coronary angiography and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 50% to receive either long-term treatment with a beta-blocker (metoprolol or bisoprolol) or no beta-blocker treatment. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction.

Results

From September 2017 through May 2023, a total of 5020 patients were enrolled (95.4% of whom were from Sweden). The median follow-up was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.7). A primary end-point event occurred in 199 of 2508 patients (7.9%) in the beta-blocker group and in 208 of 2512 patients (8.3%) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.16; P = 0.64). Beta-blocker treatment did not appear to lead to a lower cumulative incidence of the secondary end points (death from any cause, 3.9% in the beta-blocker group and 4.1% in the no-beta-blocker group; death from cardiovascular causes, 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively; myocardial infarction, 4.5% and 4.7%; hospitalization for atrial fibrillation, 1.1% and 1.4%; and hospitalization for heart failure, 0.8% and 0.9%). With regard to safety end points, hospitalization for bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, hypotension, syncope, or implantation of a pacemaker occurred in 3.4% of the patients in the beta-blocker group and in 3.2% of those in the no-beta-blocker group; hospitalization for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 0.6% and 0.6%, respectively; and hospitalization for stroke in 1.4% and 1.8%.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent early coronary angiography and had a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (≥ 50%), long-term beta-blocker treatment did not lead to a lower risk of the composite primary end point of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction than no beta-blocker use.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^115K9d8X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analyses revealed a consistently lower risk of the primary outcome in patients continuing BBL therapy for ≥ 36 months, with a suggestion of even greater risk reduction in those aged ≥ 65 years and with diabetes. The mean ejection fraction in the cohort was 55%, with only 8.3% of patients at < 40%. However, there emerged a trend toward greater benefit of longer‐term BBL use in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, which is supported by clinical trials and guidelines. Several important observations of practice patterns emerged in subgroups of patients with MI, including a treatment paradox with shorter duration of BBL use in patients at higher risk for recurrent ischemic events, including older age, diabetes, previous stroke, and chronic kidney disease. In addition, those on BBLs for ≥ 36 months were more often on dual‐antiplatelet therapy, statins, and renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors for ≥ 36 months, suggesting an overall more aggressive approach to secondary prevention in this cohort. Differences in aspirin and statin were adjusted for in the analysis, and the benefit of longer‐term BBL use was observed in patients with and without concomitant renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors in the subgroup analysis. Extended duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year reduces rates of MI, but not all‐cause or cardiovascular mortality, which were the main benefits observed with long‐term BBL therapy. Although appropriate statistics were used to minimize treatment bias and more closely resemble a randomized trial, the survival benefit of those treated with long‐term BBLs may be confounded by unmeasured patient factors, such as better overall health status and the ability to tolerate and adhere to medications for secondary prevention that risk adjustment cannot account for.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^111vhuaa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

For decades, BB therapy has long been a cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for all patients with AMI. However, its role in secondary prevention following MI has been questioned in the contemporary reperfusion era. Moreover, current guidelines also did not clearly address the role of chronic BB therapy and its optimal duration in stabilized patients after AMI. The 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline for secondary cardiovascular preventionencouraged BB therapy beyond 3 years as chronic therapy in all patients, including patients with preserved LVEF who have had MI, as a class IIa recommendation. More recently, the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology STEMIand 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndromeguidelines recommended BB therapy for all patients without contraindications regardless of LVEF or HF with class I indication. However, long‐term BB therapy in patients with normal LVEF after non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndrome served as a class IIa recommendation. European Society of Cardiology guidelines acknowledged the lack of evidence for long‐term BB therapy, advocating initiation of BB treatment without mentioning the optimal duration of BB therapy. The 2017 European Society of Cardiology STEMIand 2020 non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndromeguidelines conferred a class IIa recommendation in patients without HF and preserved LVEF for the use of routine BB therapy in both the acute and chronic phases. Furthermore, evidence of BB therapy of current guidelines was primarily based on old trials when reperfusion therapy (eg, stent implantation) was not widespread, and GDMT, such as dual antiplatelets and high‐intensity statins, was unavailable.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^112cVD1Y]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In survivors of uncomplicated AMI with preserved LVEF, discontinuation of BB before 180 days was not associated with increased risk the composite outcome of death, recurrent AMI, or repeat coronary revascularization. However, early BB discontinuation was associated with increased risks of recurrent AMI and repeat revascularization, with a suggestion that these associations may be stronger in those with STEMI compared with NSTEMI as the index presentation. Randomized trials testing durations of BB therapy after AMI should be designed to examine differences between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI and focus on patients with preserved LVEF.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In survivors of uncomplicated AMI with preserved LV function, whether long-term BB therapy improves outcomes has been unclear. In this observational study, discontinuation of BBs before 180 days was not associated with increased risk the composite outcome of death, recurrent AMI, or repeat coronary revascularization over 5 years of follow-up. However, BB discontinuation was associated with increased risks of recurrent MI and repeat revascularization, with a suggestion that these associations may be stronger in those with STEMI compared with NSTEMI as the index presentation.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: The need for ongoing BB therapy should be individualized in follow-up for patients with preserved LV function following MI. In the absence of angina, heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, many patients may be able to safely discontinue this therapy.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Randomized trials testing durations of BB therapy after MI should be designed to examine differences between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI and focus on patients with preserved LV function.

### Long-term use of cardiovascular drugs: challenges for research and for patient care [^115TNZfd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Little is known about the benefits and risks of the long-term use of cardiovascular drugs. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) rarely goes beyond a few years of follow-up, but patients are often given continuous treatment with multiple drugs well into old age. We focus on 4 commonly used cardiovascular drug classes: aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors given to patients after myocardial infarction. However, the issues raised apply more broadly to all long-term medications across cardiovascular diseases and the whole of medicine. The evidence and limitations of RCTs are addressed, as well as current practice in pre-licensing trials, the increasing problems of polypharmacy (especially in the elderly), the lack of trial evidence for withdrawal of drugs, the role of regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in this challenging situation, and the potential educational solutions for the medical profession. We conclude with a set of recommendations on how to improve the situation of long-term drug use.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112WcAtY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

For patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), long‐term beta‐blocker (BB) therapy is widespread, with the expectation of its beneficial effects on improving quality of life and reducing death. Nevertheless, there is a debate that the absolute magnitude of the benefit from long‐term BB therapy in patients with AMI might be reduced in the contemporary era due to the widespread use of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reperfusion therapies.

The current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology provide recommendations for BB use in patients with AMI. However, it is important to note that these guidelines do not provide clear answers for the usefulness of long‐term BB therapy or the optimal duration of BB therapy following AMI, given the absence of randomized controlled trials and inconsistent results of observational registries, which results in a gap in the evidence. Furthermore, the evidence supporting the benefit of BBs was obtained primarily from studies in the pre‐reperfusion era that were performed without the routine use of GDMT. To date, no study has adequately addressed the association between long‐term BB therapy and clinical outcomes in stabilized patients following myocardial infarction (MI) because they examined outcomes on the basis of whether BBs were prescribed at a particular time with the assumption that patients who took BBs at a specific time would still be on BB therapy thereafter. Moreover, data on the beneficial effect of BB use over 36 months in stabilized patients following MI are scarce.

Therefore, whether BBs should be maintained indefinitely or whether there exists an appropriate time when it can be discontinued in stabilized patients following MI has not been well established. In this study, we sought to (1) compare the clinical benefits of long‐term BB maintenance therapy stratified by the duration of BB use and (2) evaluate the efficacy of BB therapy beyond 36 months in stable, optimally treated patients with AMI undergoing PCI using a contemporary nationwide Korean AMI registry.

### Beta-blockers for suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction [^111xoJvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization, 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart diseases in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Acute myocardial infarction is caused by blockage of the blood supplied to the heart muscle. Beta-blockers are often used in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results ranging from harms, neutral effects, to benefits. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of beta-blockers for acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention in people with suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded and BIOSIS Citation Index in June 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Turning Research into Practice, Google Scholar, SciSearch, and the reference lists of included trials and previous reviews in August 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention in people with suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction. Trials were included irrespective of trial design, setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of our outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed the Cochrane methodological recommendations. Four review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction during follow-up). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. Our primary time point of interest was less than three months after randomisation. We also assessed the outcomes at maximum follow-up beyond three months. Due to risk of multiplicity, we calculated a 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcomes and a 98% CI for the secondary outcomes. We assessed the risks of systematic errors through seven bias domains in accordance to the instructions given in the Cochrane Handbook. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed by GRADE.

Main Results

We included 63 trials randomising a total of 85,550 participants (mean age 57.4 years). Only one trial was at low risk of bias. The remaining trials were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence according to GRADE ranged from very low to high. Fifty-six trials commenced beta-blockers during the acute phase of acute myocardial infarction and seven trials during the subacute phase. At our primary time point 'less than three months follow-up', meta-analysis showed that beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risk of a reinfarction during follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 98% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.91; 67,562 participants; 18 trials; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.5% and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 196 participants. However, we found little or no effect of beta-blockers when assessing all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 97.5% CI 0.90 to 1.00; 80,452 participants; 46 trials/47 comparisons; high-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.4% and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 45,852 participants; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.4%. Regarding angina, it is uncertain whether beta-blockers have a beneficial or harmful effect (RR 0.70, 98% CI 0.25 to 1.84; 98 participants; 3 trials; very low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 7.1%. None of the trials specifically assessed nor reported serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP. Only two trials specifically assessed major adverse cardiovascular events, however, no major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in either trial. At maximum follow-up beyond three months, meta-analyses showed that beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.93, 97.5% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 25,210 participants; 21 trials/22 comparisons; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.1% and a NNTB of 91 participants, and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 98% CI 0.83 to 0.98; 22,457 participants; 14 trials/15 comparisons; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% and a NNTB of 83 participants. However, it is uncertain whether beta-blockers have a beneficial or harmful effect when assessing major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 0.81, 97.5% CI 0.40 to 1.66; 475 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.7%; reinfarction (RR 0.89, 98% CI 0.75 to 1.08; 6825 participants; 14 trials; low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.9%; and angina (RR 0.64, 98% CI 0.18 to 2.0; 844 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). None of the trials specifically assessed nor reported serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP. None of the trials assessed quality of life. We identified two ongoing randomised clinical trials investigating the effect of early administration of beta-blockers after percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis to patients with an acute myocardial infarction and one ongoing trial investigating the effect of long-term beta-blocker therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Our present review indicates that beta-blockers for suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction probably reduce the short-term risk of a reinfarction and the long-term risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Nevertheless, it is most likely that beta-blockers have little or no effect on the short-term risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Regarding all remaining outcomes (serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction during follow-up), the long-term risk of a reinfarction during follow-up, quality of life, and angina), further information is needed to confirm or reject the clinical effects of beta-blockers on these outcomes for people with or suspected of acute myocardial infarction.

### Drug therapy for prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction [^1131Kqve]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based overview of drug treatment for long-term secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI).

Data Sources

We conducted searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and the reference list of each identified study.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Trials and meta-analyses were included using the following criteria: (1) randomized trials, (2) description of identification procedure, inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and statistical methods, (3) confirmed MIs, (4) treatment continued for at least 1 month, and (5) all-cause mortality as primary outcome; other events as secondary outcomes. All authors interpreted the results from trials that met the inclusion criteria.

Data Synthesis

In randomized clinical trials, low-dose aspirin, high-intensity oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins decreased the risk of mortality and reinfarction after MI. Randomized clinical trials using calcium-channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, and hormone replacement therapy did not show benefits in patients with prior MI. Effects of the combined use of aspirin or oral anticoagulants with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors plus statins must be derived from subgroup analysis of trials, but seem to be beneficial.

Conclusions

The use of at least aspirin or an oral anticoagulant, a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor, plus a statin should be incorporated in the treatment routine. Clopidogrel treatment might be an alternative to aspirin. Standard addition of a beta-blocker to ACE inhibitor-treated patients without reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction seems to be untimely.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^113bqgHy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal dosing of BBL therapy after MI in the contemporary era is another unanswered question. The dosing of BBL was not collected in the Cardiovascular Risk and Identification of Potential High‐Risk Population in Acute Myocardial Infarction registry, and the interaction of dose and duration on outcomes after MI is unknown. The only contemporary randomized controlled trial of BBL versus placebo that investigated outcomes past 3 years was in a selected group of patients with MI, those with STEMI undergoing primary PCI who had normal ejection fraction. In the study, 801 patients were enrolled and the BBL was carvedilol. The intended dose titration was to 20 mg/d; however, dosing was at the discretion of the physician and averaged only 6.3 mg/d at 1 year. The trial failed to show a benefit of BBL on the primary outcome, which was a composite of all‐cause death, MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. Although the low dose of BBLs may have influenced the potential therapeutic effect, several national registries suggest that patients after MI are treated with BBL doses well below the target range of earlier randomized trials. In addition, several nonrandomized studies supported the use of BBL over no BBL but failed to demonstrate a greater effect of high‐ compared with low‐dose therapy, with low dose defined as either < 25% or 50% of the target dose, depending on the study. In the OBTAIN registry, in fact, the lowest mortality was found with 25% of the target dose.

Circling back to the optimal duration of BBL therapy after MI, this rigorously adjusted analysis adds evidence that maintenance therapy beyond 36 months is associated with lower mortality. A review of landmark analyses from large national registries evaluating benefits of long‐term use of BBLs after acute MI, however, shows conflicting results, with several showing no difference in mortality or composite outcomes (Table). So, how can the results be so divergent? Although these observational trials provide a window into real‐world practices and outcomes, differences in patient populations, BBL cardioselectivity and dosing, analytic techniques, and unmeasured confounders exist. Ultimately, evidence from ongoing adequately powered randomized trials is required to make definitive recommendations.

Results

A total of 1,503 people were included (732 without angina or HF, 771 with angina or HF), which represented approximately 5.86 million (95% CI: 5.29–6.43 million) people after weighting: 2.79 million (95% CI: 2.48–3.11 million) without angina or HF, 3.07 million (95% CI: 2.69–3.44 million) with angina or HF.

Among individuals without angina or HF, beta-blocker use was 53.0% (227,126/428,776; 95% CI: 38.7%-67.0%) for those 0 to 1 year from MI (Figure 1). This rate increased to 64.0% (213,306/333,195; 95% CI: 52.8%-75.2%) among those 2 to 3 years from MI (adjusted OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.85, compared to 0–1 year) and then decreased to 56.3% (191,138/339,616; 95% CI: 42.5%-70.1%) at 4 to 5 years (P = 0.56, compared to 0–1 year), and subsequently remained stable afterward (P > 0.05 for rate in all subsequent time intervals, compared to 0–1 year). Among those with angina or HF, beta-blocker use was 69.1% (266,374/385,710; 95% CI: 57.1%-81.0%) among those 0 to 1 year from MI, which remained stable as years from MI increased.

Timeline and Traffic Light Summary of Randomized Controlled Trials Assessing the Association Between Beta-Blocker Therapy With Mortality and Morbidity

The timeline illustrates included randomized controlled trials during the prereperfusion and reperfusion eras, with a traffic light color coding indicating the type of association between beta-blocker therapy and patient outcomes. The timeline highlights how evidence has evolved over time with the introduction of new treatments and shifts in patient populations, offering insights into the changing clinical context and treatment efficacy. RCTs = randomized controlled trials.

In summary, although beta-blocker therapy has long been a mainstay in post-MI management, several gaps remain in both evidence and practice. Variability in results from studies conducted during the reperfusion era underscores the need for further research. This review aims to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy across both the prereperfusion and reperfusion eras, highlighting the conflicting results reported in studies from the reperfusion era and appraising possible reasons behind these variations. This state-of-the-art review was informed by a comprehensive search of current literaturefor clinical guidelines on post-MI management in the United States, Europe, and Australia, as well as the largest and most influential RCTs from both eras that have played a fundamental role in shaping and revising clinical guidelines. Additionally, the review includes RWE studies from 2014 onward to represent the current clinical setting. Given the controversial and rapidly growing nature of this field, a limited number of observational studies are included in this review.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^111m8zCj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of beta-blocker therapy

Outpatient drug prescription data prior to and following the index hospitalization were determined using the Pharmaceutical Information Network database. Dispensations for all commercially available BBs from 1 year prior to admission to 6 years after discharge from the index hospitalization were determined for all patients. BB prescriptions dispensed between 7 days before to 30 days after discharge were considered as new if they did not have a dispensation in the 1 year prior to admission. BB dosing was assessed at index discharge, 180 days, and 365 days, and classified as low, medium, or high according to equivalent mean metoprolol SR daily dose (low = < 50 mg, med = −50 to ≤ 125 mg, and high = ≥ 125 mg). Patients were classified as early BB discontinuation if their last BB prescription ended within 180 days of discharge and as standard BB treatment if treatment persisted beyond 180 days. Since early BB prescription post-MI was universally recommended in the absence of contraindications during the study period, the 180-day threshold was used for our landmark analysis to ensure that all patients were deemed BB-eligible by their attending cardiologists during the index AMI hospitalization and most would have had the opportunity for post-AMI cardiology follow-up, with the assumption that prescriptions extending beyond that time were intended to continue long-term. This design strives to emulate a clinical trial of short- vs long-duration BB use post-MI similar in design to the ABYSS trial and avoids some pitfalls of observational research including immortal time bias and failure to align start of follow-up, specification of eligibility, and treatment assignment.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, recurrent AMI, or repeat coronary revascularization. Recurrent AMI was defined as a hospital discharge for STEMI, NSTEMI, or AMI unspecified based on a validated approach using the most-responsible diagnosis from the Discharge Abstract Database (Supplemental Table 1). Repeat coronary revascularization was defined as any percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, identified from APPROACH. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of this composite.

### Association of β-blockers beyond 1 year after myocardial infarction and cardiovascular outcomes [^117KeqFk]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide cohort study of patients who survived MI beyond 1 year, we included 43 618 patients without heart failure or LVSD 1 year after first MI and found that long-term BB therapy was not associated with improved CV outcomes during median follow-up of 4.5 years. These findings were consistent across individual secondary endpoints and across patient subgroups.

The results of our study address an existing gap in the current evidence and provide an insight into long-term optimal secondary prevention strategies for a large proportion of MI survivors, namely patients with no heart failure or LVSD who may have longer survival compared with those who develop such complications after an MI. As such, understanding the association between long-term BB use and CV outcomes in this group of patients has important implications in determining health policies and developing Clinical Practice Guidelines, but also has an impact on patients' health-related quality of life and compliance with other CV preventive therapies.

Following MI, heart failure is a major determinant of long-term morbidity and mortality for which several prognostic therapies including BB have been shown to improve outcomes. While Clinical Practice Guidelines state that it is reasonable to initiate and continue BB therapy following MI in patients without heart failure or LVSD, these recommendations are based on RCTs that predate the reperfusion and potent antiplatelets era. The current clinical practice of routine long-term use of BB is based on historical data which might not be extrapolated to patients with MI without heart failure or LVSD. As such, recent Clinical Practice Guidelines for myocardial revascularisation have questioned the routine use of chronic BB in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.

Here we present the largest study evaluating BB therapy in patients without heart failure or LVSD following MI. Among 43 618 patients, long-term BB therapy was not associated with improved CV outcomes. Until recently, no RCT had tested the efficacy of BB on long-term CV outcomes among patients with MI without heart failure or LVSD. In a contemporary small RCT, patients with STEMI without heart failure or LVSD were randomised to long-term carvedilol therapy or placebo. The trial reported that BB had no beneficial effect on CV outcomes. However, this RCT was underpowered and employed an open-label approach. In addition, the study included only a subset of MI patients thus limiting the generalisability of the results.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^114FbEm1]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, a large retrospective study of 28,970 patients suggested early discontinuation of BB had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, hospitalization, and heart failure. A 2021 Cochrane review including 25 trials suggested that BB may reduce the risk of mortality, recurrent ACS, and angina in post-AMI patients without heart failure, but the authors noted low to moderate certainty of the results. The majority of recent studies reporting benefits of longer-term BB therapy have defined their cohorts based on the absence of heart failure but without a requirement to document normal LVEF. Overall, studies on this topic have yielded mixed results and do not support a clear consensus to continue BB in the long-term in stable post-MI patients with preserved LV systolic function. The optimal duration of BB use also remains unclear. Studies that report a mortality benefit have varying results from 30 daysto over 1 year of BB use. Many of these studies report limitations in monitoring longitudinal prescriptions. Benefits of BB can be potentially underestimated if prescriptions are not filled or if patients are nonadherent. Our study of 4,768 patients provides longitudinal prescription data over the follow-up period.

An interesting finding of our analysis is the potential for increased risks of recurrent AMI and revascularization with BB discontinuation, in particular among people with a STEMI as their index event. Patients in the early discontinuation group in the STEMI subgroup of our cohort had higher frequency of recurrent AMI and need for repeat revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention compared to the BB continuation group (adjusted HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2–2.3; P = 0.004) and adjusted HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1–2.0; P = 0.01, respectively), suggesting that they may be a group with a higher risk of recurrent ischemia who might benefit from BB. It is possible that incomplete revascularization was a more common contributing factor to recurrent AMI in patients with STEMI. Additionally, patients with NSTEMI tend to have more comorbidities, atherosclerotic disease, and history of prior MI and coronary revascularization than those with STEMI suggesting they have a different phenotype that responds differently to BB. It is unlikely that less intensive use of other medical therapies explains differences between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI, as this was not observed in our study. Neither the REDUCE AMI nor ABYSS trials observed differential effects of BB therapy on their primary outcome according to AMI subtype.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^116KEbyj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of routine beta-blocker (BB) use after uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with contemporary therapies is not well established.

Objectives

The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked registry and administrative data to evaluate whether early BB discontinuation (a prescription ending within 180 days of discharge) is associated with clinical outcomes.

Methods

We included patients who survived at least 180 days after AMI from 2008 to 2017 with new BB prescription and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%. The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent AMI, myocardial revascularization, or all-cause mortality within 5 years. Secondary outcomes were each of the components of the composite. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between early BB discontinuation and outcomes.

Results

Among the 4,768 included patients, 1,155 (24.2%) discontinued BB within 180 days of AMI discharge. During a median follow-up time of 57 months, 964 patients (20.2%) experienced the primary outcome. Early BB discontinuation was not associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.94–1.26), or with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.86–1.26). However, early BB discontinuation was associated with an increased risk for recurrent AMI and a higher rate of repeat revascularization.

Conclusions

In patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction after AMI, discontinuation of BB within 180 days was not associated with a significantly increased risk of a composite outcome of death, recurrent AMI, or revascularization but was associated with increased risk of recurrent AMI and need for repeat revascularization.

Perioperative beta-blocker continuation and withdrawal — observational outcomes show that selective discontinuation increased myocardial infarction (MI) risk in the first 30 days (relative risk [RR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 6.89) and between 30 and 180 days (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.59); in a retrospective cohort of 140 preoperative beta-blocked patients, postoperative discontinuation in 8 patients was associated with 50% mortality versus 1.5% when continued (odds ratio [OR] 65.0; p < 0.001); and in 711 peripheral vascular surgery patients, continuous use was associated with lower 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7), whereas withdrawal increased 1-year mortality (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.9). The guideline notes that "perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal should be avoided unless necessary", and that continuation in the perioperative period "is a Class I indication", with titration to maintain heart rate control while avoiding frank hypotension and bradycardia as the goal.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^117WZrrz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite convincing evidence that BB therapy is beneficial for short‐term outcomes, it is unclear whether long‐term maintenance BB therapy is helpful in patients following MI treated with PCI because previous studies showed conflicting results, and no study has adequately addressed the association between BB duration and clinical outcomes. In the current PCI era, several observational studies examined the long‐term effect of BB therapy in patients with AMI on the basis of whether BBs were prescribed at specific time points, such as at discharge,1 year, or 3 years. However, there are limitations to merit a mention in these studies. First, the results of previous studies could not represent the role of long‐term maintenance BB therapy on clinical outcomes in patients following MI because evaluating long‐term outcomes according to BB use at a particular time point is based on the large assumption that all patients receiving BBs at a specific time point will maintain BBs without discontinuation thereafter. Most previous studies did not provide data on whether BBs were continued until the end of follow‐up. However, BB discontinuation is not uncommon, and BB prescription rates have significantly changed during follow‐up after MI, ranging from 10% to 50% up to 3 years after MI, as previous studies have reported. Second, the results of previous studies could not represent contemporary AMI practice; that is, only < 60% of patients with AMI received PCI, and there was no information on drug‐eluting stent use. The CAPITAL‐RCT (Carvedilol Post‐Intervention Long‐Term Administration in Large‐Scale Randomized Controlled Trial), which was the only randomized controlled trial investigating the role of long‐term BB therapy in STEMI patients who underwent primary PCI, did not show any protective effect of long‐term (median, 3.9 years) carvedilol on death. However, this trial has several limitations that make it difficult to draw a definite conclusion about the efficacy of long‐term BB use in patients following MI, such as the relatively small sample size (801 patients), low event rate, exclusively conducted in patients with normal LVEF (mean LVEF in each group was ≈60%), and a low maintenance dose of carvedilol (6.3 mg/day at 1 year). In addition, a registry study based on Korean nationwide medical insurance data reported that persistent BB therapy beyond 3 years in patients who were event free for 3 years after the index MI was associated with reduced risks of a composite of all‐cause death, recurrent MI, or hospitalization for HF. However, this study also has several significant limitations that make it difficult to draw a robust conclusion. First, the study population may not reflect the current practice because patients not continuing BB therapy took GDMT less frequently. Second, the provided information is limited to the type of AMI, angiographic and procedural findings, patients' clinical characteristics at presentation, or LVEF. In the present study, we assess long‐term adverse clinical outcomes in relation to the duration of BB therapy in stabilized, optimally treated patients following MI who successfully underwent PCI with drug‐eluting stent. To evaluate the efficacy of long‐term maintenance BB therapy in the chronic phase after MI, we exclusively included stabilized patients who were 3 months event‐free from death or cardiovascular events and who continued BB therapy without disruption. The enrolled patients in our study showed excellent adherence to GDMT, such as antiplatelet agents, statin, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor use, up to 3 years following the index MI (Table S3). Additionally, we applied rigorous statistical methods such as PS‐weighed analyses using MMWS to minimize confounding bias and performed a 3‐year landmark analysis to demonstrate the beneficial effect of long‐term maintenance BB therapy over 36 months. The results of the present study will provide new insights to fill the gap in the evidence for the usefulness of long‐term maintenance BB therapy or the optimal duration of BB therapy for patients with AMI following PCI.

### Pharmacological treatment following myocardial infarction: how large is the gap between guideline recommendations and routine clinical care? [^111bNSTM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

By now, more than one decade has passed since publication of guideline‐relevant landmark studies investigating the prognostic role of important pharmacotherapies (ie, beta blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [MRA]) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. However, because of improvement of the nationwide healthcare supply, revascularization strategies of coronary artery disease, and increasing supply of invasive cardiac devices (such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy), mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have significantly decreased. As a consequence, characteristics and comorbidities of patients admitted to hospital have changed, leading to a higher number of older patients with increasing rates of progressive heart failure, complex coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Curiously, whether one of these established pharmacotherapies may still affect prognosis in patients with current complex heart failure syndromes has not yet been reevaluated within further randomized controlled trials. Therefore, European guidelines demand registry data to reassess the prognostic impact of established pharmacotherapies nowadays. To further close this gap in literature, Goldberger et al and Wong et al investigated the prognostic impact of beta blockers and their appropriate dose, as well as the current use and guideline adherence of MRA treatment in patients with AMI within this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA). Goldberger et al analyzed retrospectively more than 3,000 patients originally enrolled in the OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry (2007–2011) using propensity score matched cohorts. They demonstrated lowest mortality rates in the presence of beta blocker intake of at least 12.5% to 25% of recommended target dosages at a median follow‐up of one year. Their findings are in line with results from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web‐System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry (2006–2015) demonstrating target dosages at more than 50% than recommended were not associated with improved freedom from re‐infarction or all‐cause mortality. Despite the utmost importance of the findings by Goldberger and colleagues further studies will be necessary to provide robust data on the best duration of beta blocker therapy, especially in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The common indications for heart failure pharmacotherapies are based on the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and patients' symptoms. However, one may wonder whether this still appropriate in the complex heart failure patient with different underlying aetiologies and multi‐modal treatments.

### Clinical events after discontinuation of β-blockers in patients without heart failure optimally treated after acute myocardial infarction: a cohort study on the French healthcare databases [^115sf8Be]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

β-blockers have been among the first medications shown to improve outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). With the advent of reperfusion therapy and other secondary-prevention medications, their role has become uncertain, and large-scale experience after AMI in the contemporary era is lacking. In particular, the effect of stopping β-blockers in patients initially treated after AMI is unknown.

Methods and Results

Using the French healthcare databases, 73450 patients (< 80 years of age), admitted for AMI in 2007 to 2012, without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the previous 2 years and no evidence of heart failure, having received optimal treatment with myocardial revascularization and all recommended medications in the 4 months after index admission, and not having discontinued β-blockers before 1 year, were followed for 3.8 years on average. β-Blocker discontinuation was defined as 4 consecutive months without exposure. If β-blocker treatment was resumed later on, follow-up was stopped. Both the risk of the composite outcome of death or admission for ACS and the risk of all-cause mortality were assessed in relation with β-blocker discontinuation during follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using marginal structural models accounting for time-varying confounders affected by previous exposure. A similar analysis was performed with statins. Of 204592 patient-years, 12002 (5.9%) corresponded to discontinued β-blocker treatment. For β-blocker discontinuation, the adjusted hazard ratio for death or ACS was 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.35); for all-cause death, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.36). In contrast, for statin discontinuation, the adjusted hazard ratios for death or ACS and for all-cause death were 2.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.01–2.65) and 2.57 (95% confidence interval, 2.19–3.02), respectively.

Conclusions

In routine care of patients without heart failure, revascularized and optimally treated after AMI, discontinuation of β-blockers beyond 1 year after AMI was associated with an increased risk of death or readmission for ACS, while statistical significance was not reached for the association with all-cause mortality. A contemporary randomized clinical trial is needed to precise the role of β-blockers in the long-term treatment after AMI.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^117Dmzpa]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Similarly, another large‐scale cohort study (N = 73,450, median follow‐up 3.8 years), designed to explore the effects of stopping beta‐blockers in patients without HF after AMI, divided the patients according to beta‐blocker use, and the results suggested that discontinuation of beta‐blockers beyond 1 year was related to an increased risk of all‐cause death or readmission for the acute coronary syndrome, while statistical significance was not reached for the association with all‐cause death. Regulatory information on LVEF was also unfortunately not available for this study. In addition, the findings of this study cannot be generalized to the first year because follow‐up began 1 year after the AMI index.

Both of the above studies examined differences in outcomes in patients treated with beta‐blockers for ≥ 1 year versus those treated with beta‐blockers for < 1 year, and both suggest that long‐term treatment with beta‐blockers might be beneficial in patients without HF after AMI, although not both suggested improvement in all‐cause death. LVEF < 40% or LVEF ≥ 40% is an indispensable criterion for assessing beta‐blocker therapy as recommended by the latest ESC Guidelines in patients with AMI without HF. Our study focused on the shorter duration of discontinuation of beta‐blocker therapy (< 6 months) and included information on LVEF. The results suggest a statistically significant association between continuous beta‐blocker therapy (≥ 6 months) and better outcomes. Beta‐blocker therapy should probably be longer than 6 months in patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI. The present study might be able to add to the results of the large‐scale cohort study described above.

In our study, a lower proportion of no‐beta‐blocker therapy patients underwent PCI, which may be explained by a greater proportion of such patients being older than 75 years, a greater proportion with previous comorbid CAD, a greater incidence of inferior/posterior MI, and more unstable blood pressure, resulting in a lower willingness to undergo PCI, poorer revascularization, and less prescription of beta‐blockers and ACEI/ARB/ARNI.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^114jbBcB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

New‐Generation β‐Blockers

Despite the extensive use of β‐blockers in patients after AMI, data on their benefits are derived from old studies 5, 19 or extrapolated from studies on chronic angina and heart failure. 8, 26 Therefore, data on the long‐term effect of newer generations of β‐blockers, such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, and carvedilol, are limited, which may have different properties and distinct effects from those of the first‐generation β‐blockers (ie, propranolol or timolol). In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, only long‐acting metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol have proven survival benefits, which indicates that the protective effect of β‐blockers is not a "class effect", as seen in angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. 7, 27, 28 In this study, 70% and 27% received third‐generation carvedilol and second‐generation bisoprolol, respectively, and our study results did not demonstrate different efficacies in patients with AMI, as reported in previous studies. 13, 29

Switch of β‐Blockers to RAS Inhibitors

After 1 year, hypertension became an important risk factor of long‐term mortality in this study, and the use of RAS inhibitors at 1 or 3 years showed a significant survival benefit. β‐Blockers are not recommended as the first‐line therapy for management of hypertension because of their inferior efficacy to that of RAS inhibitors. 30, 31 RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, exert pleiotropic effects and reduce oxidative stress, cardiovascular fibrosis, and vascular and cardiac muscle hypertrophies, 32 independently of their blood pressure–lowering property. Whether β‐blockers should be switched to other classes of antihypertensive agents in patients with hypertension 1 year after AMI or later should be confirmed in further clinical trials.

For the present study, patients treated with continuous beta‐blockers accounted for 93.0% (1001/1076) of the included patients, and the proportion of patients treated with beta‐blockers for < 6 months was 7.0% (75/1076). And, we obtained the reasons associated with 68 discontinuous patients (68/75, 90.7%) from healthcare data and telephone contacts, of which 65 were discontinued for their reasons (e.g. unawareness of the need for long‐term medication after MI, fear of adverse drug reactions, isolation for epidemic reasons, etc.) and 3 were discontinued due to new‐onset disease or slow heart rate.

Beta blockers after revascularization — In patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and normal left ventricular function after complete revascularization, routine chronic oral beta blockers are classified as no benefit and the recommendation states that "the routine use of chronic oral beta blockers is not beneficial to reduce cardiovascular events after complete revascularization", with supportive text noting a meta-analysis showing "no differences in adjusted rates of death, MI, stroke, or revascularization but a higher rate of heart failure readmissions" and registry data where beta-blocker use "was not associated with a reduction in the composite cardiovascular outcome"; accordingly, "the decision to continue beta blockers in the long term in patients after revascularization should be made on an individualized basis".

All-cause mortality

Contemporary evidence from RCTs indicates no association between using beta-blocker therapy and reduced all-cause mortality (Table 1). For example, a post hoc analysis from the CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) trial found that beta-blocker therapy in patients with previous MI, but no heart failure, did not affect mortality rates (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.52–1.14). Similarly, the CAPITAL-RCT (Carvedilol Post-Intervention Long-Term Administration in Large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial) with a median follow-up of 3.9 years, reported no significant difference in the 3-year incidences of composite outcomes including all-cause mortality, MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for ACS between the carvedilol group and no beta-blocker therapy group (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.47–1.16). Moreover, there was no significant difference in LVEF at 1 year between the 2 groups.

The findings from the recently published REDUCE-AMI (Randomised Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-blockers After Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, a pragmatic RCT involving patients from Sweden, Estonia, and New Zealand who underwent revascularization and had an LVEF ≥ 50% after acute MI, found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between those who received beta-blocker therapy and those who did not (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.79–1.16). This trial is the first to provide insights specifically on patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 50%). However, the ABYSS (Assessment of β-blocker interruption 1 Year after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization) trial, a noninferiority study conducted in France, found that interrupting beta-blocker therapy 1 year after an uncomplicated MI did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome (death, recurrent MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events) over a median follow-up of 3 years (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01–1.33; P = 0.44 for noninferiority). In addition, the trial reported that the interruption of beta-blocker therapy did not result in an improvement in quality of life.

### Β blockers after myocardial infarction with mildly reduced ejection fraction: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111daV4Y]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of β-blocker therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced (40–49%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are largely unknown. Four recently conducted randomised trials tested the efficacy of β blockers after a recent myocardial infarction in patients without reduced LVEF (LVEF ≥ 40%). However, none were individually powered to assess these effects in the subgroup of patients with mildly reduced LVEF. We aimed to assess the efficacy of β blockers in patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced LVEF during the index hospitalisation.

Methods

We conducted an individual patient-level meta-analysis of patients with mildly reduced LVEF and no history or signs of heart failure from four recent clinical trials. These studies were included because they were randomised controlled trials testing long-term effects (median follow-up > 1 year) of oral β-blocker therapy in patients who recently had a myocardial infarction (randomisation within 14 days) and had mildly reduced LVEF. No further studies were found in a systematic review (Jan 1, 2020 to June 26, 2025). A one-stage, fixed-effects, Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the treatment effect of β blockers on the predefined primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, new myocardial infarction, or heart failure. All endpoints were independently adjudicated. This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251023480).

Findings

1885 patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced LVEF were included in the meta-analysis: 979 from the REBOOT trial, 422 from the BETAMI trial, 430 from the DANBLOCK trial, and 54 from the CAPITAL-RCT trial. Overall, 991 patients were assigned to β blockers and 894 to control (no β blockers). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 106 patients (32.6 events per 1000 patient-years) in the β-blocker group and 129 patients (43.0 per 1000 patient-years) in the no β-blocker group (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.58–0.97]; p = 0.031). No heterogeneity between the trials (trial-by-treatment p interaction = 0.95) or between countries of enrolment was observed (p interaction = 0.98).

Interpretation

In patients with acute myocardial infarction with mildly reduced LVEF without history or clinical signs of heart failure, β-blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in the composite of all-cause death, new myocardial infarction, or heart failure. These results extend the known benefits of these agents in patients with myocardial infarction with reduced LVEF to the subgroup with mildly reduced LVEF.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider reassessing the indication for long-term (> 1 year) use of β-blockers for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease on β-blocker therapy for previous myocardial infarction without a history of or current LVEF ≤ 50%, angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^111vxBL4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain the improved outcomes associated with BB therapy after MI. These include (1) anti‐ischemic effects by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and preventing reinfarction; (2) improvement of left ventricular structure and function; (3) antihypertensive effects; (4) reduction of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone release and preventing ventricular remodeling; and (5) antiarrhythmic effect and reduction in arrhythmia‐related sudden death. In particular, the last 3 mechanisms are vital to improving prognosis, even in stabilized patients, following MI.

Finally, despite adopting strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and advanced statistics used in this study to overcome the inherent limitation of observational studies, advocacy of long‐term maintenance BB therapy and changes in clinical practice cannot be made without large randomized clinical trials. Multiple randomized trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of long‐term BB therapy in patients with MI are ongoing. These upcoming randomized clinical trials will provide solid scientific proof for the effectiveness of long‐term maintenance BB therapy in patients following MI and offer physicians insight into the optimal duration of BB therapy in these patients.

Limitations

This study has several limitations to be considered. First, due to the nature of an observational registry, our findings may also be confounded by reverse causality where BBs would have been stopped in patients who developed clinical events, patients who were intolerant to BBs, those with unacceptable side effects of BBs, or those for whom the financial burden is intolerable. However, to minimize these biases, we excluded patients who were not prescribed BB therapy at discharge and experienced clinical events or death within 3 months after the index MI. Furthermore, we used PS MMWS analyses to rigorously adjust for possible confounders of different baseline characteristics associated with the discontinuation of BBs and performed landmark analysis to prevent immortal time bias. Second, the reason for discontinuation of BBs, the specific dose of each BB, or data about follow‐up patient characteristics or laboratory measures were not provided because the COREA‐AMI registry does not capture this information. Third, because the COREA‐AMI registry was not designed to observe clinical outcomes according to BB duration, our analysis might be underpowered to detect a clinically significant difference in the outcomes, and nonsignificant findings might be significant in a larger cohort of patients.

Cardiovascular morbidity

RCT results on beta-blocker therapy for CV morbidity are conflicting (Table 1). A post hoc analysis of the CHARISMA trial found a 38% reduction in recurrent MI (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.39–1.00), but no effect on stroke (HR: 2.13; 95% CI: 0.92–4.92) or new hospitalizations (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.84–2.34). Similarly, the results from the recently published REDUCE-AMI trial showed no association between beta-blocker therapy and recurrent MI (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.74–1.24) or new CV hospitalizations for heart failure (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.50–1.66). On the contrary, the ABYSS trial reported that patients who interrupted beta-blocker therapy had a numerical increase in the risk of recurrent angina and other CV conditions that led to hospitalizations and coronary procedures. However, no hypothesis testing was performed for these secondary outcomes in this trial which means that the observed differences between groups cannot be concluded as statistically significant. Additionally, because the ABYSS trial aimed to demonstrate noninferiority rather than superiority, the conclusions are focused on whether the interruption of beta-blocker therapy met noninferiority criteria, not whether it led to worse clinical outcomes. This distinction in trial design is key to understanding why these results cannot be easily compared to other RCTs that may have tested superiority.

1.4.2 Revascularization approach

While historical studies implied that surgical revascularization could improve survival rates for patients with CCD, recent studies and comprehensive reviews have largely found no substantial impact of such procedures on reducing all‐cause mortality in CCD patients. A meta‐analysis of randomized trials showed an annualized mortality rate in the medical therapy arm, ACME‐2 (Angioplasty Compared to Medicine: Two‐Vessel Disease) has reported 4.0%, while 1.0% in medical therapy arm of later studies like FAME‐2 (Fractional Flow Reserve Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Plus Optimal Medical Treatment [OMT] vs. OMT), signifying progress in medical management.

The 2023 CCD Guideline, similar to the previous 2021 Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization, emphasizes the importance of informed decisions regarding revascularization. There should be a comprehensive, team‐based approach, the guidelines advocate for the involvement of a Heart Team, including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and other cardiovascular specialists to improve patient outcomes. This team plays a fundamental role in devising revascularization strategies that are tailored to individual patient profiles, especially those with complex coronary or multivessel diseases and other significant comorbidities.

The principle of patient‐centered care is also emphasized. Treatment decisions should reflect the best clinical evidence and align with patients' values, preferences, and goals, reinforcing the practice of shared decision‐making. The 2023 CCD Guideline recommends that for patients with persistent angina that limits their lifestyle despite optimal medical therapy with a disease burden that is amenable to revascularization, revascularization should be an attempt to alleviate symptoms.

1.5 Beta blockers

Prior guidelines have advocated for extended duration of beta‐blocker therapy, especially post‐MI or ACS and continued for 3 years and in CCD. However, a major shift in the guidelines now recommends re‐evaluating the indication for beta‐blockers 1 year after a myocardial event, given the mixed evidence on their long‐term efficacy, possibility of side effects like fatigue and depression, along with possible drug interactions (COR2b). Ongoing beta‐blocker therapy is now specifically indicated only for patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 50%), presenting with angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, or who have experienced spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Beta‐blockers are generally not recommended for CCD patients receiving elective PCI, those without prior MI, or those with LVEF above 50%.

### Effect of beta blockers, particularly carvedilol, on reducing the risk of events after acute myocardial infarction [^116QzKr2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The morbidity and mortality rates of patients who have had acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) are high. Clinical guidelines recommend that most survivors of AMIs without contraindications should receive long-term treatment with beta blockade. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and reinfarction after AMI, but the pharmacologic differences among beta blockers may affect their ability to reduce these adverse events. The beta blocker carvedilol has adjunctive pharmacologic properties, including alpha1-blocking, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiarrhythmic activities that appear to underlie the outcomes demonstrated in experimental models and clinical trials. In conclusion, this review explores the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the preferential use of carvedilol in post-AMI patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

Observational Studies Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

Evidence from the Convergent Registry of Catholic and Chonnam University for Acute MI (COREA-AMI) showed a 36.7% reduction in 3-year all-cause mortality risk for post-MI patients who underwent PCI, had preserved systolic function (LVEF ≥ 50%), and were treated with beta-blocker therapy (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46–0.86). In contrast, analysis of the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institutes of Health (KAMIR-NIH) registry reported that the use of beta-blocker therapy at 1-year follow-up after an electrocardiogram (ECG) following an acute MI reduced the 2-year all-cause mortality risk by 51% in patients with a 1-year LVEF < 50% (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26–0.89)but not in patients with LVEF ≥ 50% (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.74–2.46). Similarly, evidence from the Melbourne Interventional Group registry (MIG) involving 17,562 patients with a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years, demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy after PCI significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 37% in patients with LVEF < 35% (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44–0.91) and by 20% in those with LVEF between 35% and 50% (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68–0.95) but had no effect in those with LVEF > 50% (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.87–1.21).

### Beta-blockers for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction in people with dementia: a systematic review [^114yE1KS]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in industrialized countries. The use of beta-blockers is well established as a secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the benefits of beta-blockers for people living with dementia.

Objective:

To evaluate the use of beta-blockers in people with dementia who have had a myocardial infarction, in order to identify associations between medication use, mortality, re-infarction and functional decline.

Methods:

We searched for all studies (randomized trials, observational cohorts) reporting beta-blocker use in populations with both dementia and previous myocardial infarction. Relevant keywords were used in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science up to October 2018. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers. Quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. PRISMA recommendations were followed throughout.

Results:

Two observational studies were included, representing 10,992 individuals in a community setting and 129,092 individuals from a hospital record-linkage study. One showed use of beta-blockers reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.64–0.86) alongside evidence for an increased rate of functional decline in individuals aged ≥ 65 with moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.11–1.61)). The second study did not find an association between beta-blocker use and mortality in the population living with dementia.

Conclusion:

There is insufficient evidence to support use of beta-blockers to persons living with dementia. A single study provides limited evidence that beta-blockers improve survival rates but with associated detrimental effects on functional status in nursing home residents with cognitive impairment. Decisions to continue beta-blockers in persons living with dementia should be made on an individual basis.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^112NhXep]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In the registry, the duration of continuous BBL use was determined by assessing the number of days for BBL prescription from visit to visit; however, the reason for drug discontinuation was not collected. Any difference in outcomes driven by a patient reason for discontinuation (adverse effects, intolerance, or cost) versus physician‐directed treatment differences based on a perceived risk and benefit cannot be determined from this study. Some variables of interest were not collected, including completeness of revascularization. Several randomized studies support complete revascularization in patients with STEMI, whereas in those with non–ST‐segment–elevation MI, the benefit is less clear. In this study, 56% of patients enrolled had STEMI as index MI, and there was no interaction between MI type (STEMI versus non–ST‐segment–elevation MI; interaction P = 0.12) and the association between BBL maintenance for ≥ 36 months and the risk of the primary outcome (odds ratio, 2.5 for < 12 months compared with ≥ 36 months). Information on the presence and severity of angina was not available, but admission for unstable angina was determined by experienced clinicians according to the Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials Initiative definition. No association between BBL duration and rates of unstable angina was observed, and this may reflect the various pathophysiological mechanisms for angina, including vasospasm, which does not respond to BBLs. The primary results of the study did not change when unstable angina was removed from the primary end point. Although stent type varied, with higher rates of second generation in those with longer duration of BBL therapy, the rate of bare metal stent use overall was low at 3.4%, and stent generation was included as a covariate in the adjusted model.

### Persistent beta-blocker therapy reduces long-term mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke with elevated heart rates [^115AZpN8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Although our study suggests a potential delayed survival benefit for persistent beta‐blocker users compared with never‐users, our power to detect these differences was limited by the decreasing number of persistent users over time. The adjusted HRs for persistent users versus never‐users were statistically insignificant before 30 months but began showing potential benefits thereafter. Recently, questions have emerged regarding the long‐term mortality benefit of beta‐blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction. These findings combined with our results, highlight the need for future research to explore the initiation of beta blockers in high‐risk patients with AIS to evaluate long‐term mortality benefits.

In subgroup analyses, we observed no heterogeneity in the effects of beta blockers across different cardiac indications or beta‐blocker classes. However, we identified some heterogeneity favoring younger patients and those with coronary heart disease or AF. A meta‐analysis of 21 clinical trials reported differential benefits of beta blockers in reducing cardiovascular risk by age, notably favoring patients < 60 years. This could be attributed to decreased beta‐adrenergic responsiveness in the older people. Future research should clarify the differential impacts, particularly concerning age‐specific responses to beta‐blocker therapy.

There was a significantly higher hazard of recurrent AMI in the early BB discontinuation group in the overall cohort (adjusted HR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.8; P = 0.007). This association was stronger in the STEMI subgroup (adjusted HR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.3) than in the NSTEMI subgroup (adjusted HR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.8–1.7), though the interaction test was not significant (P = 0.26) (Table 2). There was also a significantly higher hazard of repeat revascularization in the entire cohort (adjusted HR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7; P = 0.01) driven by the STEMI subgroup (adjusted HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1–2.0; P = 0.01). There was no statistically significant association between early BB discontinuation and all-cause mortality, and no significant interaction between treatment group and STEMI or NSTEMI presentation.

However, some studies found no association between beta-blocker therapy and reduced all-cause mortality risk in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF, including the MINAP (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project) (average treatment effect coefficient: 0.07; 95% CI: -0.60–0.75), the CLARIFY (Prospective Observational Longitudinal Registry of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease) registry (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.84–1.06), the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.78–1.01), and the Danish National Patient Register (absolute risk differences −0.4%; 95% CI: −1.0% to 0.2%). Additionally, Korhonen et al's study using the U.S. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CMS-CCW) found that patients adhering only to beta-blocker therapy had a 32% higher mortality risk than those adhering to all recommended secondary prevention medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and statins) (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.21–1.44), with a more pronounced effect in diabetic patients (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.28–1.62), particularly in men and younger individuals.

Meta-analyses pooling data from RCTs and observational studies have reported a positive relationship between the use of beta-blocker therapy and risk reduction in all-cause mortality in post-MI patients who underwent revascularization, and had, mostly, preserved LVEF (Table 2). Yet, a recent meta-analysis of observational cohort studies that included 217,532 patients reported that the use of beta-blocker therapy for 1 year or more did not significantly reduce the risk of premature mortality of MI patients without heart failure compared to those who did not receive beta-blocker therapy (OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.56–1.14).

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^111LUJVi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of β-blocker therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the late effect of β-blockers in patients with AMI.

Methods and Results

We enrolled all consecutive patients who presented with AMI at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, between June 3, 2003 and February 24, 2015. The primary end point was 5-year all-cause mortality, depending on the use of β-blockers at discharge, 1 year after AMI, and 3 years after AMI. Of 2592 patients, the prescription rates of β-blockers were 72%, 69%, 63%, and 60% at discharge and 1, 3, and 5 years after AMI, respectively. The patients who were receiving β-blocker therapy had more favorable clinical characteristics, such as younger age (62 versus 65 years; P < 0.001). They received reperfusion therapy more often (92% versus 80%; P < 0.001) than those without β-blocker prescription. In the univariate analysis, the patients with β-blocker prescription had lower 5-year mortality at all time points. In the Cox model after adjustment for significant covariates, β-blocker prescription at discharge was associated with a 29% reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.90; P = 0.006); however, β-blocker prescriptions at 1 and 3 years after AMI were not associated with reduced mortality.

Conclusions

The beneficial effect of β-blocker therapy after AMI may be limited until 1 year after AMI. Whether late β-blocker therapy beyond 1 year after AMI offers clinical benefits should be confirmed in further clinical trials.

Observational studies also show mixed results (Table 3). Evidence from the KAMIR-NIH registry showed that beta-blocker therapy was associated with a significant risk reduction for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with LVEF < 50%, particularly in those with LVEF < 40% (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72–0.97). However, no association was observed for patients with LVEF ≥ 50% (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.91–1.48). Results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service registry reported that patients receiving beta-blocker therapy for at least 1 year had an 18% lower risk of combined all-cause death, recurrent MI, or hospitalization for new heart failure (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.75–0.89)but had no significant difference in the risk of recurrent MI alone (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67–1.01) or hospitalization for new heart failure alone (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.73–1.17). Won et al, using the same registry data, found that regular use of beta-blocker therapy was associated with a 29.5% reduced risk of MI (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.06–0.84)but it did not affect the risk of stroke (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.85–1.30). Additionally, the French Healthcare Database indicated that discontinuing beta-blocker therapy after 1 year was associated with a 17% increased risk of CVD-related hospital admissions (among post-MI patients under 80 years of age who underwent revascularization (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01–1.35).

### Clinical outcomes with β-blockers for myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116rtquQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Debate exists about the efficacy of β-blockers in myocardial infarction and their required duration of usage in contemporary practice.

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL search for randomized trials evaluating β-blockers in myocardial infarction enrolling at least 100 patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was performed stratifying trials into reperfusion-era (> 50% undergoing reperfusion or receiving aspirin/statin) or pre-reperfusion-era trials.

Results

Sixty trials with 102,003 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the acute myocardial infarction trials, a significant interaction (Pinteraction = .02) was noted such that β-blockers reduced mortality in the pre-reperfusion (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.94) but not in the reperfusion era (IRR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.05). In the pre-reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced cardiovascular mortality (IRR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), myocardial infarction (IRR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97), and angina (IRR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.95), with no difference for other outcomes. In the reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced myocardial infarction (IRR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.83) (number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB] = 209) and angina (IRR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98) (NNTB = 26) at the expense of increase in heart failure (IRR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16) (number needed to treat to harm [NNTH] = 79), cardiogenic shock (IRR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18–1.41) (NNTH = 90), and drug discontinuation (IRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.55–1.73), with no benefit for other outcomes. Benefits for recurrent myocardial infarction and angina in the reperfusion era appeared to be short term (30 days).

Conclusions

In contemporary practice of treatment of myocardial infarction, β-blockers have no mortality benefit but reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and angina (short-term) at the expense of increase in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation. The guideline authors should reconsider the strength of recommendations for β-blockers post myocardial infarction.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^115TzQni]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy in the pre-reperfusion era

All-cause mortality

Several RCTs from the 1980s consistently demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality in post-MI patients, with reductions ranging from 26% to 42.5% (Table 1). For example, the NMSG (Norwegian Multicentre Study Group), which involved 1,884 patients, reported a 42.5% reduction in all-cause mortality at 33 months in the beta-blocker group compared to the placebo (P = 0.03). Similarly, an RCT comparing intravenous metoprolol to placebo in acute MI patients showed a 36% reduction in all-cause mortality in the beta-blocker group (P < 0.03).

Table 1
Randomized Controlled Trials Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

BHAT (β-Blocker Heart Attack Trial), reported a 7.2% mortality rate in the propranolol group, compared to 9.8% in the placebo group, reflecting a significant reduction in mortality (P < 0.005). Additionally, the CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction) trial, which included nearly 2,000 patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, showed a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60–0.98). Lastly, Freemantle et al's meta-analysis of 31 RCTs and over 24,000 participants, reported a 23% reduction in long-term mortality risk (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.69–0.85) and concluded that beta-blocker therapy reduced 1.2 events of all-cause mortality. Moreover, the authors reported that the number needed to treat with beta-blocker therapy to prevent one death was substantially lower than with antiplatelet therapy (42 vs 292), suggesting that beta-blocker therapy was more effective.

### Improving the management of patients after myocardial infarction, from admission to discharge [^117Bnqim]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent developments in pharmacologic and device therapy, as well as initiatives to increase the use of standard orders and promote in-hospital communication, have improved the care of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). The increased presence of hospitalists, physicians who provide in-hospital care as a specialty, promises to provide further improvements.

Objective

This article reviews current information on evidence-based care of the hospitalized MI patient, with a particular emphasis on identifying left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and appropriate treatments.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for all large-scale clinical trials providing information on the care of post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or heart failure (HF), with no limit on time period. The search terms were post-myocardial infarction, large-scale, randomized, clinical trial, left ventricular dysfunction, and/or heart failure. All trials investigating therapies currently recommended in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ST-elevation MI (ACC/AHA STEMI) guidelines and including post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or HF, as indicated by signs and symptoms of HF or Killip class, were included.

Results

In the acute setting, the ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated), and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (if the patient is undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention). The guidelines recommend use of aldosterone antagonists and statins at discharge, in addition to continuation of all acute therapies. The ACC/AHA guidelines apply to all patients after MI and do not specify whether the recommended therapies are effective in post-MI patients with LVD or HE Reviewing the trials that included post-MI patients with LVD and/or HF, it appears that in some cases, only certain agents within a class have been evaluated (eg, post-MI beta-blocker trials often excluded patients with LVD, and the efficacy of atenolol has not been evaluated in post-MI patients with LVD or HF), and some agents have not shown as much efficacy as others in this high-risk patient population (eg, metoprolol appeared to be associated with poorer outcomes in this population than carvedilol). Rather than recommending an entire class, hospital care maps and critical-care pathway tools should incorporate the use of evidence-based agents.

Conclusions

The use of evidence-based care in the hospital has the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients with LVD and/or HE The hospitalist can facilitate the best practices and best care of the post-MI patient through the use of in-hospital critical-care pathway tools.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^115SbVUq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This landmark analysis of the OBTAIN study was designed to evaluate whether there is benefit to beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI. When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after an MI was not associated with improved survival. However, on the basis of the primary OBTAIN studyresults, we hypothesized there would be a dose‐dependent effect of beta‐blocker dosing in 1‐year survivors after an acute MI. Both multivariate and propensity score analyses of survival by dose suggested that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker therapy and other beta‐blocker doses. The present study provides important data on the role of beta‐blocker dose and therapy in 1‐year survivors after MI.

CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post‐Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction)is the only reperfusion‐era randomized clinical trial to demonstrate a survival benefit of beta‐blocker therapy; in this trial of carvedilol versus placebo in patients after MI with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the survival curves continued to diverge for 2.5 years, suggesting long‐term benefit for this low ejection fraction group. Our findings in the subgroup of patients with a history of congestive heart failure support the continued benefit of beta‐blocker therapy in patients after MI with left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure. Two recent landmark analyses at 1 year after MI have been reported. In these observational studies of 1383and 1946patients, there was no benefit to beta‐blocker therapy when analyzed as a dichotomous variable. In a report from the French national health insurance database including 73 450 patients after MI who had been treated with beta‐blockers for at least 1 year, there was no significant increase in mortality associated with beta‐blocker discontinuation (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94–1.36). The dichotomous analysis in this OBTAIN report is consistent with these findings. However, beta‐blocker dose may be an important modulator of beta‐blocker benefit. It is notable that the same dose (25% of the target dose used in randomized clinical trials) was found to be the optimal dose in this report as in the original OBTAIN report. Furthermore, in this subsample of the OBTAIN study, ≈40% of patients had a change in dose from the discharge dose used in the analysis of the original OBTAIN cohort. The only inconsistent finding in the current analysis is the lack of benefit of the > 12.5% to 25% dose relative to the > 50% dose. This may relate to this latter group being the smallest of the beta‐blocker treatment groups. In a report from the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines) registry, a landmark analysis was performed at 3 years after MI in patients aged ≥ 65 years old (mean age, 75 years), stratified by no beta‐blocker, < 50% of target dose, and ≥ 50% of target dose. No difference in outcomes was noted. However, there was no delineation between the 12.5% and 25% dose. Furthermore, the authors note that the findings were consistent in patients with and without heart failure or systolic dysfunction, questioning the generalizability of these findings. Therefore, the present report provides further support that the medical discussion around the use of beta‐blockers after MI, even long‐term use, must center on dose and not simply use. This is a major paradigm change, because the vast majority of studies in this field do not address dose. It is important to note that there has not been a single randomized clinical trial of beta‐blockers after acute MI that tested multiple doses.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^115jAucB]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these favorable results, other studies have reported no association between beta-blocker therapy and reduced risk of the recurrence of MI and stroke in post-MI patients with LVEF ≥ 50%, who underwent revascularization, and were optimally treated with other secondary cardiovascular prevention medications.

Results from meta-analyses vary (Table 2). Maqsood et al reported no association between beta-blocker therapy and risk reduction of MACE (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70–1.08), while Safi et al reported no effect on MACE and stroke (RR: 0.81; 97.5% CI: 0.43–1.52). However, in their 2021 meta-analysis, Safi et al reported that beta-blocker therapy reduced the risk of MACE by 28% (RR: 0.72; 97.5% CI: 0.62–0.83) and the recurrence of MI by 24% (RR: 0.76; 98% CI: 0.67–0.86) in patients with LVEF > 40%. Liang et al reported significant risk reduction for MACE in the Caucasian population (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79–0.97) but not in the Asian population (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.69–1.15). In addition, the authors reported no association between beta-blocker therapy and the recurrence of MI (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.78–1.11) and stroke (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.79–1.12). Similarly, Hu et al reported no association between beta-blocker therapy and MACE (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.80–1.21), recurrent MI (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.80–1.50), and stroke (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.37–2.59) in patients with preserved LVEF function.

Why conflicting results?

The variability in the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy results from differences in study design, methodologies, and statistical approaches, leading to inconsistent outcomes and selection biases. Specific reasons are discussed below.

Results

Cohort formation and characteristics

Among the 29,782 potentially eligible patients, 4,768 met all eligibility criteria, including 1,155 (24.2%) in the early BB discontinuation group and 3,613 (75.8%) in the standard BB treatment group (Figure 1). The most frequent reason for exclusion was lack of an available LVEF value. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the 2 study groups, and Supplemental Table 2 compares the characteristics of the included cohort with those excluded based on missing in-hospital LVEF value. Patients in the early BB discontinuation group were younger (mean age 59.8 vs 61.5 years; P < 0.001), but the distributions of AMI subtype, sex, and comorbidities were similar between the 2 groups. Patients in the early BB discontinuation group had less extensive CAD and were less likely to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention in-hospital (61.4% vs 71.2%, P < 0.001), but LVEF was similar in the 2 groups. The early BB discontinuation group was also less likely to be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or statins at hospital discharge (P < 0.001). Patients in the 2 groups had a similar distribution of BB medications and dosing at hospital discharge (Supplemental Table 3). All patients in the standard BB treatment group who were alive at 1 year after discharge had an active BB prescription on dispensing records covering this time point. In both groups, the majority of patients were prescribed metoprolol and classified as a medium strength BB dosing.

### Prescribing of β-blockers after myocardial infarction: a preliminary study of physician motivations and barriers [^113veG2p]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend beta-blocker medications in the management of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients to prevent subsequent MI; evidence suggests that this therapy continues to be underutilized. The decision-making process that physicians use for treating post-MI patients should be explored; behavior-change interventions have been proposed among researchers in this field.

Objective

The aim of this pilot study was to develop measures for examining this issue using the transtheoretical model (TTM) of change, including physician stage of readiness for change and physician salience (ie, decisional balance) for the pros (ie, facilitators) and cons (ie, barriers) of prescribing beta-blockers to post-MI patients.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, a TTM-based questionnaire was developed from the literature and from interviews with a convenience sample of physicians practicing in cardiology; the questionnaire was subjected to expert panels for revision and was pretested. It was then mailed to all physicians practicing family medicine, internal medicine, or cardiology during the autumn of 2003 in northern West Virginia, a state with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and MI-related mortality.

Results

Among the 309 physicians who received the questionnaire, 103 responded; 55 responses were complete and eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Most (92.7%) responded to the TTM measures in the action and maintenance stages of change for prescribing beta-blockers for post-MI patients. Results also suggested they had significant salience (P < 0.05) for the cons of prescribing beta-blocker therapy to patients with relative contraindications that were indicated in the earlier versions of the CPGs, but not in the latest version. Other specific barriers to prescribing were also identified.

Conclusions

Results of this preliminary study suggest that it would be relevant to increase physician knowledge of the updated CPGs regarding use of beta-blockers in the presence of conditions previously deemed relative contraindications.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^11674GmP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

A total of 7159 patients who had been prescribed BBs at discharge and had no clinical events within 3 months after discharge were included in the analysis (Figure 1). The duration of BB maintenance was < 12 months in 1729 patients (16.1%), 12 to < 24 months in 809 (11.3%), 24 to < 36 months in 864 (12.1%), and ≥ 36 months in 3757 (52.5%). The most widely used BB was carvedilol (52.7%), followed by bisoprolol (35.2%) and nebivolol (9.0%) without a difference in a prescription pattern according to BB duration (Table S1) (metoprolol is not available in Korea because it is not manufactured or imported). The baseline clinical and procedural characteristics of the study groups distinguished by the duration of BB maintenance are detailed in Table 1. (Baseline characteristics after PS weighted with MMWS are listed in Table S2.) Compared with patients who maintained BB use ≥ 36 months, patients who took a shorter duration of BB were older; had a lower body mass index; had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, previous stroke, chronic kidney disease, and dialysis; and had lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline LVEF, and hemoglobin levels. Regarding procedural characteristics, patients who took a shorter duration of BB were at higher baseline procedural risk, as supported by the fact that they were more likely to have received bare‐metal stents or first‐generation drug‐eluting stents and long stent length and more likely to present with hemodynamic instability (ie, hypotension, tachycardia, and New York Heart Association class III or IV) upon arrival than patients who received BBs for ≥ 36 months.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^114QrmSe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of survivors of uncomplicated AMI free of heart failure, arrhythmia, or LV dysfunction, 24% of patients had early discontinuation of BBs within 180 days. Continuation of BBs past 180 days was not associated with a reduction in the composite endpoint of death, recurrent AMI, or repeat revascularization in the subsequent 5 years. However, we observed an association between early BB discontinuation and increased risks of both recurrent AMI and repeat coronary revascularization procedures. No association was found between early BB discontinuation and all-cause mortality. Our study helps to address some of the limitations of previous observational studies, by restricting inclusion to new users of BB after AMI who are eligible for this treatment without other evidence-based indications or contraindications, and focusing on the timeframe when decisions about the duration of BB therapy post-MI are most relevant (ie, 6 months after the index AMI). Our finding of similar rates of death regardless of BB continuation or withdrawal is in keeping with the REDUCE-AMI and ABYSS triaIs. However, both of these trials reported no difference in recurrent AMI between treatment groups, contrary to our findings. The differences may be due to a larger number of follow-up AMI events in our study leading to increased power to detect an effect, or to unrecognized confounding, or to chance. The ABYSS trial, which was similar in design to this analysis, did suggest a higher rate of cardiovascular hospitalizations in the BB interruption group, though the rate of repeat revascularization procedures was relatively low and similar between the groups. One important difference between the ABYSS trial and this analysis is that in ABYSS, the mean time between the last AMI and randomization was 2.9 years, suggesting that the trial enrolled a population with chronic stable CAD. In addition, our observations may be related to the lower use of percutaneous coronary intervention during the index hospitalization (61% to 71%) in our study compared with the randomized trials.

### Long-term follow-up after acute myocardial infarction according to beta-blocker dose [^117HaJRD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to examine the association between beta-blocker dose and mortality following acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

This nationwide cohort study enrolled all patients admitted for first-time acute myocardial infarction in Denmark between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2014, using the Danish National Patient Registry. Patients alive 15 days after admission were followed until death, emigration, or December 31, 2014. Patients were categorized according to daily beta-blocker consumption (0%, > 0%-12.5%, > 12.5%-25%, > 25%-50%, > 50%-100%, or > 100% of the currently recommended target dose) based on prescriptions registered in the Danish National Database of Reimbursed Prescriptions. Doses were continuously updated during follow-up. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were computed and adjusted for confounders using Cox proportional hazard regression.

Results

Among 65,125 patients followed, any beta-blocker dose was associated with significant mortality reduction compared with no treatment (adjusted MRR ≤ 0.92 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.86–0.98]). The largest reduction was observed within the first year for beta-blocker doses > 25%-50% (adjusted MRR = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.50–0.60]). After 1 year, doses > 50%-100% were associated with the largest mortality reduction (adjusted MRR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.50–0.67]), but it did not differ significantly from that associated with doses > 25%-50% (adjusted MRR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.61–0.77]).

Conclusions

Any beta-blocker dose was associated with significant mortality reduction following acute myocardial infarction compared with no treatment. Doses > 25%-50% of the currently recommended target dose were associated with maximal mortality reduction within the first year after acute myocardial infarction, suggesting that higher doses are unnecessary.

### Beta-blockers for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction in people with dementia: a systematic review [^117BUiJy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in industrialized countries. The use of beta-blockers is well established as a secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the benefits of beta-blockers for people living with dementia.

Objective

To evaluate the use of beta-blockers in people with dementia who have had a myocardial infarction, in order to identify associations between medication use, mortality, re-infarction and functional decline.

Methods

We searched for all studies (randomized trials, observational cohorts) reporting beta-blocker use in populations with both dementia and previous myocardial infarction. Relevant keywords were used in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science up to October 2018. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers. Quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. PRISMA recommendations were followed throughout.

Results

Two observational studies were included, representing 10,992 individuals in a community setting and 129,092 individuals from a hospital record-linkage study. One showed use of beta-blockers reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.64–0.86) alongside evidence for an increased rate of functional decline in individuals aged ≥ 65 with moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.11–1.61)). The second study did not find an association between beta-blocker use and mortality in the population living with dementia.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to support use of beta-blockers to persons living with dementia. A single study provides limited evidence that beta-blockers improve survival rates but with associated detrimental effects on functional status in nursing home residents with cognitive impairment. Decisions to continue beta-blockers in persons living with dementia should be made on an individual basis.

### Beta-blocker underuse in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction [^1166iE8c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical benefits of beta-blockers as secondary prevention following a myocardial infarction (MI) and to address the reasons that clinicians are reluctant to use beta-blockers in specific patient populations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for articles published from January 1966 to October 2002. Relevant studies were identified by systematic searches of the literature for all reported studies of associations between beta-blocker underuse and secondary prevention of MI. Additional studies were identified by a hand search of references of original or review articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language human studies were selected and analyzed.

Data Synthesis

Associations were observed in studies of beta-blocker use as secondary prevention of MI. A lower rate of beta-blocker treatment occurred in older patients and in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and peripheral arterial disease. In addition, underuse was attributed to the perception of high rates of adverse events associated with beta-blockers. beta-Blocker use as secondary prevention of an MI can lead to a 19–48% decrease in mortality and up to a 28% decrease in reinfarction rates. Nonetheless, beta-blockers are significantly underused in many patient populations due to concomitant disease states. Due to their normal physiologic deterioration, the elderly are at an increased risk of low cardiac output and bradycardia when given a beta-blocker; therefore, they should be started on a low dose that is then slowly titrated. In diabetic patients, beta-blockers can impair glucose control leading to hypoglycemia; therefore, post-MI diabetic patients must routinely monitor their blood glucose levels. In patients with decompensated heart failure, beta-blocker use can lead to further cardiac depression, but lower oral starting doses with slow titration can reduce this risk. beta-Blockers can induce bronchospasm in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, but cardioselective beta-blockers and appropriate use of medications such as albuterol can minimize these effects. Finally, in patients with peripheral arterial disease, with the exception of hypertensive patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, beta-blockers can be used safely. The only absolute contraindications to beta-blockers are severe bradycardia, preexisting sick sinus syndrome, second- and third-degree atrioventricular block, severe left ventricular dysfunction, active peripheral vascular disease with rest ischemia, or reactive airway disease so severe that airway support is required.

Conclusions

Overall, the cardiovascular benefits of beta-blockers as secondary prevention of MI significantly outweigh the risks associated with their use.

### Are beta-blockers always beneficial after a myocardial… [^1179N4y1]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

A 2014 meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials performed in the "reperfusion era" reexamined the benefits and harms of adding beta-blockers to modern interventions in patients after MI. Beta-blockers did not improve mortality, and their benefits were limited to the first 30 days. An AFP POEM synopsis reported that while beta-blockers reduced the risk of recurrent MI and angina symptoms, they also increased rates of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. On the other hand, a 2020 Cochrane for Clinicians on beta-blockers after suspected or diagnosed acute MI, while noting that "most trials were conducted before the introduction of what is now considered standard reperfusion therapy, " found reduced risks of MI, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality even in patients who had not received PCI, thrombolytics, or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Consequently, the authors recommended, "family physicians should continue to incorporate beta-blocker therapy in the care of patients with a history of MI. " The current American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association guideline for management of patients with chronic coronary disease splits the difference. As stated in a POEM in the March 2024 issue, "Long-term beta blockers are no longer routinely recommended and should be limited to patients with heart failure, myocardial infarction in the past year, or another indication". To clarify the effects of beta-blocker therapy post-MI, a randomized, open-label trial published earlier this month assigned more than 5, 000 patients with an acute MI and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 50% to long-term therapy with metoprolol or bisoprolol or no treatment. After a median of 3. 5 years, there was no difference between the groups in the primary composite outcome of death from any cause or new MI.

Other potential benefits and harms, including hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or heart failure and hospitalization for bradycardia, hypotension, or syncope, were also statistically similar between the groups. Although these findings suggest that beta-blockers have no effects in post-MI patients without heart failure, an accompanying editorial observed that several more trials addressing this important clinical question will be completed in the next few years.

### Continued beta blocker use after acute MI reduces hospitalizations but not cardiovascular death, acute MI, or stroke… [^112JGQwk]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Should beta blockers be continued long term or discontinued after acute myocardial infarction. BOTTOM LINE The single-blinded study showed that continued use of beta blockers after acute MI reduced hospitalizations, but there was no change in cardiovascular death, acute MI, or stroke. There were no differences reported in quality of life between groups. SYNOPSIS Beta blockers are often used for life following an acute MI, but is that still appropriate in the modern era of percutaneous coronary interventions and other advances. The French investigators identified 3, 698 patients at 49 sites with acute MI in the past 6 months who were taking a beta blocker. Those with heart failure or an ejection fraction of less than 40%, a recent cardiovascular event, or another indication for beta blockers were excluded.

Participants were randomized to discontinue the beta blocker or continue taking the same medication at the same dose. At baseline, the average age was 62 years, 67% had an ST-elevation MI, 95% had a history of revascularization, and the median time from acute MI to randomization was 2. 9 years. The groups were balanced, and the analysis was by intention to treat. This was a noninferiority study with a prespecified margin of 3%. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events and was judged as not noninferior for interruption compared with continued therapy. Regarding individual outcomes, the benefit came from fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations, with no difference in cardiovascular death, acute MI, or stroke. There was also no difference in quality of life between groups.

### Why arent't we using beta blockers after acute MI? [^1123FHNC]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In this issue of American Family Physician, Howard and Ellerbeck 1 discuss the underutilization of therapy with beta blockers after acute myocardial infarction. That beta blockers are useful after acute MI is certainly not a new concept in medicine; the evidence that beta blockers significantly reduce mortality after acute MI was produced in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial 2 in the early 1980s. If the evidence has been around for nearly 20 years, why are so many practitioners not using beta-blocker therapy in patients who have had an MI. This is not an easy question to answer. As physicians, we are inundated with new literature, new medications and new technology, and this information overload can be quite overwhelming. However, it has been shown repeatedly that beta blockers decrease mortality after acute MI. How many ways can it be said. How many times do we have to hear the evidence before we change our practice habits.

Therapeutic trials are performed with the idea that favorable outcomes will cause health practitioners to change their practice habits. This is an easy concept: if something helps, we should do it, and if something does not help, we should not do it. The concept does not appear to be that easy in practice, however. If matters were clear-cut, for the past 20 years eligible patients would have received beta blockers after acute MI, and the evidence does not show that this is the case. 3 What will it take to get us to change our ways. Studies have evaluated which interventions are the most helpful in trying to get physicians to put new evidence into practice. Obviously, though, we all learn in different ways. One study. So where does that leave us.

Many physicians receive their new information in just those ways that were shown to be less helpful: educational materials and didactic educational meetings. 5 I see what the studies show; however, I know that for me, repetition is the key to learning, and perhaps others learn this way too. So, for what it is worth, let me stress yet again: beta blockers significantly reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Let's put this evidence into practice.

### Association of β-blockers with functional outcomes after acute myocardial infarction… [^113Eo7pV]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Functional decline, death, and rehospitalization in the first 90 days after AMI. Functional status was measured using the Morris scale of independence in activities of daily living. Results. Mortality benefits of β-blockers were similar across all subgroups. Conclusions and Relevance Use of β-blockers after AMI is associated with functional decline in older nursing home residents with substantial cognitive or functional impairment, but not in those with relatively preserved mental and functional abilities. Use of β-blockers yielded a considerable mortality benefit in all groups. After acute myocardial infarction, β-blockers are a mainstay of guideline-recommended care for adults. 1, 2 Randomized trials in middle-aged and young-old adults show that treatment with β-blockers after AMI reduces mortality by 25% to 30%.

3–5 Multiple observational studies have found a similar level of mortality reduction in adults 85 years or older and in those with functional impairment or multiple chronic conditions. 6–9. Users of β-blockers had a higher rate of functional decline than nonusers. In the first 90 days after AMI, the odds of functional decline were 1. 14 times greater in patients receiving β-blockers than in those not using β-blockers. Users of β-blockers were less likely than nonusers to die within 90 days of hospital discharge. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 death was 26. Use of β-blockers had no effect on time to rehospitalization.

In this national study of older nursing home residents, using β-blockers after AMI resulted in a 26% relative reduction in 90-day mortality, with a number needed to treat of 26 to prevent 1 death. Similar levels of risk reduction were found across a wide variety of patient subgroups. However, β-blockers conferred a 14% relative increase in the odds of functional decline, with a number need to harm of 52 to cause 1 case of functional decline.
