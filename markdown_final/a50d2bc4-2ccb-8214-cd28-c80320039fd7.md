## Question

What is presdex

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "presdex" is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "presdex" is a misspelling or a brand name. Then, I should verify the correct drug identity and its pharmacologic class. Next, I will review FDA-approved indications and key clinical uses. After that, I need to check dosing, preparation, and safety warnings. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize the bottom line with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the name mapping, because "presdex" does not correspond to a standard drug name. Wait, let me verify the likely intended name: multiple authoritative sources consistently refer to dexmedetomidine hydrochloride by the brand name Precedex, so "presdex" almost certainly reflects a misspelling or autocorrect error for Precedex, which is dexmedetomidine hydrochloride [^117SFtii] [^1124GTFF] [^115P8XHf].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic identity. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that provides sedation, anxiolysis, and modest analgesia with minimal respiratory depression, distinguishing it from GABAergic sedatives like benzodiazepines and propofol; this mechanism underlies its use in ICU sedation and procedural settings where airway preservation is important [^117SFtii] [^112h5szx].

> Next, I should review the FDA-approved indications. Hold on, I should verify the exact labeling: dexmedetomidine is indicated for two adult uses — sedation of initially intubated, mechanically ventilated ICU patients for up to 24 hours, and procedural sedation of non-intubated adults prior to and during surgical or diagnostic procedures; I initially thought there was a third labeled indication for pediatric ICU sedation, but wait, I need to correct that — pediatric ICU sedation is not an FDA-approved indication on these labels, even though pediatric procedural sedation has been studied and may be approved under different labeling, so I should not overstate pediatric ICU use here [^117SFtii] [^115wLo4R] [^115feWDP].

> Let me consider clinical applications and efficacy signals. Dexmedetomidine is commonly used as an alternative or adjunct to propofol or benzodiazepines in the ICU, with meta-analytic and large RCT data suggesting potential reductions in delirium and modest effects on ventilator duration, though mortality effects are neutral overall and safety signals like bradycardia and hypotension require vigilance; I should double-check that the largest contemporary RCT, SPICE III, showed no mortality difference but more bradycardia and hypotension, which aligns with the safety profile [^1153MYcX] [^114iUTAM].

> I need to check dosing and preparation details. Typical ICU dosing includes a loading dose of about 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hour, with many clinicians using 0.5 mcg/kg/hour as a starting point and titrating to effect; for procedural sedation, total doses around 1.6 mcg/kg with mean infusion rates near 1.3 mcg/kg/hour have been studied, and the drug must be diluted to 4 mcg/mL for infusion unless using a premixed solution; I should confirm that the 200 mcg/2 mL vial requires dilution to 4 mcg/mL, which it does [^111fA639] [^112Esisz] [^112DtboB] [^115P8XHf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without reviewing key warnings. I should confirm the major adverse effects: hypotension, bradycardia, and even sinus arrest can occur, particularly with rapid IV push or in patients with high vagal tone; transient hypertension during the loading dose is also described; drug-induced hyperthermia or pyrexia resistant to conventional cooling has been reported and warrants discontinuation if suspected; withdrawal phenomena including nausea, vomiting, and agitation have been observed after prolonged infusions, so tapering is prudent when used beyond 24 hours; I need to ensure I note that co-administration with other sedatives, opioids, or negative chronotropes can potentiate effects, necessitating dose adjustments [^112pPGQu] [^1124GTFF] [^112DtboB] [^1124GTFF] [^114ugRap].

> Let me think about special populations and precautions. In older adults, the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension is higher, so dose reduction should be considered; in hepatic impairment, protein binding is altered and dose reduction is advised; in pregnancy, data are limited and animal data suggest potential fetal risk, so use only if benefits outweigh risks; in lactation, small amounts appear in breast milk with low relative infant dose, but mothers should monitor infants for irritability; for pediatrics, ICU sedation is not established on these labels, and neonates and infants under 1 month are not studied, so safety and efficacy remain unestablished for those uses here [^115feWDP] [^113w1kA3] [^116jzCsz] [^111SgLLU] [^115aDbKE].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant something other than Precedex? I should double-check for look-alike or sound-alike confusion. There is no commonly used drug named "presdex", and the closest branded entity is Precedex, which is consistently dexmedetomidine across FDA labeling and clinical literature; if the intent was different, clarification would be needed, but based on available sources, Precedex/dexmedetomidine is the most plausible and clinically coherent interpretation [^117SFtii] [^115wLo4R].

> Bottom line, after verifying the name and indications, "presdex" appears to be a misspelling of Precedex, which is dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, an alpha-2 agonist used for ICU sedation of mechanically ventilated adults and for procedural sedation in non-intubated adults, with favorable features like minimal respiratory depression but meaningful risks of bradycardia, hypotension, transient hypertension during loading, drug-related hyperthermia, and withdrawal after prolonged use; dosing requires dilution to 4 mcg/mL and careful titration, and special populations may need dose adjustments and enhanced monitoring [^117SFtii] [^115wLo4R] [^112pPGQu] [^112DtboB] [^115feWDP].

Precedex is the brand name for **dexmedetomidine**, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used for sedation in ICU and procedural settings [^117SFtii]. It provides **sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia** with minimal respiratory depression, but can cause bradycardia and hypotension [^112pPGQu]. Precedex is indicated for ICU sedation in mechanically ventilated adults (≤ 24 h) and for procedural sedation in non-intubated adults [^115wLo4R]; it is not a controlled substance and has no established pediatric ICU indication on this label [^115cUFvD] [^115feWDP]. Dosing is titrated to effect, with a typical loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/h maintenance [^111fA639]; patients require continuous monitoring for hemodynamic changes [^112pPGQu].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist causing sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia via inhibition of sympathetic outflow from the locus coeruleus [^112h5szx].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid distribution (Vss ~118 L), 94% protein binding, hepatic metabolism, and renal excretion; terminal half-life ~2 hours [^115aDbKE].
- **Respiratory effects**: Minimal respiratory depression, preserving spontaneous ventilation [^112h5szx].

---

## Clinical indications

Precedex is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| ICU sedation | Sedation of initially intubated, mechanically ventilated adults (≤ 24 h) [^117SFtii] [^115wLo4R] |
| Procedural sedation | Sedation of non-intubated adults prior to/during surgical or diagnostic procedures [^117SFtii] [^115wLo4R] |

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Loading dose**: 1 mcg/kg IV over 10 minutes.
- **Maintenance infusion**: 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/h, titrated to desired sedation level [^115aDbKE].
- **Preparation**: Dilute to 4 mcg/mL; premixed solutions are available [^112DtboB] [^115P8XHf].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation during infusion [^notfound].

---

## Clinical advantages

- **Minimal respiratory depression**: Preserves spontaneous ventilation, useful in ICU and procedural settings [^112h5szx].
- **Reduced delirium**: Associated with lower delirium rates compared with benzodiazepines in ICU patients [^notfound].
- **Analgesic properties**: Reduces opioid requirements [^117YLnbA].

---

## Adverse effects and precautions

- **Common adverse effects**: Hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, dry mouth, and headache [^112Esisz] [^111fF7b9].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Sinus arrest, asystole, and drug-related hyperthermia [^112pPGQu] [^112DtboB].
- **Precautions**: Use caution in patients with bradycardia, hypotension, or heart block; monitor hemodynamics closely [^1124GTFF].

---

## Contraindications

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to dexmedetomidine** and **severe bradycardia or heart block without a pacemaker** [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Category C; use only if benefits outweigh risks [^notfound].
- **Lactation**: Present in breast milk; monitor infant for irritability [^111SgLLU].
- **Pediatrics**: Safety and efficacy not established for ICU sedation; pediatric procedural sedation is approved but not labeled here due to marketing exclusivity [^115feWDP].

---

## Comparison with other sedatives

Compared with benzodiazepines, Precedex offers **less respiratory depression and delirium** but more bradycardia and hypotension [^112h5szx]. Compared with propofol, it provides less respiratory depression and a more natural sleep-like sedation, though it may be less effective for deep sedation and can cause bradycardia [^112h5szx] [^114iUTAM].

---

Precedex (dexmedetomidine) is a **selective alpha-2 agonist** providing sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression, primarily used in ICU and procedural settings. It requires careful hemodynamic monitoring due to risks of bradycardia and hypotension [^112pPGQu].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids

Co-administration of Precedex with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between Precedex and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with Precedex, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.

7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers

In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of Precedex for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.

Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids: Enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in dosage of Precedex or the concomitant medication may be required. (7.1)

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Drug Administration

Precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of Precedex, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving Precedex.

5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest

Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with Precedex administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Precedex, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Precedex-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex) [^117YLnbA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than patients randomized to Precedex (see TABLE 11).

A significantly greater percentage of patients in the Precedex group compared to the placebo group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any propofol rescue (see TABLE 11).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.43 versus 0.89 mg/h). In addition, 41% (83 of 203 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15% (30 of 198 patients) in the placebo group.

In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration. Precedex was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint, the percent of time patients were adequately sedated (81% versus 81%). In addition, administration of Precedex for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and a dose-related increase in adverse events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

14.2 Procedural Sedation

The safety and efficacy of Precedex for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of Precedex in patients having a variety of elective surgeries/procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care. Study 2 evaluated Precedex in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure.

Adverse reaction information was also derived from the placebo-controlled, continuous infusion trials of Precedex for sedation in the surgical intensive care unit setting in which 387 adult patients received Precedex for less than 24 hours. The most frequently observed treatment-emergent adverse events included hypotension, hypertension, nausea, bradycardia, fever, vomiting, hypoxia, tachycardia and anemia (see TABLE 3).

In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration in adult patients. Key treatment emergent adverse events occurring in dexmedetomidine or midazolam treated patients in the randomized active comparator continuous infusion long-term intensive care unit sedation study are provided in TABLE 4. The number (%) of subjects who had a dose-related increase in treatment-emergent adverse events by maintenance adjusted dose rate range in the Precedex group is provided in TABLE 5.

The following adverse events occurred between 2 and 5% for Precedex and Midazolam, respectively: renal failure acute (2.5%, 0.8%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (2.5%, 0.8%), and respiratory failure (4.5%, 3.3%).

Procedural Sedation

Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)] in which 318 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥ 65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Precedex (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance.

9.3 Dependence

The dependence potential of Precedex has not been studied in humans. However, since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that Precedex exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine, it is possible that Precedex may produce a clonidine-like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex) [^1124GTFF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Caution should be exercised when administering Precedex to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because Precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.

In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with Precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with Precedex.

5.3 Transient Hypertension

Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of Precedex. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.

5.4 Arousability

Some patients receiving Precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.

5.5 Withdrawal

Intensive Care Unit Sedation

With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation.

### Postoperative recovery of colorectal patients enhanced with dexmedetomidine (PReCEDex): a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HAggn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine has shown promise in improving postoperative gastrointestinal function. In the context of colorectal surgery, the results remain inconsistent. This review aims to provide a synthesis of studies assessing the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative gastrointestinal function in colorectal surgery patients.

Methods

CENTRAL, Emcare, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched up to September 2023. Randomized controlled trials involving adult patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing elective colorectal surgery, comparing dexmedetomidine administration to a control group, and reporting on postoperative gastrointestinal function were included. Non-comparative and emergent procedures were excluded. Primary outcome was time to first flatus or bowel movement, and secondary outcomes included length of stay and time to solid oral intake. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized studies.

Results

After screening 1194 citations, eight studies were included. Studies comprised of 570 patients in the dexmedetomidine group (mean age: 65.8 years, 43% female, mean BMI: 22.7 kg/m²) and 556 patients in control group (mean age 70.6 years, 40% female, mean BMI 22.5 kg/m²). Dexmedetomidine administration resulted in a shorter time to flatus (MD -4.55 h, 95% CI: 20.14–8.95, p < 0.005, very low certainty of evidence), a shorter time to first bowel movement (MD -11.9 h, 95% CI: 18.74–5.05, p < 0.005, very low certainty of evidence), a shorter time to solid oral intake (MD -4.34 h, 95% CI: 17.43–11.24, p < 0.005, moderate certainty of evidence), and a shorter length of stay (MD -.06 days, 95% CI: 1.99–0.12, p < 0.05, very low certainty of evidence).

Conclusion

In adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine results in clinically meaningful improvements in postoperative gastrointestinal function and consequently, shorter length of stay. Therefore, dexmedetomidine may serve as a valuable adjunct in enhancing postoperative recovery of patients following elective colorectal surgery, thereby reducing healthcare utilization, and improving patient outcomes.

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex) [^111fA639]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of PRECEDEX by comparing the percentage of adult patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication. A significantly greater percentage of adult patients in the PRECEDEX group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group (see TABLE 13).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.47 versus 0.83 mg/h). In addition, 44% (79 of 178 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19% (33 of 175 patients) in the placebo group.

In a second study, 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive Precedex by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3. Patients were allowed to receive "rescue" propofol as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered as needed for pain. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (propofol) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated.

### The role of precedex in post-operative pain management following craniosynostosis repair [^116eRb8X]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The application of dexmedetomidine (precedex) in pediatric settings has increased due to its superior safety and efficacy profile and it has been specifically suggested as an adjunct to IV acetaminophen and a substitute for morphine in craniosynostosis repair. However, reports of its use in pediatrics, let alone in craniosynostosis repair, remain limited and to date there are no studies addressing its use after craniosynostosis repair in children. This study is an IRB-approved retrospective case review of the use of dexmedetomidine following pediatric craniosynostosis repair as a postoperative analgesic/sedative agent at one institution.

### Use of dexmedetomidine in critical-ill patients: is it time to look to the actual evidence? [^114iUTAM]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

To the editor

Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 (ɑ2) adrenergic receptor and imidazoline type 2 receptor agonist that received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1999 as a sedative and analgesic that also reduces stress, anxiety, and the risk of delirium in critically ill patients. Commercialized under the name Precedex by Pfizer, it has been used widely across the globe, and it´s still considered to be part of a gold-standard care agent alongside propofol for critically ill patients, patients in the operating room and patients under mechanical ventilation. However, robust evidence published in the last years show serious concerns about its safety and efficacy as a sedative agent, leading to the debate about its recommended usage.

The SPICE III was a randomized controlled trial that included 4000 patients and evaluated the mortality at the ICU when administering dexmedetomidine at a maximum dose of 1.5 mcg/kg/h adjusted to reach a targeted Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) score of − 2 to + 1, compared to usual care involving propofol and benzodiazepines. The study reported no significant difference in 90-day mortality (95% CI − 2.9 to 2.8, p = 0.98). However, trying to reach the targeted RASS score, the dexmedetomidine group needed more sedative agents when compared with the control group, reflecting a potential and considerable efficacy issue of the agent. Added to this, the dexmedetomidine group experienced a significantly higher incidence of adverse effects including bradycardia (5.1% vs. 0.5%, p = < 0.0001), hypotension (2.7% vs. 0.5%, p = < 0.0001), and persistent asystole (0.7% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.003), indicating a potential major flaw of the indiscriminate use of dexmedetomidine. A subgroup analysis revealed varied treatment responses based on age, with a significant higher mortality observed in patients younger than 63.7 years. Although exploratory results from subgroup analysis should be taken cautiously, this might represent the opening of an unprecedented and unexpected pandora box in one of the most common sedative strategies worldwide.

### Editorial commentary: addition of dexmedetomidine to local analgesia for knee arthroscopy [^116NdU5U]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The search for the ideal pain management strategy after knee arthroscopy continues. For patients unable to receive regional anesthesia, peri-articular or intra-articular injections of local anesthetics with other medications offer a promising solution. Dexmedetomidine (a short-term sedative analgesic marketed under the names Dexdor and Precedex), when added to local anesthetics, may offer an increase in the length of time between surgery and the need for a rescue analgesic agent. Whether the addition of dexmedetomidine results in lower pain scores or decreased opioid consumption remains to be proven. Systemic effects of dexmedetomidine, such as sedation and hypotension, appear less likely to occur with intra-articular injections, suggesting a favorable safety profile. The effects of dexmedetomidine on chondrocytes, as well as the effects of combining medications in the intra-articular environment, are less well understood and should be a focus of further research. Similarly, there is still a need to identify the best patients, best procedures, best combination of medications, and best doses to optimize our approach to post-operative pain management via intra-articular injection.

### General anesthesia in a patient with citrullinemia using precedex as an adjunct to prevent delayed emergence [^114PKThJ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Citrullinemia type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that causes reduced activity of the enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase, which is needed for proper urea metabolism. The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the α-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 μmol/L (reference, 9–33 μmol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 μmol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence.

### Cost-effectiveness of α ₂ agonists for intravenous sedation in patients with critical illness [^1153MYcX]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with critical illness receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) require sedation. Propofol is the most widely used first-line sedative medication for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), but the α 2 agonist dexmedetomidine is also widely used. Clonidine is an α 2 agonist with lower α 2 -receptor selectivity, but it is used for sedation in the ICU, mostly in the UK. Despite previous research, there is uncertainty whether dexmedetomidine-based sedation is clinically superior to propofol-based sedation, and safety concerns remain about the use of dexmedetomidine. To our knowledge, the safety and effectiveness of clonidine-based sedation have not been studied in large randomized clinical trials. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of dexmedetomidine suggest that it may be associated with reduced delirium, duration of MV, and ICU length of stay, with no overall associations with mortality. The largest randomized clinical trial found no effect on mortality but suggested possible heterogeneity of treatment effects by age, with younger patients experiencing increased mortality and older patients experiencing decreased mortality compared with usual care with propofol, benzodiazepines, or both.

The Alpha 2 Agonists for Sedation to Produce Better Outcomes From Critical Illness (A2B) trial was a 3-armed randomized clinical trial comparing dexmedetomidine-, clonidine-, and propofol-based primary sedation for patients with critical illness receiving MV. The study found that neither dexmedetomidine- nor clonidine-based IV sedation was superior to propofol-based IV sedation in reducing time to successful extubation.

To our knowledge, there have been 3 economic analyses conducted of dexmedetomidine for sedation in adult patients in the ICU receiving MV. All concluded that use of dexmedetomidine may be associated with cost savings, but these studies were conducted before recent issues about the safety of dexmedetomidine were published, and none included clonidine. In addition, dexmedetomidine is now available off patent at substantially lower cost than Dexdor (UK licensed brand; Orion Pharma) and Precedex (US licensed brand; Pfizer). We therefore undertook an economic evaluation to investigate the cost-effectiveness of dexmedetomidine-, clonidine-, and propofol-based IV sedation using A2B trial data.

### Role of dexmedetomidine for the prevention and treatment of delirium in intensive care unit patients [^112h5szx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review recent clinical studies regarding the role of dexmedetomidine for prevention and treatment of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and PubMed searches (1988-Feburary 2013) were conducted, using the key words delirium, dexmedetomidine, Precedex, agitation, α-2 agonists, critical care, and intensive care. References from relevant articles were reviewed for additional information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives/analgesics or with antipsychotics for delirium were selected. Studies that evaluated the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation for more than 6 hours were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α-2 receptor agonist that provides sedation, anxiolysis, and modest analgesia with minimal respiratory depression. Its mechanism of action is unique compared with that of traditional sedatives because it does not act on γ-aminobutyric acid receptors. In addition, dexmedetomidine lacks anticholinergic activity and promotes a natural sleep pattern. These pharmacologic characteristics may explain the possible anti delirium effects of dexmedetomidine. Eight clinical trials, including 5 double-blind randomized trials, were reviewed to evaluate the impact of dexmedetomidine on ICU delirium.

Conclusions

Currently available evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is a promising agent, not only for prevention but also for treatment of ICU-associated delirium. However, larger, well-designed trials are warranted to define the role of dexmedetomidine in preventing and treating delirium in the ICU.

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex) [^115aDbKE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively.

Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after Precedex maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for > 24 hours were similar to the PK parameters after Precedex maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies. The values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and t₁/₂ were 39.4 L/hr, 152 L, and 2.67 hours, respectively.

Distribution

The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of Precedex that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.

The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro, and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of Precedex were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by Precedex was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by Precedex.

### Dexmedetomidine use in pediatric airway reconstruction [^112CL6Uh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Assess the postoperative use of dexmedetomidine (Precedex) in pediatric patients following airway reconstruction.

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary medical center.

Subjects and Methods

A retrospective review of 24 children undergoing laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) or laryngeal cleft repair (LCR) was conducted. Twelve children were treated with standard sedation protocols where dexmedetomidine was administered in lieu of propofol (Diprivan); 12 age-, gender-, and procedure-matched controls were selected. Subjects were divided into groups based on duration of postoperative intubation for cross-comparison; group 1 was intubated < 24 hours, group 2 was intubated 2 to 6 days, and group 3 was intubated 7 days or longer. Baseline heart rate and blood pressure measurements were compared to hourly measurements for the first 6 hours following initiation of dexmedetomidine or mechanical ventilation in the control group. Number of supportive respiratory interventions, adverse events, self-extubations, premature termination of dexmedetomidine, amount of muscle relaxants, agents to treat withdrawal, and length of stay were evaluated.

Results

Ten patients undergoing LTR and 2 patients undergoing LCR receiving dexmedetomidine were compared to 10 LTR and 2 LCR control patients. Overall, dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and without significant adverse effects, particularly in cases of short-term intubation or as a bridge to extubation.

Conclusion

In cases requiring short-term intubation following airway reconstruction, dexmedetomidine may offer a safe alternative to propofol by providing readily reversible sedation during the periextubation period. Further studies are needed to determine the safety, efficacy, dosing, and potential complications of longer term dexmedetomidine administration in pediatric airway reconstruction.

### How does intraarticular dexmedetomidine injection effect articular cartilage and synovium? An animal study [^113Nkazt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only one published trial that assessed the effects of dexmedetomidine on equine chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, chondrocytes isolated from healthy articular cartilage in horses were treated with different concentrations (0.001–0.25 mg/ml) of dexmedetomidine for 15, 30, and 60 min. Dexmedetomidine reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. This effect of dexmedetomidine was evident only at concentrations of 0.175 mg/ml and 0.25 mg/ml. Signs of late apoptosis and necrosis were reported. That study offers recent insights into potential chondrotoxicity and warns us against the use of higher concentrations of intra-articular dexmedetomidine. The concentration of dexmedetomidine, which is manufactured for human use, is 0.1 mg/ml (Precedex©), and it is nearly impossible to use higher concentrations of this drug intraarticularly in humans. We investigated the effects of this concentration (the highest concentration manufactured to be used in humans) of dexmedetomidine in our trial to determine the possible histopathological adverse reactions.

### Dexmedetomidine-related atrial standstill and loss of capture in a pediatric patient after congenital heart surgery [^114TVAbt]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Dexmedetomidine (DEX; Precedex) is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that produces anxiolysis and sleep-like sedation without narcosis or respiratory depression and has relatively few cardiovascular side effects. Given its favorable sedative properties combined with its limited effects on hemodynamic and respiratory function, it is widely used in pediatric intensive care and anesthesia settings.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit.

Patient

A three-yr-old girl was admitted after mitral valve replacement for persistent severe mitral insufficiency. Her prior history was significant for tetralogy of Fallot which was repaired at nine months of age. A year later the patient developed mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency and subsequently underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair, pulmonary valve replacement, and a maze procedure (the latter was performed for persistent atrial flutter). Following that operation she developed sinus node dysfunction and had a permanent epicardial dual-chamber pacemaker implanted. Due to remaining severe mitral insufficiency the patient had increasing pulmonary symptoms, necessitating the most recent surgery to replace her mitral valve.

Interventions

On postoperative day two the patient was hemodynamically stable and weaning off mechanical ventilation. Tracheal extubation was anticipated to occur within the next 24 hrs. A DEX infusion of 0.6 mcg/kg/hr was initiated. A pacemaker interrogation performed on postoperative day three, 21 hrs after the initiation of DEX, revealed unsuccessful atrial capture.

Measurements and Main Results

Dexmedetomidine was subsequently discontinued and the patient's pacemaker was reinterrogated. The interrogation findings were similar to those seen prior to the initiation of DEX.

Conclusion

As a result of these findings, caution is warranted in the administration of DEX to patients with predisposing conduction abnormalities and patients who are pacemaker-dependent.

### A randomized, controlled trial on dexmedetomidine for providing adequate sedation and hemodynamic control for awake, diagnostic transesophageal echocardiography [^112pJ4aF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become established as a sensitive and accurate diagnostic method for the rapid assessment of myocardial function. It was theorized that dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL) might prove to be useful for sedating patients while undergoing TEE.

Design

A prospective, randomized trial was designed comparing dexmedetomidine versus standard therapy (eg, midazolam and opioids) for sedation.

Setting

This trial was performed in a tertiary care, single-institution university hospital.

Participants

Males and females, American Society of Anesthesiologists I to IV, ages 18 to 65 years, requiring diagnostic TEE. Patients were excluded if pregnant, if they had taken benzodiazepines or opioids within 24 hours, or if they were deemed to be too unstable to receive any kind of sedation.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to standard therapy or dexmedetomidine infusion groups. Sedation was assessed at 6 time points. Pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, and respiratory rate were monitored. Additional variables measured were the amount of each drug given, the time of the TEE procedure, and the time to recovery.

Measurements and Main Results

A survey about the quality of sedation, the level of comfort, and whether or not they would accept this type of sedation again was administered after recovery from sedation. Demographic data and patient questionnaire responses were reported as means and standard errors or percents and were analyzed with the t test and chi-square test. Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Hemodynamics were statistically different between the two groups at several time points. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were elevated in the standard therapy group, whereas the dexmedetomidine group had a lower BP. Heart rate was elevated significantly in the standard therapy group compared with the dexmedetomidine group. There was no statistical or clinical difference between the groups in terms of oxygenation or respiratory rate.

Conclusions

The authors concluded that dexmedetomidine appears equivalent in achieving adequate levels of sedation without increasing the rate of respiratory depression or decreasing oxygen saturation compared with standard therapy, and it may be better in achieving desired hemodynamic results.

### Dexmedetomidine for the prevention of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^115URTit]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

This systematic review and meta-analysis with TSA adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement checklist, and was registered with INPLASY (INPLASY2024110008).

Search strategy

PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase were searched for relevant RCTs about the effect of dexmedetomidine on POD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery from inception to 1 November 2024. Additional records were identified from the reference sections of previous systematic reviews and eligible studies. The following terms were used in search strategies: ("dexmedetomidine" OR "MPV 1440" OR "precedex" OR "dexdor" OR "dexdomitor") AND ("delirium" OR "acute brain syndrome") AND ("random"). The detailed search strategies are shown in Additional file 1.

Eligibility criteria

Inclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Participant: patients undergoing off-pump or on-pump cardiac surgery. (2) Intervention: Intravenous dexmedetomidine. (3) Comparator: placebo or positive control. The nature of positive control included, but was not limited to, propofol, midazolam, and morphine. (4) Outcome: POD. (5) Study design: RCTs published in journals, written in English or Chinese, were included.

Exclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Non-intravenous dexmedetomidine. (2) Duplicate records. (3) Studies with insufficient information or data.

Endpoints

The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the incidence of POD, and the secondary outcome was the incidence of POAF. POD was measured using recognized assessment tools or scales, such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), the Confusion Assessment Method, the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, the Delirium Rating Scale, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, among others.

Study selection and data extraction

Two reviewers (YZ and ZR) independently performed searches of the databases and evaluated eligible articles. Any discrepancies were addressed by consulting a third reviewer (JG).

### Optimal dose of perineural dexmedetomidine to prolong analgesia after brachial plexus blockade: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 57 randomized clinical trials [^112CfPZt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This investigation followed the recommended process described in the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses " extension statement for reporting meta-analyses, and the protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY; registration number: INPLASY202110066). A preliminary search suggested that vast majority of the published comparisons of interest have been conducted in the setting of BPB. Consequently, we decided to focus on the population of patients having upper limb surgery under BPB.

Search strategy

Two authors (H Cai and X Fan) independently searched the electronic database including Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from inception date to Jan, 2021. The search was restricted to articles in the English language. The online literature was searched using the following combination of medical subject heading terms and entry terms: "Brachial Plexus Block" or "Block, Brachial Plexus" or "Blocks, Brachial Plexus" or "Brachial Plexus Blocks" or "Brachial Plexus Anesthesia" or "Anesthesia, Brachial Plexus" or "Brachial Plexus Blockade" or "Blockade, Brachial Plexus" or "Blockades, Brachial Plexus" or "Brachial Plexus Blockades" or "Plexus Blockade, Brachial" or "Plexus Blockades, Brachial". These search results were combined with "Dexmedetomidine" or "Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride" or "MPV-1440" or "MPV1440" or "Precedex" or "MPV 1440" or "Hydrochloride, Dexmedetomidine". We limited our search to title and abstract. Furthermore, the two authors (H Cai and X Fan) looked through the references of the relative papers to find additional studies.

### Computer vision detects covert voluntary facial movements in unresponsive brain injury patients [^1133iWcc]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sedation control and complications

Whenever clinically feasible, sedation was paused 15–30 min before each SeeMe session. For all patients on continuous sedation infusion, we categorized the level of sedation as light and deep based on medication type and dosage. We categorized the infusion rate of < 50 µg/kg/min of propofol –, 0.2–0.7 µg/kg/min of dexmedetomidine (Precedex), and 0.02–0.1 mg/kg/h of midazolamas light sedation, and infusion rates exceeding these thresholds as deep sedation. Fentanyl, which is commonly administered to patients with ABI, shows sedative effects only at high doses. Thus, we considered fentanyl dosage lower than 1.5 mcg/kg/h IV for pain control as light sedation. Due to the synergistic effects of Precedex and propofol, patients were classified as deep sedation with a propofol maintenance infusion threshold of 35 µg/kg/min when at least 0.5 µg/kg/h of Precedex was administered. We also reported the most common complications with potential influence on the level of consciousness that overlapped with SeeMe sessions within one week of incidence. Patients were then classified according to their sedation status/presence of concurrent complications and SeeMe video results (Supplementary Table 1).

### Dexmedetomidine sedation in painful posterior segment surgery [^112MUhB6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a case series on the use of dexmedetomidine (Precedex) sedation in painful posterior segment surgery performed under topical anesthesia, similar to its use in cataract surgery.

Methods

A prospective review of cases that had posterior segment surgery under topical anesthesia and that needed sedation. Dexmedetomidine-loading infusion was 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion (0.5 mcg/kg/h).

Results

NINE PATIENTS WERE OPERATED ON UNDER TOPICAL ANESTHESIA: two scleral buckle, five cryopexy, one scleral laceration, and one pars plana vitrectomy with very dense laser therapy in an albinotic fundus; six patients had retinal detachment. General or local anesthesia were not possible due to medical or ocular morbidities, use of anticoagulants, or the surgery plan changed intraoperatively when new pathologies were discovered. The surgeon achieved good surgical control in eight of nine cases, with one patient having ocular and bodily movements that were disturbing. Six patients had no pain, while three patients reported mild pain. No adverse effects were noted and all patients had successful surgical outcomes. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were well controlled throughout the procedures. The most frequent adverse reactions of dexmedetomidine reported in the literature in less than 5% (hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth) were not recorded in the present study.

Conclusion

When a surgeon has planned to do a pars plana vitrectomy under topical anesthesia and the surgical situation dictates the addition of cryopexy, scleral buckle, or intense laser retinopexy, then sedation with dexmedetomidine can help in the control of ocular pain in the majority of cases, with good intraoperative and immediate postoperative hemodynamic control with the possibility of supplemental rescue analgesia. Dexmedetomidine, a sedative analgesic, is devoid of respiratory depressant effects, and its use in posterior segment surgery under topical anesthesia is reported here for the first time.

### Effect of dexmedetomidine in the prophylactic endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices: a study protocol for prospective interventional study [^111Myp8d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX, Precedex; Hospira Japan Co. Osaka, Japan) is a novel, highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist characterised by its ability to elicit sedative, amnestic, sympatholytic and analgesic effects.DEX was globally first approved for its use in intensive care unit (ICU) in 1999, and its application has been extended since to several other clinical situations. In a phase III study of DEX, the administration of 0.2–0.7 µg/kg per hour of DEX resulted in clinically effective sedation and significantly reduced the analgesic requirements for ventilated patients in the ICU. A previous investigation has also demonstrated that DEX may be a possible alternative to MDZ for sedation. In general, DEX is preferred over MDZ, and seems to provide a more stable profiling, based on the observation of cardiopulmonary condition. Thus, DEX is being increasingly used in the sedation of patients in various clinical situations. In our country, DEX was first approved for health insurance for use in the ICU in 2004. In the field of endoscopic therapy, the demand for sedation methods that offer safety during local anaesthesia procedures has been increasing because most endoscopic procedures do not require general anaesthesia, and in 2013, the use of DEX was additionally approved for use in endoscopic therapies under local anaesthesia in Japan. Several Japanese investigators have reported on the clinical usefulness of DEX for sedation in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the treatment of early gastric or oesophageal cancers, or in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. To the best of our knowledge, however, there are no data on the usefulness and safety of DEX for sedation during endoscopic procedures for the treatment of OVs, such as during endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS).

Thus, the aim of the current study is to prospectively examine the safety and usefulness of DEX for sedation during prophylactic EIS (as a primary prophylaxis) for patients with OVs.

P409 Incidence of dexmedetomidine associated fever at a level 1 trauma center

NA Beaupre, JT Jancik

Hennepin County Medical Center, Pharmacy Department, Minneapolis, United States

Introduction: We evaluated the incidence of dexmedetomidine associated fever (DAF) in a level 1 trauma center's medical intensive care unit (MICU). Hypotension and bradycardia are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with dexmedetomidine (DEX) infusion. Case reports suggest DEX can cause fevers and the clinical trials that led to the approval of DEX demonstrated fever rate to be 4–5% [1].

Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the MICU at Hennepin County Medical Center between March and July of 2018 that were started on a DEX infusion. Patients were included if they were 18 years and older, on a DEX infusion for at least 12 hours, and had temperature data available. Fever was defined as > 38.3C and other causes of fever including infections, medications, withdrawal, recent surgery, thromboembolic disease, thyroid disorders and seizures were excluded from analysis.

Results: Of the 246 patients screened, 120 were included. The mean age was 50 years and 63.3% were males. Of all the patients included, the mean change in temperature after initiation of DEX infusion was +1.1C from baseline. The mean initial dose was 0.3 mcg/kg/hr. Four of 120 patients (3.3%) had a DAF. Of those that had a DAF, the median initial dose was 0.3 mcg/kg/hr; the median time of infusion was 43.5 hours; and the median cumulative dose was 0.57 mcg/kg/hr. The median time to fever after initiation of DEX was 7 hours, with a range of 5 to 20 hours. The median time to fever cessation after discontinuation of DEX was 3 hours.

Conclusions: In our population, the incidence of dexmedetomidine associated fever was relatively rare at 3.3% and similar to current literature rates.

Anesthesiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Availability and strength of evidence — preparation of the guidelines followed a rigorous methodological process using two principal sources: scientific evidence and opinion-based evidence, and findings are reported by evidence category, level, and direction. Category A evidence represents randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and Category B evidence represents observational results from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups, with Category A given precedence when available. Evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels, and only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention–outcome pair with a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality. For Category A, RCTs report comparative findings and statistically significant (P < 0.01) outcomes are designated as beneficial (B) or harmful (H), whereas statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E); Level 1 evidence consists of meta-analytic findings from a sufficient number of RCTs.

Blood Sampling and Sample Handling

After insertion of an IV catheter, a control blood sample was obtained; thereafter, DEX (Precedex; Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL) was administered as a single-dose IV infusion over 10–15 minutes (0.7 μg/kg). Venous blood samples (1 mL each) were obtained at the following time points after the end of the infusion: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300, 420, and 600 minutes. Each child contributed 2–5 samples; sampling times were randomly assigned.

The heparinized blood samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection, and the supernatant plasma was stored in plastic vials at −80°C until analysis.

Determination of DEX Concentration

The plasma concentration of DEX was analyzed using a validated, sensitive, and selective high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method as described previously. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 55,000 pg/mL with a correlation coefficient above 0.9995. The lower limit of quantification was 5 pg/mL with a relative standard deviation of < 15%. The intraday and interday coefficients of variation ranged between 5.6% and 11.2%.

Population PK Analysis

A population PK approach with a nonlinear mixed-effect model was implemented using the software program Monolix (version 4.4, Lixoft, Antony, France,), which combines the stochastic expectation maximization algorithm and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure for likelihood maximization.

### Effect of dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil for post-thoracotomy intravenous analgesia: a randomized, controlled clinical study [^1131otXx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative PCIA strategy

A standard sufentanil in PCIA protocol was adopted throughout the studied period. According to the randomization plan, the PCIA regimen consisted of sufentanil 3.0 μg.kg −1 and 8 mg ondansetron, mixed with 0.9% normal saline to a total volume of 250 ml. In the dexmedetomidine group, in addition to the sufentanil and ondansetron, 4.0 μg.kg −1 of dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Aibeinin ®, Inc. Henrui Pharmaceutical, China) was added to the PCIA solution and again the volume was made up to 250 mL with 0.9% normal saline. The PCIA was programmed to deliver a 2 mL bolus on-demand, with a lock-out interval of 10 min, and a background infusion rate of 4 ml.h −1. All patients received 20 mL i.v. of PCIA solution immediately after were attached a PCIA pump. During the study period after surgery, this PCIA programme thus allowed a continuous background infusion of sufentanil 0.048 μg.kg −1.h −1 and a bolus of sufentanil 0.024 μg.kg −1; and allowed a continuous background infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.064 μg.kg −1.h −1 and a bolus of dexmedetomidine 0.032 μg.kg −1. The PCIA was used for the first 48 h postoperatively. Upon arrival in the general ward, all the patients were once again instructed on the use of the PCIA pump and VAS shortly, and they were encouraged to push the PCIA button (self-administer their own PCA medications) to achieve an rescue analgesic when their could not tolerance pain throughout 48 h after operation.

### Adequate sedation with single-dose dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate with spinal anaesthesia: a dose-response study by age group [^111TBTdT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Clinical setting

The present study was performed at Severance Hospital from July 2012 to December 2013. This study was conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the Institutional Research Board of Severance Hospital (reference number 4-2011-0927) and all patients gave written informed consent. The study was registered at ClinicalTrails. Gov with the number NCT01665586. The patients were fully informed the sedation assessment during spinal anesthesia. Exclusion criteria included the infection on puncture sites, coagulopathy disorders, allergy to local anesthetics, psychiatric history, and neurological diseases. Forty-two patients of ASA physical status I or II and who were scheduled to undergo elective TURP were recruited. Subjects were divided into two groups by the patient's age. Patients in the young age group (Group Y) were between 45 and 64 years old and those in the old age group (Group O) were 65 to 78 years old. One anesthesiologist prepared the study drug (DMT) in a preparation room. All patients and the observational investigators were blinded to the administered dose of DMT. One millilitre (100 μg) of DMT (Precedex®, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, USA) was diluted with 49 mL of normal saline (2 μg/ml) in a 50 mL syringe.

### Safety and efficacy of a novel dexmedetomidine nasal spray for pre-anesthetic sedation in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115MgftA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we used the placebo as control because at the time of the study design, there is a scarcity of regulatory approved pediatric drugs. Dexmedetomidine injection (PRECEDEX®, Hospira Inc, Lake Forest, Illinois) was approved as sedative of non-intubated children prior to and during non-invasive procedures by the US FDA in December 2022. Other drugs used for pre-operative sedation, such as midazolam, are not currently available as regulatory-approved nasal sprays, which cannot meet the double-blind setting and are set up as active controls. The choice of control has been adequately discussed with and agreed upon by the health authority in the protocol development.

In this study, more children in the dexmedetomidine group vs the placebo group achieved the desired child-parent separation and Ramsay sedation scale ≥ 3 within 45 min, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) and clinically meaningful. The results of the secondary outcomes were supportive of the primary outcome. As compared with placebo, dexmedetomidine treatment elicited more effective child-parent separation and more potent pre-anesthetic sedation as assessed by Ramsay scale and UMSS. The recovery time in the dexmedetomidine group was longer than that in the placebo. Following sedation with dexmedetomidine or placebo, general anaesthesia was used during the scheduled elective surgery. Specifically, propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium bromide were used for the induction of anaesthesia, and remifentanil, propofol, fentanyl or sufentanil (as needed), and rocuronium bromide and cisatracurium (as needed) were used for the maintenance of anaesthesia. The dose of general anaesthesia was not adjusted based on sedation depth. Therefore, the use of dexmedetomidine on top of other anaesthesia might lead to the longer recovery time compared to placebo. Previous studies have also reported the prolonged recovery time with the use of dexmedetomidine as sedative. In this study, the median time to the onset of sedation as evaluated by the Ramsay sedation scale and UMSS was approximately 20 min. This was in accordance with a previous meta-analysis in which median time to the onset of action after intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine 1 to 4 µg/kg was 15–30 min.

### Combined use of dexmedetomidine and propofol in monitored anesthesia care: a randomized controlled study [^113Rcgqx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Study groups

There are three groups in this study. In the P group, 1.6 μg/ml of initial target effect site concentration (Ce) of propofol (2% Fresofol®, Fresenius Kabi, Korea Ltd, Korea) was infused through a TCI pump (Orchestra® Base Primea, Fresenius Kabi, Brezins, France). For dose maintenance, the propofol was titrated by 0.2 μg/ml of Ce depending on the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score. Patients in the D group received an infusion of 0.4 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Precedex®, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, USA) following a loading dose of 1.0 μg/kg over 10 min. And then, the dose of dexmedetomidine was adjusted by 0.08 μg/kg/h according to the OAA/S score. In the M group, 0.8 μg/ml of initial Ce of propofol was infused through an Orchestra® Base Primea TCI pump and a loading dose of dexmedetomidine of 0.5 μg/kg was infused over 10 min together. Then, 0.2 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine was infused for the maintenance dose. During the sedation, the maintenance doses of propofol and dexmedetomidine were titrated by the same proportion depending on the OAA/S score. The dose of propofol was adjusted by 0.2 μg/ml of Ce and the dose of dexmedetomidine was adjusted by 0.04 μg/kg/h simultaneously. The maintenance dose of each group was adjusted by one of the authors to maintain the OAA/S score of 3 in all study groups.

### Dexmedetomidine decreased the post-thyroidectomy bleeding by reducing cough and emergence agitation-a randomized, double-blind, controlled study [^115ENeSR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted after it was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chosun University Hospital (2014-04-004) and was registered at(registration number NCT02412150, 09/04/2015).

A total of 139 female patients who were undergoing elective total thyroidectomy under general anesthesia (ASA class 1–2, aged over 20–60 years) in our hospital were enrolled in the study. Patients with the following conditions were excluded: risk of a difficult airway, history of respiratory disease, chronic cough, cardiovascular disease, or pregnant or breast-feeding woman. All patients agreed to participate in the study after careful explanation, and written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained. The recruited patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio according to computer-generated random numbers, and sealed envelopes were prepared by an independent anesthesiologist. When the patients agreed to participate in the study, the envelopes were opened in sequential order and the patients were allocated according to the number into two groups: Group D (n = 69): Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) was administered (0.6 µg/kg/h) after stopping the administration of remifentanil 15 min before the end of surgery; Group S (n = 70): Normal saline was administered as a control in the same way. For blindness, an independent nurse and anesthesiologist who did not participate in the anesthetic procedure prepared the study drugs and assessed the outcomes. Dexmedetomidine, which was diluted to a 50 mL volume (diluted to 0.2 µg/mL) and normal saline were prepared in a code-labeled 50-mL syringe according to the coded number of the patients.

### Comparative study of fentanyl vs dexmedetomidine as adjuvants to intrathecal bupivacaine in cesarean section: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^112CsrJn]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Procedures and Intervention

When patients entered the operating room, basic standard monitoring, including noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography and pulse oximetry were done, and initial hemodynamic parameters were measured. Before the initiation of spinal block, all patients received 10 mL/kg Ringer solution. All 110 patients were randomly and equally divided into the following two groups:
Group B-D received 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%+5 μg dexmedetomidine (Precedex TM 200 μg/2 mL Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL, USA)
Group B-F received 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%+25 μg fentanyl (ROTEXMEDICA 0.5 mg/10 mL Trittau, Germany)

The total volume of intrathecal injection in both groups was equal (2.5 mL).

Aseptic technique with 25 G Quincke spinal needle was used for spinal anesthesia in all study subjects by an anesthesiologist in the sitting position at the level of L4-L5 intervertebral space. After observing free flow of transparent cerebrospinal fluid, the intrathecal drugs were injected. Then, patients were positioned to supine (slightly tilted to the left side) and 6 L/min oxygen was delivered with a simple face mask. The sensory block was checked by the pinprick test, and motor block was assessed using the Bromage scale. When the adequate level of sensory block (T4-T6) was reached and confirmed, the surgery was allowed to begin.

### The timing of administration of intravenous dexmedetomidine during lower limb surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^115sfmPC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Preoperative preparations and anesthesia protocol

No premedication was administered to the patients. While in the operating room, all patients were monitored by electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and bispectral index (BIS) values. Before SA, crystalloid 6 mL/kg was intravenously injected to the patients for hydration. A nurse who did not participate in this study prepared a 50 mL mixture of normal saline 48 mL and DEX (Precedex®, Hospira Inc. Rocky Mount, NC, USA) 200 μg. An anesthesiologist who did not participate in this study performed SA. Patients were randomly assigned to Group A and B (n = 37, each group). Patients were intravenously administered 1 μg/kg of DEX for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of DEX 0.2 μg/kg/hr. Group A and B were administered DEX after and before 5 min of spinal anesthesia. Patients were placed in the lateral decubitus position and a spinal tap in the L3/4 or L4/5 intervertebral space was performed using the midline approach. After confirming the free flow of the cerebrospinal fluid, 0.5% heavy bupivacaine (Marcaine®, AstraZeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden) 12 mg was injected intrathecally. We evaluated the disappearance of pinprick sensation by using a needle in the mid-clavicular line. In addition, we confirmed the extent of motor blockade by using the modified Bromage scale. The administration of DEX was discontinued when the surgeon began to suture. Following arrival in the PACU, patients stayed for one hour. The patients were discharged from the PACU when the modified Aldrete score was ≥ 9.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Sedation for Non-Invasive Procedures

The safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age.

Pediatric use information is approved for Hospira Inc.'s PRECEDEXTM (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) injection. However, due to Hospira Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

ICU Sedation

The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine have not been established in pediatric patients for ICU sedation. One assessor-blinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for ICU sedation. These studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of dexmedetomidine for these patient populations.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Intensive Care Unit Sedation

A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over. In patients greater than 65 years of age, a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of dexmedetomidine injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Therefore, a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Epidural dexmedetomidine infusion for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery: randomized trial [^111PQo6n]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

After initial blind placement of the epidural catheter, we injected 2 mL of a nonionic contrast dye through the catheter, then anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic images were obtained for further confirmation of the desired epidural location. An anesthesiologist (not involved in the study) prepared the coded study drug solutions and then handed them over to the attending senior staff anesthesiologist for epidural administration.

According to the randomization code for each patient, for group bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine, we injected the patients with a bolus dose of 6 mL of bupivacaine, 0.1% + dexmedetomidine, 0.5 µg/mL via the epidural catheter before skin incision, followed by a continuous epidural infusion of 6 mL/h of bupivacaine 0.1% + dexmedetomidine, 0.5 µg/mL throughout the operative period and continued for 48 hours postoperatively, and for group bupivacaine, we injected the patients with a bolus dose of 6 mL of bupivacaine, 0.1% through the epidural catheter before skin incision, followed by a continuous epidural infusion of 6 mL/h of bupivacaine, 0.1% through the operative period and sustained for 48 hours postoperatively. The epidural administered medications were prepared as follow, for bupivacaine group, 10 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% dissolved in 40 mL normal saline to obtain bupivacaine concentration of 0.1% and for group bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine, 10 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%+1 mL (25 µg) dexmedetomidine (Precedex ®; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) dissolved in 39 mL normal saline to obtain bupivacaine concentration of 0.1% and dexmedetomidine concentration of 0.5 µg/mL and delivered through a 50 mL syringe pump (Perfusor ® compact S; B Braun, Melsungen, Germany).

Following the placement of the epidural, capnogram monitoring was initiated to evaluate respiratory status, provided that the patient's vital signs and comfort levels were stable. Sedatives were carefully selected based on their minimal respiratory impact, rapid onset, short duration, and the availability of reversal agents. The MAC protocol was subsequently commenced, involving a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (Precedex ®) at 0.5–1 mcg/kg infused over 10–20 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5–0.7 mcg/kg/h. Additionally, remifentanil was administered at a concentration of 20 mcg/mL, infused at a rate of 5–7 mL/h, and Midazolam was administered in doses of 1 to 2 mg, tailored to the patient's age, sex, and calculated adjusted body weight. An extra dose of 1 mg of midazolam was administered each hour. The dosages of these medications were fine-tuned based on continuous evaluations of the patient's respiratory function and sedation level. In instances where the patient became unresponsive to noxious stimuli, the oxygen flow was increased to 6 L. A small pillow was positioned beneath the rectangular face-protection cushion to facilitate the sniffing position and thus improve airway patency. If the capnogram indicated unstable breathing, an oral or nasal airway was inserted, the oxygen delivery method was switched to a simple mask, and the oxygen flow was increased to approximately 10 L to maintain an FiO₂ of about 0.6. Furthermore, we temporarily discontinued or reduced the dosage of remifentanil, noted for its short context-sensitive half-time. Dosages of midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and remifentanil were adjusted according to the patient's age, weight, and level of sedation.

### Surgical correction of a ventricular septal defect in a child with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 treated with nusinersen sodium: a case report [^116NR4bK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The second admission of the patient was at age 17 months. The pulmonary band gradient was 78 mmHg, and pulse oxygen saturation was 93. No neurologic deterioration was noted, patient was able to hold her head, sit unsupported and the weighed 8.2 kg. We performed atrial and ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary artery reconstruction. Neuromuscular blockade was established with Rocuronium 4 mg; sedation was applied with Pentothal 25 mg, Dormicum 0.5 mg, Fentanyl 16 mg, and maintained with Precedex 0.1 mg/kg/h and Sevoflurane 0.6–0.7 MAC. The patient was weaned and extubated in the operating room. Postoperative echocardiographic evaluation showed a trivial residue on ventricular septal defect and a 14 mmHg gradient on the pulmonary artery (Additional file 2: Fig. S2). The patient was transferred to the ward on the post-operative 2nd day and discharged on the 9th day. Thirteen months and eighteen months after the second operation, before and after her fifth dose, the patient's Hammersmith score was 25 and 41, accordingly. In the patient's recent follow-up at age of four, cardiac assessments were normal. In her physical and neurological examination, patient had a positive Gower's sign with evident hypotonia but could walk unsupported, reported improvement in motor skills with continuing treatment and received a Hammersmith score of 64 (Additional file 3: Fig. S3).

### Efficacy of combination therapy with dexmedetomidine for benzodiazepines-induced disinhibition during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^113vHK1p]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

System and monitoring

At our institution, conscious sedation was administered by a single sedation physician (nonanesthesiologist) in addition to the investigator. Patient characteristics, including age, sex, height, and body weight, were measured before ERCP. Oxygen was administered (2 l/min) using a nasal cannula before the administration of sedation. Blood pressure, heart rate, and percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO₂) were measured by monitor before the administration of sedation and monitored every 5 min during the procedure.

DEX group

The initial dose of DEX (Precedex Syringe; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) was 6 μg/kg/h for a 10-min loading, followed by 0.4 μg/kg/h continued by intravenous administration during the procedure. Blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO₂ were measured very 2 min during loading. After 10 min, this was switched to monitoring every 5 min. Diazepam (5–10 mg; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and 35 mg meperidine (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) were intravenously injected before insertion of the scope. When conscious sedation was shallow, an additional dose of 5 mg diazepam was intravenously administered to achieve a Ramsay sedation scale(RSS) of 4–5. Meperidine (35 mg) was intravenously administered when analgesia was insufficient.

BZD group

Diazepam (5–10 mg; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) or 2.5–5 mg midazolam (Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) as a sedative, and 35 mg meperidine (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) were intravenously injected before insertion of the scope. When conscious sedation was shallow, an additional dose of 5 mg diazepam or 2.5 mg midazolam was intravenously administered to achieve an RSS of 4–5. Meperidine (35 mg) was intravenously administered when analgesia was insufficient.

Variables

The primary outcome was a sedation level according to RSS. Secondary outcomes were movement score, completion rate of the procedure, the number of additional sedatives, and adverse events. Movement scoreswere defined as shown in Table 1. Blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO₂ were measured continuously during sedation; presedation and minimum values were assessed. Adverse events were as follows: hypotension with a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, bradycardia with a heart rate < 50 beats per min (bpm), and respiratory depression with SpO₂ < 90%.

### Patient participation in clinical trials of oncology drugs and biologics preceding approval by the US food and drug administration [^116TPVgr]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Several studies have estimated the financial inputs for successful drug development. Such analyses do not capture the large investment that patient study participants commit to drug development.

Objective

To estimate the volume of patients required to achieve a first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a new anticancer drug or biologic therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included a random sample of prelicense oncology drugs and biologics with a trial site in the United States that were launched into clinical efficacy testing between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Drugs and biologics were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. Total patient enrollment was captured over an 8-year span, and each intervention was classified based on whether it received FDA approval and was deemed as having intermediate or substantial value according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework (ASCO-VF) score. Secondarily, the association between patient numbers and intervention characteristics was tested. Data were analyzed in February 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measure

The prespecified primary outcome was the number of patients enrolled in prelicense trials per FDA approval.

Results

A total of 120 drugs and biologics were included in our study, with 84 (70.0%) targeted agents, 20 (16.7%) immunotherapies, and 71 (59.2%) novel agents. A total of 13 drugs and biologics (10.8%; 95% CI, 5.3%-16.8%) in our sample gained FDA approval within 8 years, of which 1 (7.7%) was deemed of intermediate value and 3 (23.1%) were deemed of substantial value using ASCO-VF scoring. Overall, 158 810 patients were enrolled in 1335 trials testing these drugs and biologics, 47 913 (30.2%) in trials that led to FDA approval and 110 897 (69.8%) in trials that did not. An estimated 12 217 (95% CI, 7970–22 215) patient study participants contributed to prelicense trials per FDA approval. The estimated number of patients needed to produce a single FDA-approved drug or biologic of intermediate or substantial ASCO-VF clinical value was 39 703 (95% CI, 19 391–177 991).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study make visible the substantial patient investment required for prelicense oncology drug development. Such analyses can be used to devise policies that maximize the clinical impact of research on a per-patient basis.

### A blood test for Alzheimer's disease: It's about time or not ready for prime time? [^117TQGrR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

A blood test for Alzheimer's disease is now available for clinical use in persons with cognitive impairment. This is an extraordinary milestone, though the amyloid-based PrecivityAD™ test is not without limitations. Pre and post-test counseling are essential. Phosphorylated tau blood tests are likely to follow soon. When used in conjunction with an appropriate clinical evaluation, blood tests provide the opportunity for an early, accurate, and accessible diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Standalone use, however, carries a significant risk of misinterpretation and is strongly discouraged. Now is the time to develop appropriate use criteria to guide the use of these promising assays.

### How to design a pre-specified statistical analysis approach to limit p-hacking in clinical trials: the pre-SPEC framework [^1122kXQa]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although this framework was developed with a trial's primary outcome in mind, it could also be used for secondary outcomes. As above, where investigators feel that specifying this information would pose an insurmountable barrier to the timely start of the trial, then investigators should simply specify the planned analysis approach as soon after the trial has begun as possible. Importantly, we note that our framework does not require that a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan be written before the trial begins.

We note that the Pre-SPEC framework is not intended to preclude changes or force investigators to stick with an analysis strategy they feel is no longer appropriate. There are sometimes good reasons for investigators to change their statistical methods during the course of the trial, for instance because of an advance in statistical methodology or the implementation of new methods in statistical software packages. Instead, if it is anticipated beforehand that the preferred method of analysis may depend on some aspect of the trial data (for instance, the distribution of outcome data), then the manner in which this decision will be made should be pre-specified, and if the analysis strategy needs to change due to an unanticipated issue (for instance, the occurrence of unanticipated intercurrent events, or new methodology becoming available in statistical software packages), then these changes should be documented and explained. Instead of preventing useful or necessary changes, Pre-SPEC simply increases transparency around the process; as stated in the SPIRIT guidelines, 'An unambiguous, complete, and transparent description of statistical methods facilitates execution, replication, critical appraisal, and the ability to track any changes from the original pre-specified methods'.

### How to design a pre-specified statistical analysis approach to limit p-hacking in clinical trials: the pre-SPEC framework [^116ggJoK]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Example

We now illustrate our framework in an example. Consider the following analysis section from a trial protocol for a continuous primary outcome measured at multiple follow-up time points:

'Primary analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis, including all participants as randomised, regardless of treatment actually received. The intervention group will be compared with the control group using a planned contrast of change from baseline to the week 12 endpoint using a mixed-model repeated measures analysis. Stratification variables will be evaluated and retained in analyses where they are measured as significant or quasi-significant. Transformation of outcomes, including categorisation, may be undertaken to meet distributional assumptions and accommodate outliers'.
Evaluating whether the analysis approach is designed to prevent p-hacking

This analysis approach meets our first two points; it was described in the trial protocol before recruitment began and consists of a single overall analysis strategy.

For our third point, the analysis approach covers three analysis aspects (population, analysis model, covariates); however, it does not specify how missing data will be handled. We can guess that participants with missing outcome data at all follow-up time points will be excluded from the analysis; however, this is not entirely clear.

For our fourth point, there is insufficient detail for a third party to independently replicate the analysis model; there are numerous ways to implement a mixed-model repeated measures analysis (for instance, different approaches to specifying random-effects, or different correlation structures to model the correlation between outcomes from the same participant at different time points), and it is not clear which approach the authors intend to use.

For our fifth point, the authors plan to use an adaptive analysis strategy for two components: which stratification variables to include in the analysis, and whether to transform the outcome (and if so, which transformation to use). In both instances, they do not include deterministic decision rules on how the final analysis approach should be decided (e.g. for stratification variables, there is no definition of what quasi-significant means). Therefore, this strategy would allow investigators to perform multiple analyses on the final trial data before choosing their preferred approach.

Overall, the specified analysis approach could allow investigators to implement a number of different analysis strategies (relating to handling of missing data, the analysis model, covariates, and transformation of the outcome) and present the most favourable result. As such, although this approach has been pre-specified, it still allows p-hacking.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.
