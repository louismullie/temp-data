## Question

Carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis and management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and which tools to use when. Next, I will review non-surgical management and its evidence. After that, I need to examine surgical indications and technique selection. Finally, I should consider perioperative care, special populations, and how to monitor outcomes, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pretest probability. Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve under the transverse carpal ligament, typically causing nocturnal paresthesias in the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger, with possible thenar weakness or atrophy in more severe cases; prevalence in adults is roughly 2.7–4.9% and incidence about 329 per 100,000 person-years, which helps frame pretest probability in primary care settings [^17533b67] [^f80edbf0].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to tests. I initially thought electrodiagnostic studies were broadly required, but hold on, I should double-check current guidance. The 2025 AAOS/ASSH guideline strongly recommends that the CTS-6 clinical tool can be used in place of routine ultrasound or nerve conduction studies/EMG for diagnosis, reserving ultrasound or electrodiagnostics for atypical presentations, diagnostic uncertainty, or when severity grading will change management; this is a shift from older paradigms that favored routine EDS [^2e27bd00] [^c5fba5c0] [^2b2a723c]. I should confirm that CTS-6 correlates with electrodiagnostics; yes, correlation with NCV/EMG can be as high as 0.9 in supporting studies, which supports its use as a first-line diagnostic tool in typical cases [^c5fba5c0].

> I need to check the role of ultrasound and MRI more precisely. Ultrasound measurement of median nerve cross-sectional area is a reasonable alternative when available, with sensitivity and specificity around 91% and 93% respectively, and can be considered particularly when structural assessment is needed or EDS is undesirable; however, routine MRI and upper limb neurodynamic testing are not recommended for diagnosis due to limited utility and cost, so I should avoid those unless there is a specific indication such as mass lesion suspicion or atypical findings [^c5fba5c0] [^4fe9f1ab] [^f10929f5]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment; AANEM supports ultrasound in selected cases, and AAFP and ACR suggest ultrasound or MRI when imaging is needed after normal radiographs in chronic wrist pain, which aligns with a selective, not routine, approach [^2aa9ae94] [^048843ca].

> Next, I should review non-surgical management and its evidence. Let me consider splinting first. Nighttime neutral-angle wrist splinting is a reasonable initial option for mild-to-moderate CTS, with about 37% success in some series, though many patients ultimately progress to surgery; I should counsel on this limitation and monitor closely for deterioration or lack of improvement [^aab6c4a6] [^6741779b]. I should confirm exercise-based approaches; a combined orthotic/stretching program can be considered in mild-to-moderate disease without thenar atrophy, with monitoring for clinically meaningful change, acknowledging that evidence quality varies and patient selection matters [^b9223992]. But wait, what about corticosteroid injections? Strong evidence shows no long-term benefit from local corticosteroid injection, though short-term symptom relief is possible; thus, injections may be used judiciously for transient relief but should not be relied upon for durable management, and I need to ensure patients understand this trade-off [^76b28c39] [^94aeee89]. I should double-check other modalities; therapeutic ultrasound has high-quality evidence against long-term benefit, and neurodynamic mobilization has insufficient evidence, so I should not position these as core treatments [^c1f72fe7] [^ab144e0c].

> I will now examine surgical indications and technique selection. Severe CTS with thenar atrophy, persistent sensory loss, or significant weakness warrants surgical decompression, as does failure of non-surgical care after a reasonable trial, typically 4–6 months, with shared decision-making about timing and patient preferences [^e74a7d3a]. Hold on, I should verify technique equivalence. High-quality evidence shows no difference in patient-reported outcomes between mini-open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release, though endoscopic release may allow earlier return to work by about a week in some studies but can carry higher costs and, in some series, more complications; therefore, surgeon experience and patient factors should guide the choice, and both are acceptable [^95220743] [^c247a15f]. I need to ensure I mention site of service; limited evidence suggests office-based carpal tunnel release can be safe in selected patients, but evidence quality is low and patient selection is key, so I should be cautious in generalizing this approach [^2b8b073a].

> Let me think about perioperative care and what to avoid. Routine preoperative testing such as labs, chest radiograph, or ECG is not indicated in otherwise healthy patients undergoing carpal tunnel release, and this should be communicated to avoid low-value care and delays [^e3aa59e6] [^95827584]. I should confirm pain control recommendations; NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen are strongly recommended for postoperative pain, and tramadol may be considered if needed, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^54d8d5e2] [^eadbf628]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said routine postoperative immobilization helps recovery; I should correct that. Routine immobilization is not recommended after standard carpal tunnel release, and supervised hand therapy is not routinely indicated, though selective use may help patients with stiffness or specific needs; this helps reduce unnecessary costs and delays in recovery [^5f85ac5d] [^02ab67c6]. I need to check anticoagulation guidance; in patients on anticoagulation, continuing therapy through the procedure is reasonable in many cases, with individualized risk assessment and local protocols guiding decisions [^b0f28ecb].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has atypical features? In pregnancy, CTS is common and often resolves postpartum; conservative measures such as splinting and activity modification are first-line, and local corticosteroid injection can be considered if symptoms are severe, with surgery reserved for refractory cases after delivery when feasible; I should tailor counseling accordingly [^002d1609]. If there are red flags for systemic disease or bilateral severe disease, I should consider amyloidosis screening, and when risk factors are present, tenosynovial biopsy at the time of release can detect amyloid in a meaningful minority, potentially triggering disease-modifying therapy; this is a consensus option rather than a mandate, so shared decision-making is essential [^83dbc05d] [^a1e51be5].

> Next, I should review how to monitor outcomes and define success. For non-surgical care, I should track symptom severity, nocturnal symptoms, provocative test responses, and functional status, and use validated tools such as the CTQ-SSS to quantify change over time; if there is no improvement within the agreed trial period, I should escalate to surgical consultation [^a50162d6] [^6741779b]. For surgical care, I should confirm that routine supervised therapy is not required and focus on return to function, scar management, and symptom resolution, referring for therapy only if stiffness, weakness, or other specific issues emerge [^02ab67c6]. I should double-check that sensory testing like two-point discrimination or vibration is not recommended for routine post-treatment assessment; indeed, evidence is insufficient for these modalities to track change, so I should avoid them for monitoring [^94fa2c31] [^ff58bc27].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world practice gaps so I can counsel accurately. Despite guideline shifts, many hand surgeons still routinely order electrodiagnostic studies, often citing severity grading, medicolegal contexts, or baseline documentation; this underscores the need to align testing with pretest probability and clinical questions rather than habit, and to communicate why CTS-6 can safely reduce unnecessary testing in typical cases [^c1a82c30] [^e4952bcd]. I need to ensure my approach remains evidence-aligned and adaptable as new data emerge, including ongoing questions about office-based surgery, cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies, and patient-centered outcomes that drive shared decision-making [^29eed25d] [^9fed1076].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically with CTS-6 in typical presentations, reserve ultrasound or electrodiagnostics for atypical or uncertain cases, start with splinting and targeted exercises for mild-to-moderate disease while setting expectations about limited long-term efficacy of injections, proceed to carpal tunnel release for severe disease or failed conservative care, choose open versus endoscopic technique based on surgeon expertise and patient priorities, avoid low-value perioperative practices, and monitor with validated outcomes tools, adjusting the plan through shared decision-making at each step [^2e27bd00] [^c5fba5c0] [^95220743] [^54d8d5e2] [^a50162d6].

---

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is best diagnosed by **clinical assessment plus electrodiagnostics** when needed [^2b2a723c], reserving ultrasound or MRI for atypical cases or surgical planning [^048843ca] [^57861148]. Management should be **individualized**: start with night splinting and activity modification for mild-to-moderate CTS, and consider corticosteroid injection for short-term relief; refer for surgery if symptoms persist or are severe, with open and endoscopic release yielding similar long-term outcomes [^95220743] [^5308c937]. Routine postoperative therapy or immobilization is not required [^02ab67c6], and preoperative testing is unnecessary unless indicated [^e3aa59e6]. Patient education and shared decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes [^adda19e3].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

CTS presents with **nocturnal paresthesia**, pain, and weakness in the median nerve distribution; thenar atrophy indicates severe disease [^f80edbf0]. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by provocative tests (Phalen, Tinel, Durkan compression) [^e74a7d3a] and, when uncertain or before surgery, **electrodiagnostic studies (NCS/EMG)** to confirm and grade severity [^2b2a723c] [^e74a7d3a]. Ultrasound can aid diagnosis and identify structural causes, while MRI is reserved for atypical or complex cases [^2aa9ae94] [^048843ca].

---

## Non-surgical management

Non-surgical care is appropriate for mild-to-moderate CTS or when surgery is contraindicated:

- **Night splinting**: Neutral-angle wrist splints at night reduce symptoms and improve function [^aab6c4a6].
- **Activity modification**: Ergonomic adjustments and task modification help reduce symptoms [^notfound].
- **Corticosteroid injections**: Provide short-term relief but no long-term benefit; use selectively [^76b28c39] [^94aeee89].
- **Exercise programs**: Combined orthotic/stretching may help mild-to-moderate CTS without thenar atrophy [^b9223992].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for severe CTS (thenar atrophy, constant numbness, or significant weakness) or for persistent symptoms despite 3–6 months of conservative care [^e74a7d3a]. Open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release have similar long-term outcomes; endoscopic release may allow faster return to work but has higher costs and a steeper learning curve [^95220743] [^c247a15f]. Office-based release is feasible in selected patients, but evidence is limited [^2b8b073a].

---

## Perioperative and postoperative care

Routine preoperative testing is unnecessary unless indicated by comorbidities [^e3aa59e6] [^95827584]. Postoperative pain is managed with NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen; opioids are rarely needed [^54d8d5e2] [^ace04929]. Routine immobilization or supervised therapy is not required; early motion is encouraged, with therapy reserved for stiffness or delayed recovery [^02ab67c6] [^5f85ac5d].

---

## Special considerations

Pregnancy-related CTS is common and usually resolves postpartum; **conservative measures** are first-line, with surgery reserved for severe or refractory cases [^002d1609]. Workers' compensation cases may require additional documentation and objective testing to support the diagnosis and treatment plan [^c1a82c30].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Education on CTS, treatment options, and expected outcomes is essential for adherence and satisfaction [^adda19e3]. Follow-up should monitor symptoms, function, and complications, with **shared decision-making** guiding care [^4dd01d37].

---

CTS management should be **evidence-based and individualized**, balancing non-surgical and surgical options to optimize outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^95fb97e8]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, management of CTS has shifted as well. Although for many patients the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide what diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications especially in high-risk patients, and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings in order to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. In this article, we approach commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and take a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^59d310ab]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are recognised widely and various treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome and to guide treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, but their exact benefit to patients is unknown. Although the best means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) clinical practice guideline introduction — scope, methods, and intended users are described, stating that the guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and that it provides recommendations to help practitioners integrate current evidence and clinical practice. The purpose is to evaluate the current best evidence associated with treatment, with a systematic review of the literature in publication conducted between March 2022 and August 2023, and AAOS staff methodologists assisted the physician/clinician work group in evaluating the existing literature. Intended users include orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare providers managing carpal tunnel syndrome, and in April 2019, the AAOS adopted the use of the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework into its clinical practice guideline development methodology. The guideline is presented as an educational tool, should not be construed as including all possible methods of care or excluding acceptable interventions similarly directed at obtaining favorable outcomes, and the final decision to use a specific procedure must be made after assessing all concerns presented by the patient and consideration of locality-specific resources. It is not intended for use as a benefits determination document, does not cover allocation of resources, business and ethical considerations, and users may also want to consider the appropriate use criteria (AUC) related to the management of carpal tunnel syndrome.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. To provide the evidence foundation for this AUC, the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine Unit provided the writing panel and voting panel with the 2016 AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline titled Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline. The Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications typical of patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome in clinical practice, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature to identify the appropriateness of treatments. The 135 patient scenarios and 6 treatments were developed by the writing panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

AAOS carpal tunnel syndrome guideline methods and evidence grading describe that this clinical practice guideline evaluates the management of carpal tunnel syndrome and uses methods to minimize bias and enhance transparency in selection, appraisal, and analysis. The approach incorporates practicing physicians (clinical experts) and methodologists who are free of potential conflicts of interest, and the development group held an introductory meeting on March 6th, 2022 to establish scope by creating PICO Questions (i.e., population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) that directed the literature search, which the medical librarian conducted using key terms from the PICO questions. Articles considered were published prior to the start date of the search in a minimum of three electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A CQV methodologist will review/include only primary literature, supplement with a manual search of bibliographies of secondary literature sources, evaluate recalled articles based on study selection criteria, and summarize the evidence for the guideline work group; a study attrition diagram is provided detailing the numbers of identified abstracts, recalled and selected studies, and excluded studies. The quality of evidence for a recommendation is determined by the quality and quantity of included literature, and statements with evidence from two or more "High" quality studies are considered to have "High Quality Evidence".

### Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Controversies in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^57861148]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder responsible for considerable patient suffering and cost to health services. Despite extensive research, controversies still exist with regards to best practice in diagnosis, treatment, and service provision. Current best practise would support the use of history, examination and electro-diagnostic studies. The role for ultrasound scanning in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is yet to be proven. It appears magnetic resonance image scanning has a role where a rare cause for carpal tunnel syndrome may be suspected and also in the detailed reconstruction of the anatomy to aid endoscopic procedures. Treatment options can be surgical or non-surgical and patient choice will dictate the decision. For non-surgical interventions many options have been trialled but until now only steroid use, acupuncture, and splinting have shown discernable benefits. Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel appears to be more simple and cost-effective than minimally invasive interventions. For those patients who reject surgery, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injection can play a role. Recent work looking at different service delivery options has shown some positive results in terms of decreasing patient waiting time for definitive treatment. However, no formal cost-effectiveness analysis has been published and concerns exist about the impact of a stream-lined service on surgical training. In this review, we look at the different diagnostic and treatment options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome. We then consider the different service delivery options and finally the cost-effectiveness evidence.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Create a safe and effective plan for management of carpal tunnel syndrome. 2. Support his or her rationale for the use of diagnostic tests. 3. Discuss elements of management that have been controversial, including anesthesia, the use of a tourniquet, postoperative pain control, and cost of care.

Summary

This is the fourth MOC-PS CME article on carpal tunnel syndrome. Each of the prior three has had a slightly different focus, and the reader is invited to review all to generate a comprehensive view of the management of this common, and often controversial, topic. The operative goal-to release the transverse carpal ligament-is straightforward: diagnosis, cause, and technique have generated more vibrant discussions.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — best-practice documentation advises that in the course of the examination and episode of care, clinicians should document results of the following questions, tests, and measures; upon completion of the clinical patient/client data, clinicians should differentiate CTS from other nerve injuries and then assess the CTS severity to determine if an immediate surgical referral is warranted. Patients may require electrodiagnostic studies when the clinical exam is inconclusive, and when assessing effectiveness of nonsurgical management, results should be documented again at discharge or at other follow-up point. Documentation of standard elements supports standardization for quality improvement in clinical care and research.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: treating hand pain and numbness [^8f799654]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain and a loss of feeling in your thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of your ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Guidelines published in the May 2019 issue of JOSPT make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2019;49(5):361. doi:10.2519/jospt.2019.0502.

Best available evidence — evidence hierarchy and scope indicate that when examining primary studies, the authors will analyze the best available evidence regardless of study design and will first consider randomized controlled trials identified by the search strategy; in the absence of two or more RCTs, they will sequentially search for prospective controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, and prospective case-series studies. For example, if there are two Level I studies that address the recommendation, Level III and IV studies are not included. They will only evaluate surrogate outcomes when no patient-oriented outcomes are available, did not include systematic reviews or meta-analyses compiled by others or guidelines developed by other organizations, and note that a 2022 literature search for all PICOs will be performed from last search date of 2017 CPG.

### The clinical practice guideline on carpal tunnel syndrome and workers' compensation [^ccf5605d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons has released an updated Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the evaluation and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In 2007, the initial CPG on CTS evaluated diagnosis and in 2008 and 2011, the CPG on CTS assessed treatment. The most recent CPG assesses both diagnosis and treatment in a generally non-controversial way. We assess the potential impact of this CPG on the care of workers compensation patients.

### Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^2b2a723c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline was created to improve patient care by outlining the appropriate information-gathering and decision-making processes involved in managing the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. The methods used to develop this clinical practice guideline were designed to combat bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. The guideline's recommendations are as follows: The physician should obtain an accurate patient history. The physician should perform a physical examination of the patient that may include personal characteristics as well as performing a sensory examination, manual muscle testing of the upper extremity, and provocative and/or discriminatory tests for alternative diagnoses. The physician may obtain electrodiagnostic tests to differentiate among diagnoses. This may be done in the presence of thenar atrophy and/or persistent numbness. The physician should obtain electrodiagnostic tests when clinical and/or provocative tests are positive and surgical management is being considered. If the physician orders electrodiagnostic tests, the testing protocol should follow the American Academy of Neurology/American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine/American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation guidelines for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. In addition, the physician should not routinely evaluate patients suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome with new technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and pressure-specified sensorimotor devices in the wrist and hand. This decision was based on an additional nonsystematic literature review following the face-to-face meeting of the work group.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: updated evidence and new questions [^812040f1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting quality of life for many people. Although it is a well recognised condition, new insights into epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have emerged in the past 6 years. The availability of disease-modifying treatments for rare systemic disorders associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (eg, amyloidosis) should alert clinicians to these diagnostic possibilities. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiology, the role of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool has been confirmed and new ultrasound techniques have been applied, the clinical use and feasibility of which require further investigation. Surgical and non-surgical interventions are beneficial for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and several treatment options are now available, giving clinicians the possibility to choose the best approach for every patient. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require further validation.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^f3e43460]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. The condition is responsible for substantial annual costs to society, both in terms of lost productivity and the costs of treatment. Accurate diagnostic criteria, the selection of treatment strategies based on high-level evidence, and outcomes data have been inconsistent despite the prevalence of the condition. The increased awareness of the need for evidence-based practice guidelines has, however, yielded important data to guide treatment of CTS. Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have been developed and should direct the treatment of CTS.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome… [^f80edbf0]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How is carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed clinically and how can the history and physical examination inform evidence-based management. Evidence Summary CTS is the most common entrapment neuropathy seen in primary care. It is caused by compression of the median nerve in the space underneath the wrist flexor retinaculum, which can produce pain in the wrist or lateral digits and thumb, paresthesia, and, in severe cases, sensory loss and weakness or atrophy of thenar muscles. History and physical examination elements, including provocative tests, have limited accuracy compared with electrodiagnostic testing for the diagnosis of CTS. The Phalen sign has a positive likelihood ratio of 1. 4 and a negative likelihood ratio of
0. 7, and the Tinel sign has an LR+ of 1. 3 and LR− of 0.
8. 1, 2 Hypalgesia in the median nerve distribution is minimally to moderately useful for ruling in CTS, with an LR+ of 3. 1, and weak thumb abduction has an LR+ of 1.
8.

1 A systematic review concluded that the Katz hand sensory symptom diagrams may be useful. 1 According to an evidence-based guideline from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery, there is strong evidence that no test alone can diagnose CTS, but the presence of thenar atrophy is useful for ruling in CTS. 3 The majority of studies that examined sensitivity and specificity of history and physical examination findings for CTS were performed in specialty settings, limiting the usefulness of these findings in primary care. However, one study found that 81% of patients referred by family physicians for clinically suspected CTS had the diagnosis confirmed by a neurologist.

### Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome by members of the American association for hand surgery [^36927397]. Hand (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy affecting the upper extremity, yet evidence-based guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment are lacking. We set out to expose any potential discrepancies in CTS practice attitudes based on surgeon's academic background, residency training, clinical experience, and other factors.

Methods

This was an online survey-based study. Members of the American Association for Hand Surgery (AAHS) were sent an electronic mail request (n = 817). The online questionnaire consisted of 12 questions that queried surgeons' approaches to the diagnosis as well as operative and non-operative management of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Results

One hundred twenty-three surgeons responded to the survey (15.1%). The locations of surgical practices varied within the United States and beyond. Most respondents were either orthopedic or plastic surgeons. With respect to practice duration, 15.4% had been in practice for 5 years or less, 30.9% of the respondents had been in practice between 6 and 15 years, 30.9% had been in practice between 16 and 25 years, and 26.8% had been in practice for more than 25 years. The most notable interspecialty differences were related to the use of operative antibiotics and the surgical approach. Plastic surgeons were less likely to recommend antibiotic use during surgery and more likely to utilize an open extensile approach during surgical release. Younger surgeons were more likely to employ a mini-open approach for carpal tunnel release.

Conclusions

We conclude that background training and generational differences contribute to the varied approaches observed in the diagnosis and management of CTS.

Diagnosis: MRI and upper limb neurodynamic testing in carpal tunnel syndrome — Moderate evidence suggests that MRI and Upper Limb Neurodynamic Testing should not be used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Evidence includes a randomized controlled trial showing poor specificity (47%) and moderate sensitivity (76%) for Neurodynamic testing compared to the reference standard of Electrodiagnostic testing, and based on available evidence outcomes show that neither test provides benefit in diagnosis compared to other more appropriate tools (CTS-6, Ultrasound, electrodiagnostics). Given the availability of alternative methods of diagnosis and the importance of appropriate diagnostic clarity for patients, the use of these tools for diagnosis is not recommended, and considering the associated costs of MRI and Neurodynamic testing they provide poor cost effectiveness in the standard work up. Overall acceptability is expected to be high as obtaining MRI and Neurodynamic testing is not common practice, and because of alternative diagnostic options, including exam alone (CTS-6), it is feasible to not utilize these tests in the evaluation of a patient for carpal tunnel syndrome.

Carpal tunnel syndrome clinical practice guidelines — Component 2: Evaluation — triage after examination states that a patient/client is appropriate for therapy and best evidence based intervention is provided when examination data show findings consistent with mild to moderate CTS and the patient/client agrees with a trial of nonsurgical management, or when examination data show findings consistent with severe CTS and (1) the patient/client has seen a surgeon who decided the individual is not a surgical candidate due to comorbidities; (2) the patient/client is awaiting surgery; or (3) the patient/client has refused surgery after counseling on the negative effects of long-standing nerve compression. The patient/client may benefit from referral to a physician when examination data suggest any severity of CTS with concurrent signs and symptoms of another condition that warrant further medical testing, with CTS treatment allowed if there are no contraindications, or when examination data suggest severe CTS and the patient/client chooses a trial of nonsurgical intervention while awaiting a physician visit. A patient is not appropriate for therapy and requires referral to a physician when examination data reveal a suspected neuromuscular diagnosis other than CTS that is beyond the scope of physical therapy treatment.

### Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome [^aab6c4a6]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

Fifty years after its widespread recognition, a significant minority of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome continue to experience poor outcomes from treatment. Much current treatment is supported by an inadequate or nonexistent evidence base. Surgical decompression, often considered the definitive solution, gives excellent results in only 75% of cases in ordinary practice and leaves 8% of patients worse than previously. The only other interventions that are clearly of benefit are neutral-angle wrist splinting, with a success rate of 37%, and steroids, which are better given by local injection than as oral treatment. The initial response rate to injection is 70% but there are frequent relapses. Nevertheless, these conservative treatments have a negligible incidence of serious complications and should be used more widely until surgical failures can be reduced to similar levels.

Carpal tunnel syndrome adjunctive testing — tenosynovial pathology for amyloidosis: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that, when multiple risk factors for amyloidosis are present, pathological analysis of tenosynovium may be performed, with Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. Rationale notes that carpal tunnel is often one of the earliest clinical manifestations of amyloidosis and that a recent cross-sectional study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel release showed that 10.2% exhibited amyloid deposits on tenosynovial biopsy, leading 4% to disease-modifying treatment. The benefits of tenosynovial analysis include the possible detection and possible treatment of amyloidosis, while harms include the downstream care cascade that may result from a positive biopsy (e.g., lab testing, echocardiograms) that may be negative. Cost considerations state there are costs associated and resources utilized in the pathological analysis of tenosynovium and downstream care cascades that may result from a positive sampling; acceptability is described as accepted practice but may vary based upon risk factors and patient preference; feasibility notes no feasibility issues beyond limitations in access to appropriate labs; and it is the opinion of the workgroup that this decision should be guided by patient preference and risk factors, with future research to involve cost effectiveness and the impact of downstream care cascades that may result from a positive sample.

### Utilization of diagnostic testing for carpal tunnel syndrome: a survey of the American society for surgery of the hand [^c1a82c30]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In 2016, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) changed the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, relaxing the recommendation for electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) prior to offering surgery. However, it is unknown how the updated guidelines changed the practice patterns of hand surgeons.

Methods

A web-based multiple-choice survey was sent to the members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. We assessed the current diagnostic practice patterns of hand surgeons. The survey was pretested using expert review with content and survey methodology experts and cognitively tested to ensure readability and understandability.

Results

The final cohort consisted of 770 hand surgeons. Approximately 26% of respondents required EDS prior to seeing a patient in consultation, and 56% of members routinely ordered EDS after evaluating a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome if testing was not performed prior to evaluation. The top reasons for obtaining EDS were to provide additional information for unclear diagnoses (97% selected), for patients with worker's compensation (82% selected), for grading the severity (73% selected), and to provide a baseline examination in the event of persistent symptoms (72% selected). However, only 38% of respondents believed that the current AAOS CPGs were appropriate, and 43% of respondents did not know what the guidelines recommended.

Conclusions

Despite the change in AAOS CPGs, EDS continues to be ubiquitously used for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of hand surgeons are unaware of the recommendations for EDS within the AAOS CPGs.

Clinical Relevance

These findings highlight the importance of explicitly defining which patients and which clinical scenarios would benefit from additional diagnostic testing and identifying strategies for more widespread dissemination of guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy [^002d1609]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) represents a constellation of symptoms that can occur as a result of compression of the median nerve as it traverses through a constrained space at the level of the wrist. It is the most common compressive mononeuropathy in the human body. Patients frequently present with similar history and physical examination findings, most commonly consisting of numbness of the hand that is worse at nighttime. Although CTS is one of the more common conditions seen by hand, orthopedic, or plastic surgeons, patients often first report symptoms to their primary or obstetric care clinician. In this review, we describe the pathophysiology of CTS in pregnant patients, summarize the best methods for diagnosing this condition, and review the recommended treatment options. This review provides a practical strategy that can be used by both primary care and obstetric care clinicians in diagnosing and treating pregnant patients with CTS.

### Clinical quality measures for intraoperative and perioperative management in carpal tunnel surgery [^f66a42d7]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Quality measure development follows a three-step process: (1) creating draft measures by integrating guidelines and literature, (2) refining and selecting final measures, and (3) testing the measures against a data source. Here, we report on the first two steps and the results of early pilot testing. This was one aspect of an effort to develop quality measures for carpal tunnel syndrome; other measures have been reported separately.

Developing Draft Measures

Developing draft measures was an iterative process involving collaboration among two hand surgeons, one general surgeon with experience developing measures of surgical quality, and two internists with expertise in quality measurement. First, we conducted a general literature search on carpal tunnel syndrome, searched MEDLINE, National Guidelines Clearinghouse, specialty society websites, and other sources of publicly available guidelines, and accessed personal reference collections. Team hand surgeons reviewed the guidelines and literature, chose key intraoperative and perioperative care processes that are likely to affect patient outcomes or that are widely recommended, then wrote draft measures.

Directed MEDLINE searches were conducted to identify evidence pertinent to the draft measures (search terms: surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome OR median neuropathy, additional MeSH terms used: surgical procedures, operative). For 845 citations identified, hand surgeons sequentially reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles to assess relevance to each draft measure. Draft measures were then refined, added, and deleted.

Next, the hand surgeons summarized, for each draft measure, the evidence supporting the relationship between the care process and patient outcomes, emphasizing the highest quality evidence identified. Given most evidence was not high quality, they used a simplified classification scheme: level 1, randomized controlled trial; 2, observational study; and 3, case series and expert opinion. Where level 1 evidence was not available, the summary described a chain of evidence or clinical rationale, including recommendations from recent guidelines.

### Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome [^5f85ac5d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

In September 2008, the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons approved a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. This guideline was subsequently endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The guideline makes nine specific recommendations: A course of nonsurgical treatment is an option in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Early surgery is an option with clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or when the patient so elects. Another nonsurgical treatment or surgery is suggested when the current treatment fails to resolve symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Sufficient evidence is not available to provide specific treatment recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome associated with such conditions as diabetes mellitus and coexistent cervical radiculopathy. Local steroid injection or splinting is suggested before considering surgery. Oral steroids or ultrasound are options. Carpal tunnel release is recommended as treatment. Heat therapy is not among the options to be used. Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome by complete division of the flexor retinaculum is recommended. Routine use of skin nerve preservation and epineurotomy is not suggested when carpal tunnel release is performed. Prescribing preoperative antibiotics for carpal tunnel surgery is an option. It is suggested that the wrist not be immobilized postoperatively after routine carpal tunnel surgery. It is suggested that instruments such as the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire be used to assess patient responses to carpal tunnel syndrome treatment for research.

### A 15-year review of clinical practice patterns in carpal tunnel syndrome based on continuous certification by the American board of plastic surgery [^4b587e12]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Board of Plastic Surgery has been collecting practice data on carpal tunnel syndrome treatment since 2004 as part of its Continuous Certification Program. These data allow plastic surgeons to compare their surgical experience to national trends and analyze those trends in relation to current evidence-based medicine.

Methods

Data on carpal tunnel syndrome treatment from 2004 to 2014 were compared to those from 2015 to 2020. National practice trends observed in these data were evaluated relative to current literature regarding evidence-based practices.

Results

A total of 11,090 carpal tunnel syndrome cases were included from 2004 to 2020. Electrodiagnostic and imaging studies were performed on most patients despite adding little sensitivity and specificity when physical examination tests are performed and not being considered cost-effective. An open "mini" approach has remained the most common surgical technique in carpal tunnel release for the last 15 years, with growing usage (53 percent versus 59 percent, p < 0.001). Splinting has decreased significantly over the last 15 years, from usage in 39 percent of patients to 28 percent (p < 0.001). Formal postoperative hand therapy has declined from 27 percent of patients to 22 percent (p < 0.001). Despite their low efficacy, 63 percent of patients received one or more perioperative doses of antibiotics.

Conclusions

Analysis of the Continuous Certification Program tracer data from the American Board of Plastic Surgery provides an excellent overview of current practice and its development over the 15 years since its inception. This analysis provides insight into how effectively plastic surgeons have remained aligned with developments in best practices in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Clinical quality measures for intraoperative and perioperative management in carpal tunnel surgery [^1c850eb6]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have developed nine measures that can be used to assess the quality of the intraoperative care provided to patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery, as well as 11 measures pertaining to pre- and postoperative care. A multidisciplinary panel of national experts in carpal tunnel syndrome, including several hand surgeons and orthopedists, rated these measures as valid reflections of quality and feasible for use with medical record review.

The preoperative measures are generally intended to ensure that surgeons are able to make an accurate diagnosis and adequately assess the potential risks and benefits of carpal tunnel surgery. Because an incorrect diagnosis is a common reason that patients do not improve after carpal tunnel surgery, these preoperative measures are likely to reduce unnecessary and inappropriate operations. In contrast, the intraoperative measures are designed to reduce the risks of serious surgical complications and persistent CTS symptoms. Damage to the median nerve (or its palmar cutaneous branch) is a particularly severe and disabling complication that several measures (#1, 3, 4, and 6–9) are designed to prevent. The remaining intraoperative measures (#2 and 5) are intended to reduce the chance that symptoms will not improve after surgery, also a fairly common occurrence. Several of the postoperative measures assess whether providers identify and respond to these types of problems appropriately.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: diagnosis and management [^e74a7d3a]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with the condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and radial half of the ring finger. Additional clues include positive physical examination findings, such as the flick sign, Phalen maneuver, and median nerve compression test. Although patients with typical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome do not need additional testing, ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and rule out other causes. If surgical decompression is planned, electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained to determine severity and surgical prognosis. Conservative treatment may be offered initially to patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Options include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B6 are not effective therapies. Local corticosteroid injection can provide relief for more than one month and delay the need for surgery at one year. Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome or whose symptoms have not improved after four to six months of conservative therapy should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective, but patients return to work an average of one week earlier with endoscopic repair.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^6741779b]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — nonsurgical management monitoring and baseline assessment: Clinicians should assess symptom duration, severity of nighttime symptoms, presence of a positive Phalen test, presence of thenar eminence muscle wasting, and prior nonsurgical interventions in individuals with CTS because these factors have been shown to influence results with nonsurgical management. In light of a preponderance of studies reporting fairly high rates of progression to surgery, clinicians must measure progress carefully and refer patients for surgical consultation if improvement with nonsurgical management is not observed.

### Clinical quality measures for intraoperative and perioperative management in carpal tunnel surgery [^57b6c4e3]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

For the purposes of improving care, quality measures are most useful when they address basic standards of care that have not already been widely implemented. We suspect that baseline rates of adherence will be higher for some of these measures than for others. For example, because Medicare and other payers require histories and physical examinations to include specific elements, we suspect that the stipulations of measure #11 will usually be met. In contrast, we expect that the incision location and release of the transverse carpal ligament (measures #3 and 4) may not be documented consistently. Future research will be needed to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

These measures also have other limitations. As noted, not all important aspects of care for patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery are amenable to direct measurement. Further, unique clinical circumstances can warrant exceptions to a measure. Justifiable exceptions are not problematic so long as they are rare and randomly distributed among populations of patients. The literature examining these practices is rather limited, and most of the measures are based on expert consensus. In contrast to some fields, such as cardiology, both musculoskeletal disorders and surgical care suffer for a lack of large, high-quality randomized controlled trials. Trials are not possible for all important care processes, however. For example, it would be unethical to randomly assign an incision location that can damage to the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. The panel method we used offers a rigorous and ethically acceptable approach to determining the right care in such clinical situations.

In conclusion, this project has developed a set of measures that can be used to evaluate the quality of the care provided to populations of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery. The several measures focusing on intra-operative care processes represent an important advance in the science of measuring quality of care. These measures will be useful in efforts to improve quality of care for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, whether initiated by providers, medical groups, payers, or policymakers. Intra-operative measures should be developed for other common operations.

### An analysis of surgeon experience, diagnostic testing, and treatment recommendation for carpal tunnel syndrome [^e4952bcd]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be made clinically using the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome-6 (CTS-6) criteria. The role of electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) is controversial. We examined differences in the utilization of CTS-6 and EDS based on surgeon experience and practice setting.

Methods

Members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand were emailed an anonymous web-based link to participate. The survey included an assessment of hypothetical CTS scenarios with varying clinical severity. We collected surgeon demographic attributes, years in practice, practice setting, and frequency of CTS-6 and EDS utilization. A comparison was made of years of experience with surgeon-reported utilization of CTS-6 and EDS as well as treatment recommendation.

Results

We received 771 responses (25% response rate). Surgeons recommended carpal tunnel release (CTR) for patients without EDS (16%), normal EDS (33%), and abnormal EDS (90%). Fifty-three percent of surgeons with < 15 years in practice reported often/always using CTS-6 criteria in their practice compared to 30% and 29% of surgeons with 16–30 years and > 30 years in practice, respectively. Surgeons with 16–30 and > 30 years in practice had significantly lower odds of reporting often/almost always using CTS-6 relative to surgeons with 1–15 years in practice (OR 0.35 and 0.31, respectively). A greater proportion of surgeons with 16–30 years (68%) and > 30 years (65.5%) in practice responded often/almost always applying EDS compared to surgeons with < 15 years (56%) in practice. In addition, surgeons with 16–30 years and > 30 years in practice had a higher odds of often/always using EDS (ORs 1.74 and 1.98, respectively) compared to surgeons with 1–15 years in practice (P < .05).

Conclusions

Utilization of CTS-6 and EDS varied based on years in practice. This difference may reflect changing guidelines, the growing evidence regarding clinical assessment tools, and the emergence of other diagnostic modalities.

Clinical Relevance

Given the expense and invasiveness of EDS, opportunities to integrate clinical assessment tools readily into the diagnostic algorithm may shift the role of EDS toward selective utilization for complex clinical scenarios rather than for routine use.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, and its risk of occurrence in the presence of repetitive, forceful angular hand movements, or vibration, is common. It is critical to make the diagnosis based on appropriate clinical history and findings and with corroborating electrodiagnostic studies. Conservative management should be undertaken with the goal of maintaining employment; surgical decompression can be highly effective, particularly if undertaken early on.

Surgical release technique — carpal tunnel syndrome: Strong evidence suggests that there is no difference in patient reported outcomes between a mini-open carpal tunnel release and an endoscopic carpal tunnel release, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Multiple identified studies consistently demonstrated no difference in long-term outcomes between the techniques. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release may afford a shorter return to work; however this may depend upon postoperative protocols, patient occupation, and other factors, and it can be associated with greater costs, which may affect patient preference; recent literature notes that complication rates for endoscopic carpal tunnel release may be higher than previously described in this review, and should be considered. Mini-open and endoscopic release are both accepted surgical techniques for carpal tunnel release. Both techniques are feasible, however each technique should be performed only by those who are trained in each technique. Prior studies evaluating cost effectiveness have favored mini-open carpal tunnel release when completed in the office setting, while advances in endoscopic release in the office may need to be considered.

Making the correct carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis is the most important step in treatment. Electrodiagnosis can confirm carpal tunnel syndrome and eliminate mimicking diseases from the differential. Treatment should provide satisfactory pain relief and protection of the median nerve from further deterioration. Electrodiagnosis testing provides information on focal median mononeuropathy at the wrist that could be used to classify carpal tunnel syndrome from mild to severe. The information obtained can help patients to understand and choose treatment in a patient-centered fashion. False positives can cause more harm than false negatives in the case of carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Comparing diagnostic and treatment recommendations of carpal tunnel syndrome available on the internet with AAOS clinical practice guidelines [^f2e677a0]. Hand (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common diagnoses in a hand surgeon's office, with estimated cost exceeding US $2 billion annually in the United States. Due to this prevalence and cost, patients often turn to the Internet for their medical care. It has been estimated that 72% of Internet users have looked online for health information in the last year. There is concern that patients may be getting misinformation with their Internet medical searches. Methods: An informal survey of the Internet was conducted to evaluate the content available to the public on the Internet and social media platforms regarding the diagnosis and treatment of CTS. The top 20 listings of 3 major search engines and information within 3 major social media sites were included. Results: Information gleaned from the search showed that while most listings were helpful in providing accurate diagnostic information and appropriate treatment modalities, there was also a great number of treatment modalities mentioned that may not be recommended by the treating physician. The guidelines established by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons both in 2007 and in 2008 and more recently in 2016 were used as a general reference but not directly compared with the informal Internet search for statistical analysis. Conclusions: This search outlines the importance of the information readily available to patients and how this may potentially alter patients' expectations prior to their arrival in the office.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome… [^e784f7fd]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients who may have carpal tunnel syndrome. This article reviews the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of this relatively common condition. Diagnosis One systematic review 7 evaluated the effectiveness of findings from the history and physical examination in predicting positive nerve conduction studies. The most highly predictive findings were symptom location, hypalgesia, and weak thumb abduction. The principal clinical tests for carpal tunnel syndrome are Phalen's maneuver and Tinel's sign. Phalen's maneuver is positive when flexing the wrist to 90 degrees for one minute elicits symptoms in the median nerve distribution. Tinel's sign is positive when tapping over the carpal tunnel elicits symptoms in the distribution of the median nerve.

Sensory findings in carpal tunnel syndrome also may be elicited by two-point discrimination, vibration, and monofilament testing. Orally administered corticosteroids have been shown to be more effective than NSAIDs or diuretics in the short-term treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The optimal corticosteroid dosage remains to be determined. In one prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, global symptom scores for carpal tunnel syndrome were significantly improved at two weeks and four weeks in patients randomized to receive prednisolone in a dosage of 20 mg per day for two weeks, followed by 10 mg per day for two weeks. LOCAL INJECTION Combined injection of a corticosteroid and a local anesthetic into or proximal to the carpal tunnel can be used in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Such injections can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic.

While most studies evaluating local injection have been retrospective or uncontrolled, two recent systematic reviews of RCTs concluded that local corticosteroid injection provides greater clinical improvement at one month compared with placebo. ULTRASOUND THERAPY Ultrasound therapy may be beneficial in the longer term management of carpal tunnel syndrome. A double-blind, randomized trial 28 found that compared with "sham ultrasound" treatment, 20 sessions of carpal tunnel ultrasound therapy administered over approximately seven weeks resulted in significantly greater improvement of symptoms at two weeks, seven weeks, and six months. However, a smaller study showed no benefit for this treatment. 29 More studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of ultrasound therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome.

Corticosteroid injection (CSI) for carpal tunnel syndrome — AAOS/ASSH guideline: Strong evidence suggests corticosteroid injection does not provide long-term improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Supporting data note that Three high quality studies with follow up ranging from 6 months to 5 years demonstrated no benefits; a study comparing CSI to nighttime immobilization found no significant differences at 1–2 years and an additional study comparing CSI to prolotherapy also showed no difference at 1 year, and taken together, there is strong evidence that, while there may be short-term improvement in symptoms with CSI, there is no long-term benefit. CSI may provide short term improvement in symptoms, and a therapeutic injection may cause localized pain and swelling, rare allergic reactions, and a small possibility of nerve damage. CSI are, individually, inexpensive interventions relative to many other treatments, and limited data address cost-effectiveness; we expect this recommendation to be generally accepted, however, CSI for short term relief of symptoms may continue, and minimizing use of CSI for any long-term benefit is readily available and feasible. CSI are very common and popular interventions with high utilization in clinical practice, and future investigation can focus on assessing the short-term benefits to patients, in relation to the cost, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and value of CSI, given the lack of long-term effectiveness.
