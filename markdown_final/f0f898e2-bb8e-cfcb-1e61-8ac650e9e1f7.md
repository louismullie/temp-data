## Question

Which of these refers to an alcoholic drink laced with a knockout drug?

Answer Choices:
A. Zombie
B. Kamikaze
C. Mickey Finn
D. Molotov cocktail

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option refers to an alcoholic drink laced with a knockout drug. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the phrase "knockout drug" and what that implies pharmacologically and colloquially. Then, I should verify the historical and common usage of each answer choice. Next, I will check whether any of the provided documents explicitly define or mention these terms. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the best answer, noting any ambiguities or corrections needed along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. A "knockout drug" in this context typically means a sedative or incapacitating agent slipped into a drink to render someone unconscious or severely impaired, historically chloral hydrate or similar sedatives, and the act is often called "slipping a mickey" in colloquial English, which points toward the phrase "Mickey Finn" as the correct answer [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify each option against that definition. "Zombie" can refer to a cocktail, but it is a rum-based drink and not associated with being drugged. "Kamikaze" is a vodka-based shooter and likewise not linked to surreptitious drugging. "Molotov cocktail" is an incendiary device, not a beverage at all, so that is clearly off-target. By contrast, "Mickey Finn" is the idiom specifically tied to spiking a drink with a sedative to incapacitate someone, which matches the question precisely [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should double-check whether any of the supplied references explicitly mention "Mickey Finn". I need to check the documents carefully. On review, none of the provided sources define or discuss these cocktail names, so I must rely on general knowledge of English usage and etymology. Given that, the most defensible choice remains "Mickey Finn" based on its established colloquial meaning, even though the packet does not contain a direct citation for it [^notfound].

> I should confirm the final selection and state it plainly. The correct answer is C. Mickey Finn, because it is the term historically and commonly used for an alcoholic drink secretly laced with a sedative or knockout drug, whereas the other options either denote ordinary cocktails or a non-beverage incendiary device [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. Mickey Finn**. A Mickey Finn is a slang term for an alcoholic drink secretly laced with a sedative or knockout drug, typically to incapacitate the drinker. The other options are incorrect: a zombie is a rum cocktail, a kamikaze is a vodka shooter, and a Molotov cocktail is an incendiary weapon, not a drink.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. Zombie

A zombie is a **rum-based cocktail** containing multiple types of rum, fruit juices, and liqueurs. It is known for its high alcohol content and fruity flavor, but it does not involve any knockout drugs. The term "zombie" refers to the drink's potent effect, not to incapacitation by drugs.

---

### B. Kamikaze

A kamikaze is a **vodka-based shooter** typically made with vodka, triple sec, and lime juice. It is a popular party drink known for its strong, tart flavor. Like the zombie, it does not involve any knockout drugs or sedatives.

---

### C. Mickey Finn

A Mickey Finn is a **slang term** for an alcoholic drink secretly laced with a sedative or knockout drug, such as chloral hydrate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The term originated in the late 19th or early 20th century and is commonly used to describe a drink used to incapacitate someone, often for malicious purposes such as robbery or assault.

---

### D. Molotov cocktail

A Molotov cocktail is an **incendiary weapon** consisting of a glass bottle filled with flammable liquid, typically gasoline, and a cloth wick. It is not a drink and has no association with alcoholic beverages or knockout drugs.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Mickey Finn**, as it specifically refers to an alcoholic drink laced with a knockout drug. The other options are incorrect because they either refer to regular alcoholic beverages (zombie, kamikaze) or an incendiary weapon (Molotov cocktail).

### The trouble with drink: why ideas matter [^d66ded2c]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

This paper builds upon the work of previous authors who have explored the evolution of ideas in the alcohol arena. With revisions in the relevant sections of ICD and DSM forthcoming, such matters are of considerable contemporary importance. The focus here will be upon the history of the last 200 years. The main themes to be explored include the flux of ideas on what, over time, has counted as the trouble with drink, ideas on the cause of the problem and the impact of this thinking on public action. Medical authorities of the late Enlightenment period made the revolutionary suggestion that habitual drunkenness constituted a disease, rather than a vice. The thread of that idea can be traced to the present day, but with an alternative perception of drink itself or alcohol-related problems generally, as cause for concern, also having a lineage. There are several inferences to be drawn from this history: the need for vigilance lest disease formulations become stalking-horses for moralism and social control, the need to integrate awareness of alcohol dependence as a dimensional individual-level problem, with a public health understanding of the vastly amorphous and at least equally important universe of alcohol-related problems; the dangers lurking in scientific reductionism when the problems at issue truly require a multi-disciplinary analysis; and the need for global consensus rather than cultural imposition of ideas on what counts as the problem with drink.

### Is there a safe limit for consumption of alcohol? [^b6e1af50]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In order to understand and curb the harms related to alcohol, it will be necessary to think beyond patterns of use that meet criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or addiction. Current research suggests that regular daily alcohol use does not confer a health benefit, and, for many persons, even relatively low consumption is associated with a health risk. Determining a safe limit for alcohol consumption is challenging both for the individual person and for society. We conclude that excessive drinking is always risky. We provide a list of circumstances, such as chronic illness, driving a vehicle, or pregnancy where persons should be advised to abstain from alcohol. We recognise the need to encourage less consumption of alcohol, particularly in young adults and older adults with co-morbid conditions (especially if taking multiple medications). Finally, we offer the modest proposal that, for persons without the contributing negative influences described above, consumption which adheres to one drink per session, with interspersed abstinent days, does not constitute a meaningful risk to health.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^2a64334b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal management — key definitions and thresholds are outlined to support clinical use. Supportive care is treatment to "prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and to improve the patient's comfort, quality of life and safety" and can include "reassurance, orientation, general nursing care, and adherence to safety measures and protocols." The therapeutic window is the "range of drug dose amount needed to maintain therapeutic effect yet avoid adverse events" and is considered when adjusting doses due to patient variability and exposure to other substances. A treatment plan is a therapeutic strategy that may incorporate patient education, drug therapy, and participation of health professionals. Unhealthy alcohol use includes binge drinking defined as "consuming 4 or more alcoholic beverages per occasion for women or 5 or more drinks per occasion for men" and heavy drinking defined as "consuming 8 or more alcoholic beverages per week for women or 15 or more alcoholic beverages per week for men." Withdrawal management refers to the medical and psychological care of patients experiencing withdrawal after ceasing or reducing alcohol use and includes attenuation of withdrawal features and interrupting habitual compulsive use in persons with substance use disorder (SUD).

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder? [^057074e0]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

COMMON GROUND

Is there a middle ground between these two views of alcohol dependence that may be appreciated when one considers the component terms — chronic, relapsing and disorder? For many people who experience alcohol dependence, there is indeed chronicity in the sense that this is not just a short-lived episode responsive to some sort of quick fix. Alcohol dependence usually takes many years to develop and be maintained before it is subsequently overcome by most people on their own. Drinking behaviour is dynamic and modified by a multitude of influences at different levels of intervention among those who are alcohol-dependent. Difficulties in controlling consumption are characteristic of many of those who have dependence and are fundamental to our understanding of it, and great suffering is involved in their personal struggles to limit the associated harms. Relapse in the sense of setbacks in these struggles is not at all unusual. Finally, alcohol dependence is clearly a disorder in diagnostic terms and disordered in the sense that it conflicts with deeply held values and goals and does damage to them.

It is not difficult to see why viewing alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder has appeal, as the formulation attests to important aspects of the phenomenon. Therein lies its limitation, as it does not capture accurately the apparent experience of most people affected by alcohol dependence, and thus potentially obscures rather than illuminates the full range of problems of dependence. It is almost as though the term 'chronic relapsing disorder' takes on a life of its own, holding more meaning than when its constituent terms are used in isolation. When applied by leaders of the field in non-specialist addiction journals, it is used to communicate the essential nature of dependence. Finer-grained attention to the long-term course of the behaviour in the general population as observed in epidemiological studies provides a dramatically different and more heterogeneous picture from that attained in biologically orientated clinical research studies in treatment populations. This disjoint between the understanding of what is alcohol dependence in clinical and general population settings is at the root of our concern with adopting the model of a chronic relapsing disorder for alcohol dependence.

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder? [^87a9820f]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

For public health

The danger of conceptualizing alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder is that it directs attention to a subgroup of those with severe dependence, and thus potentially undermines public health strategic responses for both those with dependence and those whose drinking is harmful or hazardous rather than dependent. A consideration of the entire continuum of alcohol problems (including both those at risk of problems and those with alcohol dependence) is the necessary context for a population perspective on alcohol control, not least because population-level interventions are an important source of benefit for dependent drinkers as well as for other at-risk drinkers. Further, it is this larger population of at-risk drinkers who cause the majority of costs to society that result from alcohol consumption, simply because of their numbers (referred to as the prevention paradox;). The best evidence regarding ways to reduce the prevalence of alcohol problems in our society rests almost entirely with public health initiatives (such as reducing availability, taxation, drinking and driving legislation and the provision of brief interventions;). Any model of alcohol dependence that takes us away from this recognition of the primary importance of public health interventions in the prevention and management of alcohol problems in the general population may thus impair our ability to effectively address these significant societal concerns.

### A safe level of alcohol consumption: the right answer demands the right question [^c7d37f8a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcohol has been produced by humans for nearly ten millennia, but gold-standard evidence by which to judge the health effects of limited alcohol consumption remains elusive, introducing serious difficulty in considering the safety of alcohol consumption. To do so, physicians and policymakers must consider the population, dose and context of alcohol consumption and the end-point, preferably a holistic composite, of interest. The limitations of new research trends, such as mega-cohorts, genetic instrumental variable analysis and modelling studies, must also be viewed against the much larger backdrop of existing evidence. Some existing guidelines, such as the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, succeed remarkably in this task. Nonetheless, large-scale randomized trials are urgently needed if future generations are to enjoy any greater insight into the health effects of population-wide alcohol consumption than the current one has.

Appendix C — Recovery and recurrence terminology advises using "Person in recovery," "Person in long-term recovery," and "Person who has maintained recovery" instead of "Former addict," "Former drug user," "Former alcoholic," or "Person who "stayed clean"" because it "Encompasses the recovery process of improved health versus the implication that the person was "dirty" before recovery." For return-to-use events, use "Return to use," "Experienced a recurrence," or "Resumed drinking or using drugs" instead of "Relapsed," "Slipped," or "Chronic relapser," as this "Advances language that is medically accurate and non- stigmatizing."

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder? [^ea999735]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

This 'For Debate' paper starts by recognizing the growing trend towards considering alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder. We argue that the adoption of this model results from focusing on those in treatment for alcohol dependence rather than considering the larger number of people in the general population who meet criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. The majority of the general population who ever experience alcohol dependence do not behave as though they have a chronic relapsing disorder: they do not seek treatment, resolve their dependence themselves and do not relapse repeatedly. We suggest that caution is therefore needed in using the chronic relapsing disorder label. Our primary concerns are that this formulation privileges biological aspects of dependence to the detriment of psychological and social contributions, it inhibits much-needed developments in understanding alcohol dependence and leads to inefficient distributions of public health and clinical care resources for alcohol dependence. We invite debate on this issue.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^0f07531f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 criteria — alcohol use disorder describe a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended; there is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use; a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects; craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol; recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home; continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol; important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use; recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous; alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol; tolerance, as defined by either a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol; and withdrawal, as manifested by either the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol or alcohol (or closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Binge drinking [^bce3022c]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) definitions — standard drink and binge drinking — are described for clinical reference: The original definition of binge drinking (5 drinks in 2 hours) was based on size and body composition for men. A standard drink is defined as one that contains 14 g of pure alcohol (about 0.6 fluid oz or 1.2 tablespoons), as is found in one 12-oz beer; one 5-oz glass of wine, or one 1.5-oz shot of distilled spirits, and the NIAAA defines binge drinking as the pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08% or greater.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^e9b33d0d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — glossary core terms define abstinence, provider roles, therapy types, assessment dimensions, and substance use terminology as follows: Abstinence is the voluntary refraining from alcohol and other substances, and the use of FDA‑approved medication for substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence. Addiction specialist physicians include addiction medicine physicians and addiction psychiatrists. Adjunct therapy is a pharmaceutical drug used with a primary pharmaceutical to assist the primary treatment, whereas monotherapy is the use of a single drug to treat a disorder or disease. The ASAM Criteria uses six dimensions to define a holistic biopsychosocial assessment for service and treatment planning. Patients is intentionally broad and encompasses anyone who receives care for a substance use disorder in a specialty addiction treatment center or other healthcare setting. Pharmacotherapy is therapy using pharmaceutical drugs. Recovery capital refers to the breadth and depth of internal and external resources that can be drawn upon to initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems. Substance use refers to the use of psychotropic substances, which may include illegal drugs, medications or alcohol, and does not refer to nicotine. Substance use disorders are marked by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating continued use despite significant problems, with diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, and the term replaces what was included as substance dependence and substance abuse in the DSM-4.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^20fd13c0]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is the cause of an ongoing public health crisis, and accounts for ~5% of global disease burden. A minority of people with recreational alcohol use develop alcohol addiction (hereafter equated with "alcohol dependence" or simply "alcoholism"), a condition characterized by a systematically biased choice preference for alcohol at the expense of healthy rewards, and continued use despite adverse consequences ("compulsivity"). Alcoholism is arguably the most pressing area of unmet medical needs in psychiatry, with only a small fraction of patients receiving effective, evidence-based treatments. Medications currently approved for the treatment of alcoholism have small effect sizes, and their clinical uptake is negligible. No mechanistically new medications have been approved since 2004, and promising preclinical results have failed to translate into novel treatments. This has contributed to a reemerging debate whether and to what extent alcohol addiction represents a medical condition, or reflects maladaptive choices without an underlying brain pathology. Here, we review this landscape, and discuss the challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities to retool drug development in this important therapeutic area.

### Identification and treatment of alcohol use disorder [^649b1acb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol use disorder:

- **Definition**: AUD, according to DSM-5-TR, is characterized by a pattern of alcohol consumption that results in problems associated with ≥ 2 potential symptoms of tolerance, withdrawal, increased amount of alcohol consumed over time, difficulty in controlling drinking, neglect of activities, ineffective efforts to reduce use, craving, failure to fulfill major role obligations, recurrent alcohol use in hazardous situations, time spent drinking or recovering from alcohol, and drinking despite physical/psychological problems in the past year.
- **Pathophysiology**: AUD is caused due to genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: The neurobiological disturbances due to habitual drinking cause AUD, which increases the risk of damage to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, immune, nervous, and other systems. AUD causes increased morbidity and mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AUD is associated with increased mortality from all causes of death (mortality rate ratio, 3.0–5.2).

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnostic criteria and severity — Diagnosis is based on past-year symptoms, where the presence of at least 2 symptoms indicates an AUD and severity is graded by symptom count: Mild: 2–3 symptoms; Moderate: 4–5 symptoms; Severe: 6 or more symptoms. Criteria include statements such as "Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended," "There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use," "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol," and physiologic features including "Tolerance, as defined by either of the following" with "Need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol," and "Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following" with "The characteristic alcohol withdrawal syndrome; or Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms."

Epidemiology

There are difficulties in interpreting data relating to the health consequences of alcohol consumption. There is a lack of world‐wide consensus as to the amount of alcohol in a standard alcoholic drink. In the United States a 'standard drink' contains 14 g of pure alcohol, but a 'unit' of alcohol in the United Kingdom is classified as 8 g of pure alcohol, and a standard drink in other countries may contain as much as 20 g of alcohol 8. This review will adopt the US definition of a standard drink unless stated otherwise. Definitions of 'low', 'moderate' and 'hazardous' alcohol consumption have also varied, but most investigators have now settled on the following broad definition: low‐risk drinking = two or fewer drinks/day for men and one drink/day or less for women, moderate‐risk drinking = three to four drinks/day for men and two to three drinks/day for women, high‐risk drinking = five or more drinks/day for men and four or more drinks/day for women and binge drinking = five or more drinks/occasion for men and four or more drinks/occasion for women.

Other factors complicating epidemiological studies of alcohol consumption include lack of adequate control for confounding factors such as cigarette smoking, general health and socio‐economic status; problems with the accurate assessment of alcohol consumption (e.g. assessment over fewer than 30 days used to assess life‐time risk of morbidity and mortality and a failure to assess both quantity and frequency of consumption); counting both former drinkers and occasional drinkers as abstainers (which may make moderate drinkers seem healthier if ill health is the reason for abstention or occasional drinking); and combining occasional drinkers with moderate drinkers 9. In fact, Rehm has argued that methodological issues render the utility of cohort studies assessing the relationship between alcohol use and all‐cause mortality as 'almost meaningless' 10.

### Recommended terminology for substance use disorders in the care of children, adolescents, young adults, and families [^3d9417e1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Recommended terminology regarding persons — Person-first language is emphasized, with "Person with a substance use disorder" listed under "Say This" instead of stigmatizing labels such as "Substance/drug abuser, addict, junkie, druggie, stoner, alcoholic, drunk (and other colloquial substance-specific terms)," because "Uses person-first language, as individuals are not defined solely by their substance use. If unsure of whether the individual has a diagnosed disorder, then the description of 'a person who uses [insert specific substance]' is most appropriate." Accordingly, "Person who uses [insert specific substance: opioid, cocaine, alcohol, etc]" is preferred over "Drug user, heroin user, drinker, crackhead, pothead, drug-seeking (and other colloquial substance-specific terms)." When discussing care progress, "Treatment was not effective" and "Patient in need of more support/ higher level of treatment" are recommended rather than "Patient who failed treatment" or "Noncompliant, nonadherent," with the rationale "Referring to the treatment not meeting the needs of the patient or the patient needing a higher level of treatment, rather than the patient failing." For infants, use "Infant/baby with neonatal withdrawal syndrome," "Infant/baby born substance-exposed," or "Infant/baby with physiologic dependence/withdrawal" instead of "Addicted baby," "Born addicted," "Drug endangered," "Neonatal abstinence syndrome baby or NAS baby," or "Crack baby," because "Substance use disorders, characterized by repeated use despite harmful consequences, cannot be diagnosed in an infant; an infant can develop physiologic dependence to a substance such as opioids, for which the medical term is neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome or neonatal withdrawal."

### Screening and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^efbe3d33]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

WHO/ICD-10 alcohol dependence — diagnostic definition requires ≥ 3 of the following at some time during the previous year: a strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance; difficulties in controlling substance-taking behavior in terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use; a physiological withdrawal state evidenced by characteristic withdrawal syndrome or use of the same (or closely related) substance to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms; evidence of tolerance such that increased doses are required to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses; progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests because of psychoactive substance use or increased time to obtain, take, or recover from the substance; and persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of overtly harmful consequences, with efforts made to determine that the user was actually, or could be expected to be, aware of the nature and extent of the harm.

### Is' age at first drink' a useful concept in alcohol research and prevention? We doubt that [^c37a3df8]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To address and discuss the weaknesses of age at first drink (AFD) as a concept in alcohol research and prevention.

Methods

Narrative literature review.

Results

Varying from one sip to the consumption of several full drinks, and sometimes including the specification of particular conditions (e.g. without parental consent), no exact definition and operationalization of AFD was found. Evidence reveals poor test-retest reliability when the same individuals report their AFD two or more times. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence fail to explain why having one sip or one drink earlier than peers should cause heavier drinking and related problems later in life. Alternative explanations such as self-selection, third variable effects and systematic report bias are not considered in most studies. These shortcomings also make AFD unsuitable as an indicator or marker of underlying problems such as conduct problems and academic failure. Together with unjustified causal inferences, this has led to an over-emphasis on the relevance of postponing AFD as a way to prevent problems later in life.

Conclusion

We argue in favour of shifting the focus of alcohol research and prevention away from AFD towards a better understanding of the progression from infrequent, low-quantity drinking to more detrimental drinking patterns and the prevention of associated acute and short-term harm.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^09533706]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal terminology is defined to target the most harmful presentations: Complicated alcohol withdrawal is the development of alcohol withdrawal-related seizures or alcohol withdrawal delirium; severe alcohol withdrawal comprises severe but not complicated signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal; and complications of alcohol withdrawal are alcohol withdrawal signs and symptoms complicated by life-threatening comorbidities and/or risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal.

Additional individual risk factors and cumulative risk — Recommendation II.6 states that the following individual factors may increase a patient's risk for complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: concomitant use of other addictive substances, positive blood alcohol concentration in the presence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, and signs or symptoms of a co-occurring psychiatric disorder that are active and reflect a moderate level of severity. Recommendation II.7 adds that patients' risk for complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is increased by the presence of multiple risk factors.

Alcohol withdrawal — referral recommendations — state that if an individual appears intoxicated and/or a corrections-administered breathalyzer test suggests intoxication, the individual should be referred for immediate clinical assessment. Individuals reporting or known to be using alcohol recently, regularly, and heavily (eight or more standard drinks per day for men and six or more standard drinks per day for women, 4 or more days per week) should be referred for immediate clinical assessment and possible withdrawal management protocol. Individuals who report using any alcohol in the past week and also report a history of complicated withdrawal should be referred for immediate clinical assessment.

### Alcohol measurement methodology in epidemiology: recent advances and opportunities [^c15add48]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To review and discuss measurement issues in survey assessment of alcohol consumption for epidemiological studies.

Methods

The following areas are considered: implications of cognitive studies of question answering such as self-referenced schemata of drinking, reference period and retrospective recall, as well as the assets and liabilities of types of current (e.g. food frequency, quantity-frequency, graduated frequencies and heavy drinking indicators) and life-time drinking measures. Finally we consider units of measurement and improving measurement by detailing the ethanol content of drinks in natural settings.

Results and Conclusions

Cognitive studies suggest inherent limitations in the measurement enterprise, yet diary studies show promise of broadly validating methods that assess a range of drinking amounts per occasion; improvements in survey measures of drinking in the life course are indicated; attending in detail to on- and off-premise drink pour sizes and ethanol concentrations of various beverages shows promise of narrowing the coverage gap plaguing survey alcohol measurement.

### A 42-year-old man considering whether to drink alcohol for his health [^2453a0b8]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol consumption is widespread and, in excess, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, a consistent body of observational evidence has found that individuals who consume alcohol within recommended limits have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than do abstainers. These observations have led many to consider small amounts of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy. Mr Q, a 42-year-old man who has consistently sought ways to preserve his health, is at a crossroads in his discussions with his physicians about the health effects of his regular, limited alcohol intake. The discussion reviews the epidemiology of drinking in the United States, the established effects of moderate alcohol intake on key pathophysiological biomarkers and pathways, the strengths and limitations of observational evidence linking alcohol intake to lower risk of coronary heart disease, other chronic diseases linked to moderate alcohol intake, and a framework in which Mr Q can discuss the potential risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with his physicians.

### Helping patients who drink too much: an evidence-based guide for primary care clinicians [^7b385f72]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, but few heavy drinkers receive treatment. Primary care physicians are in a position to address heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders with patients, and can do so quickly and effectively. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has published a guide for physicians that offers an evidence-based approach to screening, assessing, and treating alcohol use disorders in general health care settings. Screening can be performed by asking patients how many heavy drinking days they have per week. Assessing patients' willingness to change their drinking behaviors can guide treatment. Treatment recommendations should be presented in a clear, nonjudgmental way. Patients who are not alcohol-dependent may opt to reduce drinking to lower risk levels. Patients with alcohol dependence should receive pharmacotherapy and brief behavioral support, as well as disease management for chronic relapsing dependence. All patients with alcohol dependence should be encouraged to participate in community support groups

### Alcohol abuse in adolescents [^9dd59fea]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol abuse by adolescents is widespread in the United Kingdom, has complex cultural, economic and biological origins and is associated with adverse health consequences. Affected young people present medically with intoxication or its immediate consequences such as injury or self-harm. A significant number also suffer adverse psychosocial effects and longer-term adverse outcomes. Even some younger patients are now presenting with evidence of physiological dependence. Interpretation of the literature and clinical experience suggests that practitioners have greater capacity to respond effectively than they may believe. Modest concerted effort could make the medical profession much more relevant to the needs of these, often troubled, young people.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^4deb5bb0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States." Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD." "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver." Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD," and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC."

### Managed alcohol as a harm reduction intervention for alcohol addiction in populations at high risk for substance abuse [^09df9ff3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Managed alcohol programmes (MAP) are a harm reduction strategy used to minimise the personal harm and adverse societal effects that alcohol dependence can lead to by providing an alternative to zero-tolerance approaches that incorporate drinking goals (abstinence or moderation) that are compatible with the needs of the individual, and promoting access to services by offering low-threshold alternatives. This enables clients to gain access to services despite continued alcohol consumption and works to help the patient understand the risks involved in their behaviour and make decisions about their own treatment goals.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of MAP treatment regimens (serving limited quantities of alcohol daily to alcoholics) on their own or as compared to moderate drinking (self-controlled drinking), screening and brief intervention using a harm reduction approach, traditional abstinence-based interventions (12 step programmes) and no intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to March 2012. This search was expanded by handsearching of high-yield journals and conference proceedings that had not already been handsearched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration, searching reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, references to ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the National Research Register and IFPMA Clinical Trials Database (which contains ClinicalTrials.gov, Centerwatch, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalStudyResults.gov, and Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Sperimentazione Clinica dei Medicinali). Trials registers, grey literature and reference lists were also searched. Individuals, organisations and experts in the field were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised control trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and control before and after (CBA) studies involving vulnerable people aged 18 years or older who were at high risk for alcohol abuse attending MAP, defined as a structured programme that provided clients with controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, comparing no treatment, moderate drinking, brief intervention or 12-step variants.

Data Collection and Analysis

All study citations were collated into a single database. Two review author independently screened titles and abstracts and selected references potentially relevant to the review. Differences between selection lists were resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded according to the eligibility criteria. In the event of a disagreement, a third author was consulted.

Main Results

No studies were included in the review. This systematic review was intended to assess the effectiveness of a brief MAP on the reduction of incidence of harmful behaviour; however, no evidence was available to make this comparison; 22 articles were considered possibly relevant and all were excluded. Most articles were excluded because they failed to compare or consider managed alcohol as the experimental or control intervention, as well as one study (Baker 2010), which was also excluded because study participants were under 18 years of age. No study reviewed offered an intervention that was compared with managed alcohol or considered it as the intervention of interest, providing insufficient evidence to address the objectives of the review. Four studies (Aalto 2001; Baker 2010; Bertholet 2005; Tracy 2007) considered alcohol reduction as an outcome of interest, while four engaged interventions in a shelter setting or targeted vulnerable people (Baker 2010; Bradford 2005; Lapham 1993; McGlynn 1993); only one study (Kidd 2011) offered a qualitative assessment of a participant being admitted to MAP, but offered no analysis of the programme itself. These results accurately reflect the use of MAPs in current practice as existing programmes are ongoing only in a small number of sample pilot projects that target individuals with severe alcohol dependence or who consume non-beverage alcohol.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of evidence does not allow for a conclusion regarding the efficacy of MAP on their own, or as compared to brief intervention, moderate drinking, no intervention or 12-step variants. It is the review authors' opinion that it is likely to be the objective of MAPs that reduce their reportability and use in current practice, rather than a failure to provide an intervention that reduces the effects of alcohol dependence. Aiming to reduce harmful or antisocial behaviour in vulnerable individuals through the regulation of daily alcohol intake, rather than reducing harmful alcohol intake over time, provides considerable difficulty in developing measures of success from self-reported data (low treatment thresholds), monitoring long-term efficacy or establishing causal links between programme admission and a reduction in targeted behaviours, owing to the fact that prolonged participation in the programme is likely to indicate a willingness in the individual to change their behaviour patterns. More effort is needed to develop reporting measures, as well as methodologies, which address these specific challenges.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^ded50db2]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

Secondary prevention

People with established cardiovascular disease show improved outcomes with a reduction to low‐volume drinking. A meta‐analysis of 16 351 patients with a previous diagnosis of CVD found a J‐shaped curve with maximal risk at two drinks/day 66. A similar relationship exists between alcohol and cardiovascular mortality in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction 67, and low levels of alcohol are also associated with less atherosclerotic progression in coronary artery bypass grafts post‐coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 68.

Mortality rates

The mortality risk may decline threefold if a person with a usual alcohol intake of 96 g ethanol/day cuts down to 36 g ethanol/day compared with a constant daily intake of 60 g ethanol/day 69. In one long‐term prospective cohort study (n = 850), 15% heavy drinking patients (defined as 50 g ethanol or more per drinking occasion or daily drinking) died after 10 years and 39.1% after 20 years, compared to low‐volume drinkers consuming less than 50 g ethanol per drinking occasion less than once per month (5.3% at 10 years and 19.7% at 20 years) 70. In contrast, significantly more relapsed patients (73%) died prematurely at the mean age of 48 years (mainly from heart attack or heart failure) compared to those without relapses (30%) in the 16‐year observation period.

Conclusions

Although low‐volume alcohol consumption (one drink/day or less for women and two drinks for men) may confer some benefit in terms of reduced risk of ischaemic heart disease 71, alcohol use at higher levels is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and premature mortality. Occasional binge drinking (more than five drinks within a few hours, with intoxication as intended consequence) reverses any protection associated with low‐volume alcohol consumption. The main cardiovascular effects of long‐term alcohol consumption are hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Treatment for alcohol use disorder is best focused on abstinence from alcohol, although gains are often achieved by significant reduction in alcohol consumption or changes in pattern of drinking.

### Detecting alcoholism. the CAGE questionnaire [^3f587312]. JAMA (1984). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "CAGE questionnaire for alcohol use" for alcohol use disorder.

The CAGE questionnaire is a brief, self-report screening tool used to identify potential problems with alcohol. The acronym CAGE stands for the four questions in the questionnaire: Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener.

This calculator is applicable to the general adult population, particularly those suspected of having alcohol use disorders. It is often used in primary care settings, emergency departments, and other healthcare settings where alcohol use may be a concern.

The clinical utility of the CAGE questionnaire is to screen for excessive or problematic alcohol use. It is not a diagnostic tool, but rather a preliminary method to identify individuals who may need further assessment or intervention for alcohol-related problems.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the CAGE questionnaire. However, it should be noted that this tool may not be as effective in identifying less severe alcohol problems or alcohol abuse in certain populations, such as women and younger adults. It is also not designed to identify drug use disorders.

The CAGE questionnaire helps identify potential alcohol dependency through four introspective yes-or-no questions regarding the individual's drinking habits and their effects:

1. Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
2. Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
3. Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?
4. Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?

Each "Yes" response scores 1 point, and each "No" scores 0. The responses are scored as follows:

| **Question** | **Response** | **Score** |
|-|-|-|
| Felt you should cut down on your drinking? | Yes | 1 |
| Annoyed by people's criticism of your drinking? | Yes | 1 |
| Felt guilty about your drinking? | Yes | 1 |
| Had a drink in the morning to steady nerves or cure a hangover? | Yes | 1 |
| Any "No" response | No | 0 |

The total score, ranging from 0 to 4, determines the interpretation:

- A score of 0 or 1 suggests alcoholism is unlikely. This indicates few concerns or external feedback impacting their perception of drinking habits.
- A score of 2 or more suggests alcoholism is likely, highlighting areas of concern where the individual acknowledges potential issues through affirmations of criticism, guilt, or habitual drinking behaviors.

This simple yet effective approach allows for a swift evaluation of alcohol use concerns for both individuals and health professionals.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Disulfiram is an aid in the management of selected chronic alcohol patients who want to remain in a state of enforced sobriety so that supportive and psychotherapeutic treatment may be applied to best advantage.

Disulfiram is not a cure for alcoholism. When used alone, without proper motivation and supportive therapy, it is unlikely that it will have any substantive effect on the drinking pattern of the chronic alcoholic.

- **Definition**: ALD encompasses a spectrum of disorders that may take an acute form (alcoholic hepatitis) or present as a chronic disease (steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis).
- **Pathophysiology**: ALD is caused by heavy alcohol use.
- **Disease course**: Alcohol abuse results in steatosis followed by steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis due to inflammation, hepatocellular damage, and liver fibrosis. Disease progression may also cause liver decompensation and HCC.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality of ALD as a single group is around 20%.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^38f3a993]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Alcohol and fertility — Evidence is mixed for women, with a cohort study of 7,393 women showing risk of infertility increased among those consuming two alcoholic drinks per day (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.09–2.31) and decreased in those consuming less than one drink per day (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.90); higher intake of more than two drinks per day (one drink containing 10 g of ethanol) probably is best avoided when attempting pregnancy, though there is limited evidence that moderate alcohol consumption adversely affects fertility, and alcohol consumption should cease altogether during pregnancy because no "safe" level has been established; in men, chronic dependence is associated with adverse semen and hormonal markers but a dose–response pattern has not been established and there is a lack of evidence for any effect of moderate alcohol consumption on male fertility.

A cross-sectional study investigating associations between alcohol drinking motives and alcohol-free and low-alcohol drink consumption among adults in great britain [^d25f3c9e]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Analysis

Data preparation and analyses were undertaken in R V.4.3.1. The following groups of respondents were removed:

Respondents who answered inconsistently regarding their no/lo consumption (ie, responding that they engaged in situation-specific no/lo consumption: hybrid, on-trade or off-trade more often than they reported consuming no/lo drinks overall, n = 163). This follows good practice advice for data cleaningand aligns with practice used in other studies reporting on this data.
Respondents who reported that they did not know whether they drank alcohol for any of the drinking motives (n = 189). While a debate exists as to whether 'don't know' responses should be treated as missing, or identified as a substantive response, for our research we chose to exclude these participants. Individuals providing a 'don't know' response for the drinking motives did not differ from the rest of the sample on key demographic variables (age, sex, social grade, education level, alcohol consumption, no/lo consumption).
Respondents describing their gender in another way (n = 13). This final group was removed due to their small number, meaning it was not possible to meaningfully include them in the analysis.

Complete data were available for 2118 of 2555 respondents (82.9%). A flow chart illustrating participant eligibility and missing data is presented in online supplemental figure 1. The following variables had missing data: gender, n = 6; social grade, n = 106, IMD, n = 358. Little's missing completely at random (MCAR) test was significant, indicating it was not appropriate to treat data as MCAR. By investigating patterns of missing data, there was no evidence of systematic missingness; therefore, we felt it was appropriate to assume the data was missing at random and proceeded with multiple imputation, using the mice package in R.18 datasets were imputed. Trace plots of the means and SD of the imputed values for the variables with missing data (IMD, social grade, sex) indicated that the imputation chains converged well. The primary analyses present pooled results from the imputed datasets which were then population weighted. The impact of survey weighting was evaluated (online supplemental table 1). It appeared to effectively adjust the sample to better represent the target population without unduly distorting key variable means.

### A lethal cocktail-shining a light on the relationship between alcohol use and pesticide self-poisoning [^1aa364d1]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol and pesticides are toxic substances that each cause acute and chronic harm to humans. Alcohol plays an important and complex role in pesticide self-poisoning, involving toxicological, public health, and social aspects important for research, prevention, and interventions.

Alcohol Use Disorder and Social Harms

While the evidence on alcohol co-ingestion in the context of pesticide self-poisoning is limited, it appears that alcohol use increases complications. Even fewer studies address alcohol use disorder and dependence among pesticide self-poisoning patients. The harmful use of alcohol also impacts social life, families, and communities in several ways, including pesticide self-poisoning among individuals around the alcohol user. This, however, is vastly understudied.

Outside Influences

Agrochemicals and alcohol are produced by industries with financial interests, and the outcome of individual acts of pesticide self-poisoning depends on the lethality of the pesticide purchased and ingested. The promotion of acutely toxic pesticides by companies must be acknowledged within this issue.

Conclusion

The relationship between alcohol and pesticide self-poisoning is increasingly clear, but more studies are needed to guide management. We cannot ignore that pesticide self-poisoning and harmful use of alcohol occur within the context of wider, often structural, stressors and are influenced by commercial entities.

Excessive alcohol use and binge drinking — definition, risks, and harm-reduction tips are as follows: Excessive alcohol use includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than the legal drinking age, and binge drinking is defined as consuming 4 or more drinks during a single occasion for women and 5 or more drinks during a single occasion for men. Excessive alcohol use, including binge drinking, is associated with short-term and long-term health conditions, increases a person's chances of engaging in risky sexual activity, and is also associated with unintentional injuries and violence. Tips for drinking less include setting limits, counting drinks, managing triggers, and being around people who support moderation in or abstinence from drinking.

### Changing public perceptions of alcohol, alcohol harms and alcohol policies: a multi-methods study to develop novel framing approaches [^3b267a6a]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Expert and public views of alcohol, alcohol harms, causes of alcohol harms and solutions.

When asked about 'causes of alcohol harm', participants placed a strong focus on individual‐level deficits in personality, biology or behaviour (people drinking alcohol to cope) and sought to differentiate 'other' people as dependent on alcohol, who were viewed as different from themselves. Participants were keen not to directly stigmatise or vilify. They rarely discussed structural drivers of alcohol harms (such as commercial activities) apart from noting the widespread availability of alcohol. Regarding solutions, participants focused on downstream interventions like alcohol treatment services and funding for health care, and much less on (upstream) prevention. Individual agency and self‐control were seen as key mechanisms to avoid harm. Participants demonstrated ambivalence about culture change and about restrictions on alcohol advertising and promotion or days/hours of sale on the few occasions these were mentioned, being unsure about their efficacy or fairness. They were similarly ambivalent about the role or responsibilities of alcohol companies.

In contrast, public health experts conceptualised alcohol as an inherently risky and addictive substance that needed to be handled carefully by society. They focused on two main causes of alcohol harm: societal expectations and norms of alcohol consumption that exert pressure on people to drink, and a deficit of regulation to address widespread marketing and availability of alcohol, including cheap alcohol. They saw alcohol harms as being much more diverse than the public, affecting people, services and society beyond individual drinkers and viewed alcohol culture as a dynamic phenomenon, which could be shaped to reduce harms.

Given the contrast between public and expert views, we identified six key communication tasks for novel framing approaches (Table 3). In short, we aimed to build public understanding of alcohol as a toxic drug (task 1) that causes diverse harms for diverse people (task 2), as a result of marketing, policy deficits and commercial activities (tasks 3 and 4), while normalising choices not to drink alcohol (task 5) and creating a collective belief that harms can be reduced (task 6).

### Binge drinking [^334ac8f8]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Neurobiology of intoxication, blackout, and hangover — blood alcohol concentration (BAC) thresholds and acute harms are delineated: intoxication "usually occurs at a BAC of 50 to 150 mg/dL," with worsening depressant effects "When the BAC exceeds 150 mg/dL." Alcohol poisoning risk is noted when BAC rises "usually around a median of 450 mg/dL," with manifestations of "stupor, coma, and death by respiratory depression with respiratory acidosis and hypotension." Blackouts relate to the amount consumed and are "more common in adolescents than adults," with average blackout levels among adolescents and college students at "males consume 9 drinks and females consume 5 drinks," during which individuals may engage in high‑risk behaviors, including unprotected sex leading to unplanned pregnancy. Alcohol affects memory formation as "Alcohol specifically interferes with the brain's ability to make long-term memories from short-term memories and experiences," and hangover symptoms "usually occur within 6 to 24 hours after a heavy or prolonged drinking episode."

### Alcohol consumption in relation to risk and severity of chronic widespread pain: results from a UK population-based study [^5a309d7c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Aside from consideration of the possible mechanisms whereby an association is observed, we think it is important to evaluate to what extent a causal mechanism is likely. Hill 20, in proposing his factors to consider whether an association was causal or not, identified one necessary criterion: temporality. The postulated risk factor must precede the onset of disease (or symptoms). From the available evidence of the 2 studies, it is not possible to determine that this criterion is met. Both were cross‐sectional studies and could be observing the consequences of having CWP of a particular severity. For example, in our study it may be that persons who have less disabling symptoms have few restrictions on their daily activities (including social activities) and are able to more fully engage in pastimes that give rise to opportunities for social consumption of alcohol. That may be true also for the comparison of persons with and without CWP. However, in our current study we have a category of "never having regularly consumed alcohol," and persons in this category have a high prevalence of CWP and (if they have CWP) high levels of disability. Provided that persons are truthfully answering the questionnaire, their alcohol consumption cannot have changed after the development of fibromyalgia and does suggest that persons who have never consumed alcohol have a high risk of symptoms/disabling symptoms. In terms of other factors proposed by Hill, only strength (i.e. the observed associations are large) and biologic gradient (i.e. risk appears to be related to dose) are definitely satisfied. In terms of specificity (i.e. is the relationship only observed with CWP/fibromyalgia?), it is of note that a relationship between alcohol consumption and health has been observed for both general health and specific health conditions 21. In a seminal prospective study of approximately half a million US adults followed from 1982–91, Thun et al 22 reported mortality rates from cardiovascular disease to be significantly lower among men (relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.7–0.8) and women (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6–0.7) reporting at least 1 drink daily (i.e. at least 7 units/week) than among nondrinkers, with little relation to the level of consumption. Overall mortality rates were lowest among those consuming 1 drink per day, although mortality rates increased among heavy drinkers. A so‐called J‐shaped pattern of alcohol consumption and overall mortality has been reported in other major studies 23, 24. Specifically, alcohol consumption has also been related to increased mood, quality of life 25, and physical health 26. Therefore, any effect of alcohol consumption on pain is not specific, and an alternative mechanism to a direct effect is that alcohol has positive effects on general health, which influences the reporting of pain. Indeed, general health status has been found to be a strong predictor of pain onset in epidemiologic studies 27, 28. Alternatively, alcohol may have no positive effects on health at all either directly or indirectly, and drinking within limits that are regarded in society as normal may simply be a marker or indicator for those with healthier lifestyles and beneficial levels of certain risk factors 21.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^42981ff3]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Injuries

Alcohol use has long been identified as a major contributor to injuries of all kinds, with established causal links (for details see previous reviews 23, 24). Blood alcohol concentration is the most important dimension to impair vision, psychomotor skills/abilities and reaction‐time; all these processes and others in the central nervous system can be affected negatively, starting at as low as 0.03% blood alcohol concentration by volume 310. In addition, as already mentioned above, judgement about risk‐taking and other behavioural actions is impacted by alcohol use, again dose‐dependent. The dose–response relationship between acute alcohol use, measured through the blood alcohol concentration and injury, seem exponential for all injury types, albeit varying slightly by type of injury 311, 312, 313.

However, there is also interindividual heterogeneity, based in part on usual drinking habits. For instance, Krüger and colleagues found that for any given blood alcohol concentration, the risk for traffic injury would be lower for a driver who is a regular heavy drinker than for a light drinker 314. In other words, average volume of alcohol use also plays a role, even though this complexity of an interaction between acute and typical alcohol use is not modelled in current CRAs 315 or in other modelling of alcohol‐attributable injury harm 316.

The impact of alcohol use on suicide may be different from other types of injury, as it seems to be determined more by long‐term drinking patterns, such as heavy drinking or alcohol use disorders (e.g. 317, 318, even though there are also acute effects of alcohol use, e.g. on judgement 319, 320. Thus, it should be considered to model suicide in future CRAs differently from other types of injury, with more emphasis on chronic patterns of drinking, in particular heavy drinking.

Current modelling of alcohol‐attributable injuries in CRAs takes into account the number of drinking occasions of different sizes and the relative risks associated with these different exposures (for the most comprehensive analyses on risk relations see 311; for others see 312, 313; for the exact methodologies see 321, 322). The last estimation, as part of the larger study for the WHO European Region estimating alcohol‐attributable mortality in more than 50 countries for 25 years, revealed 178 that alcohol‐attributable injury rates did not decrease in the time‐period in the same way as injuries in general 323.

The final consideration about alcohol‐attributable injury is the estimation of harm to others than the drinker from injuries, which is described below.

### Screening and intervention for mental health disorders and substance use and misuse in the acute trauma patient [^04476ea6]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol use risk assessment screen — The form asks "How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you are drinking?" with fixed options "1–2 drinks, 3–4 drinks, 5–6 drinks, 7–9 drinks, 10 or more drinks"; captures the "typical drink" using standard volumes "Glass of wine 5 oz./glass," "Cans of beer 12 oz. / can," and "Shots of liquor (1.5 oz. of 80 proof spirit)"; records "What SBIRT services were provided?" with options including "Screening only," "SBIRT Referral to treatment appointment," "SBIRT Attempted but not completed," "SBI and Materials provided," "Declined," and "Materials only provided"; and documents "Risk Level: Low Risk, Moderate Risk, Severe Risk" and "Alcohol or Other Drug: Alcohol, Other Drug, Both."

### Reduced-risk drinking as a viable treatment goal in problematic alcohol use and alcohol dependence [^633264c8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

This review describes and discusses studies related to reduced-risk drinking as an additional treatment option for patients with problematic alcohol use and alcohol dependence. The review provides some empirical support for the following statements: (a) reduced-risk drinking is a viable option for at least some problem and dependent drinkers; (b) abstinence and non-abstinence-based treatments appear to be equally effective; (c) allowing patients to choose their treatment goal increases the success rate. The relatively short follow-up period (1–2 years) of the studies hampers a proper evaluation of the added value of the reduced-risk drinking approach.

### Effect of provision of non-alcoholic beverages on alcohol consumption: a randomized controlled study [^c6f2f683]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although there was no significant difference in the intervention group between alcohol consumption at Week 12 and that at Week 20, the mean value did increase slightly, suggesting that the alcohol consumption-reducing effect of providing non-alcoholic beverages did not persist long term after the intervention was complete. However, the reduction of alcohol consumption over at least 20 weeks is considered beneficial in terms of public health.

The control group in this study also exhibited reduced alcohol consumption at Week 12, on average 2.7 g/day. This change may have been caused by the requirement to keep a drinking diary. According to a systematic review, self-monitoring of substance use disorder was effective in 29% of the analyzed studies, ineffective in 63%, and harmful in 8%. Because people with alcoholism were excluded from the present study, the drinking diary may have effectively reduced alcohol consumption. Assuming that the effect in the control group was the result of keeping a drinking diary, the decreased alcohol consumption observed in the intervention group is speculated to result from the combination of providing non-alcoholic beverages and keeping a drinking diary. For this reason, it may be appropriate to estimate the alcohol consumption-reducing effect of providing non-alcoholic beverages to be 8.8 g/day (i.e. the observed 11.5-g reduction in this group minus the 2.7-g reduction in the control group). The cost of the 12-week intervention required to reduce alcohol consumption by 8.8 g/day per person was 19,658.5 yen (approximately 144.8 US dollars; 1,061,564 yen divided by 54 [participants]). Because it has been suggested that there is a negative association between the price of non-alcoholic beverages and the number of consumers of such beverages, a price increase is likely to result in fewer purchasers. Therefore, the results of this study, specifically the low dropout rate, may be attributable to the fact that non-alcoholic beverages were provided free of charge. Further research is necessary to determine how the results and dropout rate are affected when participants are required to pay the costs themselves.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^ebeb719d]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Substance use — alcohol and services recommendations and related epidemiology are as follows. Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who drink > 2 alcoholic drinks a day for men or > 1 alcohol drink a day for women should be counseled to eliminate or reduce their consumption of alcohol to reduce stroke risk. In patients with stroke or TIA who have a substance use disorder (drugs or alcohol), specialized services are recommended to help manage this dependence. The population attributable risk for stroke from harmful alcohol consumption (> 30 drinks per month or binge drinking > 5 drinks per day at least once per month) is 3.8% (99% CI, 0.9–14.4), and in those with known hypertension, binge drinking markedly increases cardiovascular mortality risk and is cumulative (HR, 4.41 [95% CI, 1.38–14.1] for ≥ 6 drinks).

### Taking pleasure seriously: should alcohol research say more about fun? [^657007a6]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This paper invites discussion on whether pleasure should receive more attention in public health-oriented research on alcohol. While there is a history of sociological and anthropological literature exploring alcohol and pleasure, this is much less common in public health-oriented alcohol research, and associated advocacy.

Argument

We propose three broad reasons why more extensive engagement with issues of pleasure may be important for public health-oriented research. The first is epistemological: because overlooking pleasure risks leaving a gap in knowledge of a key component of, and motive for, drinking. The second is ethical: because the prioritisation of long-term health over shorter-term pleasures is not uncontested, and needs to be explicitly justified. The third is pragmatic: because ceding the discourse on pleasure to other actors (including commercial ones) risks undermining effective engagement with target populations.

Conclusions

There is strong case for more attention to pleasure in public health-oriented alcohol research. Key to this is the further development of interdisciplinary perspectives and mixed-methods research. This brings both conceptual and methodological challenges, many of which remain unresolved; however, bringing these issues to the surface may enable greater clarity on both normative principles (including arguments against research engaging with pleasure) and practical questions concerning the design of research and analysis in this area.

### Alcohol use by youth [^1dbb89ab]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Alcohol use by youth — DSM-5 severity thresholds and pediatric applicability are described as follows: The disorder is characterized as mild (2–3 symptoms), moderate (4–5 symptoms), or severe (6 or more symptoms). As defined by the DSM-5, an adolescent, especially a younger one, may not yet have had time to develop an AUD, yet the adolescent may be engaging in very risky behavior, and several of the criteria, such as withdrawal, are not typically experienced by adolescents, and other criteria, such as tolerance, have low sensitivity for adolescents. Tolerance can be anticipated as a developmental process that will occur over time in most adolescents who drink; thus, an adolescent may present with a subsyndromal level of alcohol use that may not meet the formal threshold for addiction or an AUD but that may still be associated with significant impairments in social functioning and well-being. Alcohol misuse, although not a formal diagnosis, can be defined as "alcohol- related disturbances of behavior; disease, or other consequences that are likely to cause an individual, his/ her family, or society harm now or in the future," and because the term "alcohol misuse" encompasses earlier stages of AUDs that do not meet diagnostic criteria, it may be a more useful concept clinically in pediatrics and when developing alcohol use primary prevention programs for youth.

### Commentary on horn et al.: the outcome expectancy in the 'alcohol-gambling cocktail' [^3c4db70b]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

In short, within the framework of alcohol outcome expectancy theory, Horn and colleagues' meta‐analysis provides strong empirical evidence that alcohol outcome expectancy is a 'theoretical software or pathway', through which alcohol intake affects gambling behaviour. In the gambling field, Horn and colleagues partly answer the recent call for a systematic review of literature on alcohol outcome expectancy theory. Importantly, they show the indispensability of alcohol outcome expectancy assessment and control in experimental studies on the effect of acute alcohol intake on gambling behaviour. Furthermore, they underscore the importance of developing alcohol outcome expectancy measures specific to the gambling context as a compliment to measures of gambling outcome expectancy in experimental studies on this topic. Such work will elevate the evidence base on the effect of alcohol intake on gambling behaviour.

### An exploration of the dynamic longitudinal relationship between mental health and alcohol consumption: a prospective cohort study [^c2835a92]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Implications and directions for future work

We identified that the dominant process underlying the dynamic relationship between alcohol consumption and mental health at a population level is mental health. Consequently, it could be inferred that targeting interventions to those with poor mental health (as well as introducing measures to ensure that those with normal/good mental health do not deteriorate) would have a beneficial effect in terms of reducing heavy drinking. This may also elicit favorable knock-on effects in terms of improving general physical health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, as heavy drinking itself is associated with an increased risk of a range of health problems including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. Furthermore, the finding that mental health affects alcohol consumption may shed some light on the growing literature examining common mental disorders as risk factors for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, because alcohol consumption may be one of many mediators in this relationship.

This work provides further support that on-going efforts to improve mental health at a population level are vital to public health. The proposed implementation strategy seeks both to tackle he social determinants of mental health and to target individuals who are at high risk. To do so, a number of avenues will be pursued, including tackling inequalities in access to services (and ensuring equality in the level of service provided). In addition, conscious efforts are being made to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health issues; perhaps if individuals feel more comfortable talking about their mental health problems or seeking treatment for them, then they will not turn to alcohol as a form of self-medication.

Others may, however, be more cynical of our findings and take them to indicate that 1) consuming large amounts of alcohol is acceptable as it does not increase the risk of developing mental health problems, and 2) that it is reasonable to self-medicate with alcohol in response to psychological distress, as it will not worsen symptoms. However, it would be unwise to use our findings as a justification for drinking in a hazardous manner. Although a person's mental health may not worsen, as highlighted above, increased alcohol consumption would heighten their risk of developing other disorders.

### Cardiovascular complications from consumption of high energy drinks: recent evidence [^46b9a244]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The energy drinks (ED) are caffeinated beverages that are popular among teenagers and young adults. They are aggressively marketed as providing alertness, energy and sex prowess. The EDs in addition to caffeine contain several plant stimulants and simple sugars, which increase their caloric content. The caffeine concentration in these drinks is high and their overconsumption could lead to insomnia, agitation, tremors and cardiovascular complications including sudden death. Alcohol is often mixed with EDs (AMEDs) in the wrong perception that the caffeine in the EDs will prevent the drowsiness and sleepiness from alcohol and allow the person to consume more alcohol. This false perception, could lead to alcohol intoxication and the taking of risky decisions, like driving under the influence of alcohol and the risk of serious physical harm to themselves and others. To prevent the problem of consumption of EDs and AMEDs, the caring physician could help by advising the parents and his young patients about the serious health risks from the consumption of these drinks. In order to grasp the extend of the problem of ED and AMED consumption, we did a Medline search of the English language literature from January 2010 to December 2013, using the terms EDs and alcohol-mixed EDs. All the findings from the recent studies regarding the cardiovascular complications from the consumption of EDs and AMEDs together with collateral literature will be discussed in this review.

### Laboratory models of alcoholism: treatment target identification and insight into mechanisms [^c905fb87]. Nature Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

Laboratory models, including animal tissues and live animals, have proven useful for discovery of molecular targets of alcohol action as well as for characterization of genetic and environmental factors that influence alcohol's neural actions. Here we consider strengths and weaknesses of laboratory models used in alcohol research and analyze the limitations of using animals to model a complex human disease. We describe targets for the neural actions of alcohol, and we review studies in which animal models were used to examine excessive alcohol drinking and to discover genes that may contribute to risk for alcoholism. Despite some limitations of the laboratory models used in alcohol research, these experimental approaches are likely to contribute to the development of new therapies for alcohol abuse and alcoholism.

### Managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^8d5155b4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies. Patients requiring inpatient management are at higher risk of morbidity and require appropriate supportive care, including close monitoring, frequent reassurance, re-orientation to time and place, assessment of safety measures (such as falls and syncope), proper nutrition, folate and thiamine supplementation, and management of electrolyte disturbances (such as hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia). Intravenous glucose administration without thiamine supplementation carries a theoretical risk of worsening Wernicke's encephalopathy, as thiamine is required for carbohydrate metabolism; therefore, intravenous thiamine administration before glucose has been historically suggested. However, glucose delivery should not be delayed in nutritionally compromised patients.

Risk of bias

Across included studies, risk of bias was consistently high in some domains. The majority of articles did not report any pre‐registration information, and only four papers included statistical power calculations or alternative sample size justification. Contrastingly, risk of bias across other domains was consistently low; most studies involved randomisation/counterbalancing of participants and drop‐out rate remained predominantly below 10%. Some domains presented more variation in quality of assessment, with details of experimenter blinding and whether sex was accounted for in recruitment/dosage procedures varying between studies. Overall, risk of bias within studies was mixed (Supporting information Table S3).

### Therapeutic targets in alcohol-associated liver disease: progress and challenges [^e50842d8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex disease with rapidly increasing prevalence. Although there are promising therapeutic targets on the horizon, none of the newer targets is currently close to an Food and Drug Administration approval. Strategies are needed to overcome challenges in study designs and conducting clinical trials and provide impetus to the field of drug development in the landscape of ALD and alcoholic hepatitis. Management of ALD is complex and should include therapies to achieve and maintain alcohol abstinence, preferably delivered by a multidisciplinary team. Although associated with clear mortality benefit in select patients, the use of early liver transplantation still requires refinement to create uniformity in selection protocols across transplant centers. There is also a need for reliable noninvasive biomarkers for prognostication. Last but not the least, strategies are urgently needed to implement integrated multidisciplinary care models for treating the dual pathology of alcohol use disorder and of liver disease for improving the long-term outcomes of patients with ALD.

### What level of alcohol consumption is hazardous for older people? Functioning and mortality in U.S. and english national cohorts [^fb868a76]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate disability plus mortality risks in older people according to level of alcohol intake.

Design

Two population-based cohort studies.

Setting

The Health and Retirement Study (United States) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (England).

Participants

Thirteen thousand three hundred thirty-three individuals aged 65 and older followed for 4 to 5 years.

Measurements

Difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), poor cognitive function, and mortality.

Results

One-tenth (10.8%) of U.S. men, 28.6% of English men, 2.9% of U.S. women, and 10.3% of English women drank more than the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommended limit for people aged 65 and older. Odds ratios (ORs) of disability, or disability plus mortality, in subjects drinking an average of more than one to two drinks per day were similar to ORs in subjects drinking an average of more than none to one drink per day. For example, those drinking more than one to two drinks per day at baseline had an OR of 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8–1.2) for ADL problems, 0.7 (95% CI = 0.6–1.0) for IADL problems, and 0.8 (95% CI = 0.6–1.1) for poor cognitive function. Findings were robust across alternative models. The shape of the relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of disability was similar in men and women.

Conclusion

Functioning and mortality outcomes in older people with alcohol intakes above U.S. recommended levels for the old but within recommendations for younger adults are not poor. More empirical evidence of net benefit is needed to support screening and intervention efforts in community-living older people with no specific contraindications who drink more than one to two drinks per day.

### Toxic alcohols [^6186a3a5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on toxic alcohol poisoning:

- **Definition**: Toxic alcohol poisoning refers to ingestion of short-chain alcohols such as methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol, whose toxic effects result primarily from their metabolites causing metabolic acidosis and end-organ injury. These compounds are distinct from ethanol in both metabolism and toxicity, with characteristic biochemical abnormalities including elevated anion and osmol gaps.
- **Pathophysiology**: Toxic alcohols exert their effects primarily through metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, generating highly toxic organic acids or ketones. Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, leading to cellular hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and selective optic nerve and basal ganglia injury. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids that cause severe metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia from calcium oxalate precipitation, and renal tubular injury. In contrast, isopropanol is converted to acetone, producing CNS depression and ketosis without acidosis. The degree of toxicity and organ involvement correlates with the rate of metabolic conversion and accumulation of these toxic metabolites.
- **Epidemiology**: Toxic alcohol exposures occur thousands of times annually in the US, with cases frequently reported to poison control centers and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most poisonings are accidental or involve intentional ingestion, and patients often present without a clear exposure history, making laboratory assessment essential for diagnosis.
- **Disease course**: Toxic alcohol poisoning typically presents in several stages as the parent compound is metabolized to its toxic byproducts. Methanol is converted to formic acid, which produces high anion gap metabolic acidosis and characteristic visual disturbances such as blurred or "snowstorm" vision, often progressing to optic neuropathy and blindness if untreated. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic and oxalic acids, leading to severe metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, renal injury from calcium oxalate deposition, and multiorgan failure. Isopropanol, metabolized to acetone, causes profound CNS depression and gastrointestinal irritation but no acidosis. Diagnosis relies on recognizing these time-dependent clinical and biochemical changes, especially rising anion and osmol gaps in the absence of a clear exposure history.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Outcomes depend predominantly on the specific alcohol, ingested dose, and time to definitive therapy. Prompt administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor such as fomepizole and, when indicated, extracorporeal removal markedly reduces mortality and long-term morbidity. Delayed treatment permits accumulation of toxic metabolites and is associated with irreversible sequelae: formic acid from methanol causes optic nerve injury and potential permanent blindness, while glycolic and oxalic acids from ethylene glycol cause severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure that may progress to CKD. Isopropyl alcohol usually produces less metabolic acidosis but can cause profound CNS depression; very high levels or hemodynamic collapse predict worse outcomes.

### All cause mortality and the case for age specific alcohol consumption guidelines: pooled analyses of up to 10 population based cohorts [^14cbd5cc]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of this study

Estimates of alcohol consumption depended on self reported data, which can be influenced by several factors, including social context and cultural norms, with evidence suggesting that people may alter their response according to perceived social desirability. Accordingly, higher levels of alcohol consumption may have been under-reported, leading to a misclassification of heavier drinkers into lower consumption categories. Such a misclassification may have positively biased the coefficients of lower consumption categories, attenuating any protective effects present among appropriately defined light drinkers. Additionally, heavy drinkers particularly may have opted not to participate in the survey. This combination of potential selection and reporting biases may explain the absence of increased risk among participants within categories of higher alcohol use, as typically identified in meta-analyses.

A further limitation lies in the reliability of participant recall. According to data from the US National Alcohol Survey,52.9% of participants who declared themselves as never drinkers in 1992 had reported drinking in a previous survey. Similar results have also been found with data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study, where 67% of self defined never drinkers reported drinking in a previous wave, with a figure of 53% identified based on follow-up data from the US National Alcohol Survey. Such reporting errors introduce uncertainty about the reliability of associations based on self reported estimates of consumption.

Aside from problems of reliability, the suitability of using referent categories for never drinking is subject to ongoing debate. Although the exclusion of former drinkers from referent categories helped omit less healthy people and reduce the artificial inflation of protective effects among current drinkers, some concern remains about the appropriateness of a never drinking referent category in populations where drinking is normative. It has been found, for instance, that participants who reported illness over consecutive waves of two British birth cohort studies were more likely to have remained non-drinkers over the same period. Taken together, it seems that more than half of never drinkers may be misclassified and that a proportion of correctly defined never drinkers may represent an atypical population subgroup subject to poorer health than the general population in a manner akin to former drinkers. As a consequence, some have recommended the use of occasional drinkers as a more appropriate referent category, although precise definitions differ between publications — ranging, for example, from 1–11 drinks a year (0.02–0.21 drinks/month)to 1–2 drinks a month. When we tested several definitions (see supplementary table 6), the selection of occasional drinkers as a referent category was found to near consistently remove all protective dose-response effects.

### 'Nothing can be done until everything is done': the use of complexity arguments by food, beverage, alcohol and gambling industries [^a5d8be7b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Twenty of the 37 submissions from international spirits, wine and beer producers to the WHO Global Strategy on Alcohol referred to the complexity of the problem, and 25 argued against 'one-size-fits-all' solutions. The two concepts often appeared together, as in the following statement by the Brewers Association of Australia and New Zealand Inc. (2009):

"Alcohol misuse is not a problem of simple, linear cause and effect relationships. Instead, a raft of complex and interacting factors underlie a society's attitudes and actions towards alcohol use, dramatically reducing the likely effectiveness of any intervention taken in isolation. Therefore, it is essential that the background and diversity of societal and cultural settings be fully considered in any strategy".

This quote also illustrates another aspect of complexity that is very often highlighted in these submissions and elsewhere as a reason why they claim that policies are likely to be ineffective: variations in cultural contexts.

An underpinning aspect of the use of complexity by these industries is the distancing of their role in contributing to the policy issue at hand. Such a framing may be chosen because it is of value in litigation. For example, McDonalds has successfully used arguments about the multifactorial causation of obesity to defend itself against a class action taken against it by two New York teenagers who argued that the company was liable for their obesity (Pelman vs McDonalds Corp, 2002). McDonalds argued successfully that obesity is complex and multifactorialand that the plaintiffs needed to show that other possible causes of their obesity (ie, other than a McDonalds diet) were ruled out. They argued:

"The plaintiffs'… physical conditions are inherently the result of a combination of so many factors and influences that attempting to attribute proximate cause to the consumption of certain of the products served at McDonald's is impossible as a matter of law."

### A systematic review with meta-analysis on the relation between acute stress, alcohol consumption and cortisol levels in individuals with a personal, familial or no alcohol use disorder [^6322488a]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose-dependency of alcohol effects on cortisol responses

Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that acute alcohol consumption inherently acts as a stressor, thereby increasing cortisol reactivity (C MaxMin ↑) beyond what is observed after a placebo. This observation is specifically tied to the quantities of alcohol that was actually consumed in the studies we analysed, which ranged from 1.17 g to 2.0 g of pure alcohol per kilogram bodyweight, particularly noting those in a higher dose range exceeding 1 g of pure alcohol per kg bodyweight (that was met by 4 out of the 20 contributing studies). For a 70 kg individual, this equates to the consumption of 82 g to 140 g of pure alcohol, or roughly 2 to 3.5 litres of beer, 0.75 to 1.3 litres of wine, or 65 to 444 mL of 40 Volume % hard liquor. Our analyses indicate that increasing the quantity of consumed alcohol decreases cortisol recovery (C Min ↑) but had virtually no effect on the cortisol reactivity (cf. Tables 2 and 3). Remarkably, this pattern of effects at high doses mirrors those observed in AUD+ individuals. Therefore, our analyses suggest that higher doses of alcohol may indeed act as stressors, potentially increasing cortisol reactivity, although the relevance of such high doses exceeding 2.0 g of pure alcohol per kg/bodyweight to typical alcohol consumption patterns among individuals meeting AUD criteria remains debatable. The precise pharmacodynamics of an effective alcohol dose in terms of impacting cortisol reactivity cannot be formally explored in our meta-analyses. However, as long as the quantity of consumed alcohol remained below 1 g per kilogram bodyweight, doubling the quantity has virtually no effect on cortisol recovery. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that studies using high doses of alcohol should administer relative doses exceeding the maximum dose of 2.0 g per kg bodyweight threshold. Comparable to the dose restriction of our meta-analysis, the majority of studies that contributed to our analyses involved alcohol self-administration paradigms in relatively young and healthy individuals, as indicated by the maximum mean ages reported in Table 2 and Table 3, all below 40 years. Thus, stress-induced changes in alcohol consumption and stress-/drug-induced cortisol responses in older individuals, particularly those beyond the mean age of AUD onset (mid-40s), or in abstinent individuals who previously met AUD criteria (irrespective of ethical considerations) might differ from our findings. These differences could be due to age-related impairments or long-term effects of alcohol consumption. Consequently, our analyses highlight the need for future research to include higher doses of alcohol and older individuals with diverse statuses of AUD and FH of AUD, to enhance our understanding of alcohol-related changes in cortisol responses and to refine models of AUD development and progression.

### Counselling for alcohol problems (CAP), a lay counsellor-delivered brief psychological treatment for harmful drinking in men, in primary care in India: a randomised controlled trial [^e2179028]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders comprise various conditions related to excessive alcohol consumption, with hazardous drinking, harmful drinking, and dependent drinking reflecting progressively more serious forms. Alcohol use disorders contribute substantially to disability and premature mortality, accounting for 7·9% (95% CI 6–10) of years lost to disability and 44·4% (29·1–60·0) of years of life lost because of all mental and substance use disorders. Among men in middle-income countries, alcohol use disorders are the leading neuropsychiatric cause of disease burden. In India, alcohol-attributable mortality and prevalence of alcohol use disorders relative to the per-person volume of alcohol consumed are high.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We updated WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme systematic review with our own systematic review. We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, and IndMed databases from Jan 1, 1990, to Jan 1, 2011, for English language publications using the following search terms: "alcohol", "drinking", "addiction", "psychological", "therapy", "counselling", and "treatment". Brief psychological treatments based on motivational enhancement have been shown to be effective for management of harmful drinking and are recommended as first-line interventions by WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme for delivery in routine health-care settings. However, the existing evidence has low generalisability to many low-income and middle-income countries where both supply side barriers (low availability of mental health professionals) and demand side barriers (low levels of mental health literacy) lead to large treatment gaps.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^24b913c4]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

What is known and what is new?

The relationship between alcohol intake and high BP was established over a century ago, albeit clarity on the mechanisms involved is still lacking. Large-scale observational studies report that the incidence of hypertension increases with any amount of alcohol consumed by men and with more than two standard drinks per day by women. Moreover, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 RCTs, described a significant reduction in BP associated with a decrease in alcohol consumption in people with hypertension who consumed three or more drinks per day in a dose-dependent manner. The largest reduction in BP [SBP: −5.5 mmHg (95% CI: −6.7 to −4.3) and DBP: −4.0 mmHg (95% CI: −4.7 to −3.3)] was reported in individuals with a baseline consumption of six or more drinks per day. Additionally, both trial data and observational literature support the hypertensive effect of binge drinking.

Even though previous observational data have suggested a decrease in CVD with light drinking compared with abstainers, these analyses are limited by selection bias and confounding with other associated health behaviours. Mendelian randomization studies do not support the purported protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption and suggest that the lowest risks for cardiovascular outcomes are in abstainers and that any amount of alcohol uniformly increases BP.

International perspective

Patterns of alcohol intake vary widely across the world, in terms of frequency, type of alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, spirits), and associated behaviours. Globally, the annual average consumption of pure alcohol per person is 6.18 l (the equivalent of 1 l of wine per week at 12% alcohol content). Consumption varies from particularly low across North Africa and Middle East (close to zero) to high in Europe (highest as 15 l per person annually or the equivalent of over two bottles of wine per week in the Czech Republic). Binge or heavy drinking (defined as consuming at least 60 g of pure alcohol or six standard alcoholic drinks on one occasion in the past 30 days) also varies internationally, and is more common in parts of Central and West Africa, as well as Russia. Sex and gender differences in alcohol consumption (men drinking more) are wider when the average consumption in a country is low (e.g. in North Africa and Middle East). The type of alcoholic beverage consumed also varies, with spirits being predominant in countries such as India, Philippines and China, whereas beer is commonly consumed in Eastern Europe and wine in Western Europe.

### Correlates of alcohol consumption among Germans in the second half of life. results of a population-based observational study [^1619da3e]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

For this year, a total of n = 7820 individuals took part in the study and provided information on alcohol consumption (gross sample: n = 23,984). Alcohol consumption was not assessed in former waves. The survey consisted of a face-to-face computer-assisted personal interview at the participants' homes and a drop-off questionnaire (n = 7952). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Dependent variable

Alcohol intake (exact wording: How often do have a drink containing alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, sparkling wine, spirits, long drinks) was self-reported as 'never' (non-drinkers); 'rarer than once a month', 'one to three times a month', 'once a week', or 'several times a week' (collapsed into the category occasional drinkers); and 'daily' (daily drinkers). The threshold for a "risky" alcohol intake was considered as daily alcohol consumption ("non-risky": otherwise). A time frame (e.g. last 6 months or last year) was not specified. Thus, ex-drinkers would fall into the category of non-drinkers. This will be addressed in the discussion section.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^26d3118c]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

WARNING:

OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, which is a morphine-like opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance, with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics.

Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing OPANA ER in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.

OPANA ER is an extended-release oral formulation of oxymorphone indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.

OPANA ER is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic.

OPANA ER Tablets are to be swallowed whole and are not to be broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed. Taking broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed OPANA ER Tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone.

Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription medications containing alcohol, while on OPANA ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone.

### An addiction agency's collaboration with the drinks industry: moo joose as a case study [^63ca4a2f]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

This paper analyses a partnership between an addiction agency and the drinks industry in Australia, with special reference to concerns held by public health advocates for such projects.

Method

Public health anxieties regarding collaboration between the drugs sector and the drinks industry are identified. A projected partnership between the Alcohol and Drug Foundation — Queensland (ADFQ) and the liquor industry in Australia is reviewed. The partnership involves the creation of a new organization, Alcohol Education Australia Ltd. (AEA), which states as its aim the education of consumers in responsible drinking. In order to assess the impact of the partnership an examination is undertaken of the AEA's stated mission and objectives, of relevant policy development by ADFQ and of ADFQ's intervention in support of an alcohol manufacturer which was putting a case to a licensing authority.

Findings

The results indicate the partnership advances the interests of the drinks industry rather than public health. The mission and objectives of Alcohol Education Australia Ltd subordinate public health goals to industry aims and the host organization, the ADFQ, has changed its policy and practice to accommodate the drinks industry.

Conclusion

The partnership between the ADFQ and the drinks industry indicates the difficulty faced by addiction organizations in maintaining an uncompromising public health orientation when in partnership with the alcohol industry.

### Changing public perceptions of alcohol, alcohol harms and alcohol policies: a multi-methods study to develop novel framing approaches [^1d32e6f1]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Stage 3: Development and consultation on potential framing approaches to address the differences found in stage 2

The workshop session generated 31 preliminary framing ideas, which were reduced to a final shortlist of 12 fully developed framing approaches (titles in Table 4; full text in supplementary file). The main considerations in drafting and shortlisting were the review findings (e.g. using narrative and explanation more than statistics, avoiding crisis messaging or a focus on economic costs, emphasising a continuum of alcohol problems rather than a focus on dependence, and using metaphor) and the input of stakeholders involved (e.g. ease of understanding and relatability, avoiding scaremongering/despair, and raising awareness of harms before focusing on solutions). The final shortlist consisted of values‐based, metaphor‐based and explanation‐based framing approaches.

TABLE 4
Titles of framing approaches developed in this study (see full text in supplementary file).

Five values‐based approaches included two focusing on 'truth'. Frame 1 suggests that the truth about alcohol has been 'twisted' over time to make it seem essential to diverse social occasions, highlighting how advertising plays into this. Frame 2 outlines the lack of information for consumers on diverse alcohol harms, problematizes advertising, and emphasises the need for the public to be 'told the truth', including on labels. Frame 3, based on 'ingenuity', outlines that we have the knowledge and ability, as a society, to reduce alcohol harm. Frame 4, a 'fairness'‐based approach, suggests that it is not fair that big alcohol companies are allowed to profit from customers suffering alcohol‐related harms. Frame 5 is based on the value of 'freedom' and questions the central role of alcohol in society and whether people are really free to choose whether to drink or not.

### Reduction of alcohol consumption and subsequent mortality in alcohol use disorders: systematic review and meta-analyses [^563f368d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a reduction in drinking in individuals with alcohol use disorders resulted in reduced mortality risk.

Data Sources

Electronic searches were performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science and references of identified articles were searched up to May 2012 using these keywords: (alcohol dependence OR alcohol abuse) AND (mortality) AND (cohort OR follow-up). Only English-language articles were included.

Study Selection

Sixteen cohort studies were identified that reported all-cause mortality risk by drinking groups measuring change in alcohol intake among people with alcohol use disorders.

Data Extraction

Numbers of participants and deaths in each group; odds ratios (ORs); and demographic, clinical, and methodological variables were extracted.

Results

In comparison to continued heavy drinking, a reduction below heavy levels of alcohol use (including abstention) was associated with a substantially reduced risk of mortality (random-effects pooled OR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34–0.50; P < .001). The OR was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20–0.60; P < .001) for those who reached abstention and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39–0.94; P = 0.026) for those who did not reach abstention but substantially reduced their consumption. The pooled OR for abstention compared to reduced consumption was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.19–0.92; P = 0.031). Meta-regression models did not reveal significant influences of study characteristics examined.

Conclusions

Reduction of drinking in alcohol use disorders was associated with a marked reduction in mortality risk for those who reached abstinence or reduced drinking compared to continued heavy drinkers. Those who reached abstention showed the smallest mortality risk, lower than the risk for reduced consumption without abstinence.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Department of Defense populations and alcohol/illicit substance use — Alcohol misuse is a major concern in the DoD, and binge drinking and heavy drinking occur at higher rates among those in uniform compared to their civilian counterparts, with this predominantly young, male demographic particularly vulnerable to substance use and risks long-term damage. Up to 27% of Soldiers returning from war have problems related to alcohol use, and these combat-exposed Soldiers and Marines also have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, problems that alcohol use may worsen; alcohol problems also contribute heavily to problems of indiscipline, which erode readiness, end careers, and impact individuals and families. Despite these concerns, the DoD has substantially lower rates of illicit substance use than civilian or VA populations.

### Measuring alcohol consumption for genomic meta-analyses of alcohol intake: opportunities and challenges [^0e5f3949]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Whereas moderate drinking may have health benefits, excessive alcohol consumption causes many important acute and chronic diseases and is the third leading contributor to preventable death in the United States. Twin studies suggest that alcohol-consumption patterns are heritable (50%); however, multiple genetic variants of modest effect size are likely to contribute to this heritable variation. Genome-wide association studies provide a tool for discovering genetic loci that contribute to variations in alcohol consumption. Opportunities exist to identify susceptibility loci with modest effect by meta-analyzing together multiple studies. However, existing studies assessed many different aspects of alcohol use, such as typical compared with heavy drinking, and these different assessments can be difficult to reconcile. In addition, many studies lack the ability to distinguish between lifetime and recent abstention or to assess the pattern of drinking during the week, and a variety of such concerns surround the appropriateness of developing a common summary measure of alcohol intake. Combining such measures of alcohol intake can cause heterogeneity and exposure misclassification, cause a reduction in power, and affect the magnitude of genetic association signals. In this review, we discuss the challenges associated with harmonizing alcohol-consumption data from studies with widely different assessment instruments, with a particular focus on large-scale genetic studies.
