## Question

What are the titer levels of acute infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what titer levels indicate an acute infection and how to interpret them across different pathogens, with attention to timing, assay differences, and the concept of a correlate of protection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definition of a titer and what "acute infection" implies immunologically. Then, I should verify timing windows for seroconversion across pathogens. Next, I will examine specific examples for SARS-CoV-2, HIV, HCV, and dengue to anchor quantitative expectations. After that, I should review the concept of a 4-fold rise in paired sera and how that operationalizes "acute" serologically. Finally, I need to check limitations and exceptions, including immunocompromised hosts, assay variability, and the distinction between detection of infection and prediction of protection, before summarizing practical takeaways [^116pmtwK] [^1117ob7Y].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't jump to conclusions: a "titer" is a numerical measure of antibody level against a specific antigen, whereas "acute infection" refers to the early phase of disease when the pathogen is actively replicating and symptoms are typically present; importantly, "titer level" is not a single universal number and must be interpreted in the context of the pathogen, timing since exposure or symptom onset, and the assay used, which is a key point I need to keep in mind throughout [^111rR5rh] [^1117ob7Y].

> Wait, let me verify the timing window for serologic detection of acute infection because that drives what counts as an "acute titer". For many viral infections, IgM appears several days after onset, IgG shortly thereafter, and serology becomes most informative around 2–3 weeks; for example, SARS-CoV-2 serology is generally not useful in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset, and optimal performance is often at 3–5 weeks, which is why guidelines recommend against early serology for acute COVID-19 diagnosis [^113Q2vGM] [^113aCera] [^115tnwmD] [^111LsMvp].

> I will now examine SARS-CoV-2 as a concrete anchor. Let me think about neutralizing antibody dynamics: around 3–4 weeks after symptom onset, NT50 values commonly fall in the 100–200 range, but there is wide individual variability spanning undetectable to > 10,000; initially I thought this meant NT50 around 100–200 is "typical", but hold on, I should correct that: the median is closer to 100–200 while the distribution is broad and right-skewed, so a given individual's "acute titer" could be much higher or lower depending on disease severity and timing of sampling [^116dThq6] [^113yZau6] [^114fFsax].

> Next, I should review how we interpret a "significant" change. A 4-fold or greater rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent samples is the conventional serologic standard for confirming acute infection across many pathogens, reflecting a robust anamnestic response; I need to ensure paired samples are timed 2–3 weeks apart to capture this rise reliably, as single-sample "acute titers" are often indeterminate without a baseline or convalescent comparison [^1117ob7Y] [^111Vmuzp].

> Let me consider HIV next, because the acute phase has different serologic signals. In acute HIV, viral RNA is typically very high (often > 100,000 copies/mL) while antibodies are not yet detectable; therefore, an "acute titer" in this context refers to the viral load rather than antibody level, and any detectable HIV RNA with a negative or indeterminate antibody test supports acute infection, even if the RNA is as low as 200 copies/mL early on, though higher viremias are common [^114EpQpT] [^1113LDvL].

> I should confirm HCV kinetics as well. In acute hepatitis C, HCV RNA is detectable 1–2 weeks after exposure, often before antibody seroconversion, and early RNA levels can fluctuate; while some define a low-level viremia range (for example < 10⁴ IU/mL) as suggestive of acute infection dynamics, I need to be careful because RNA levels alone do not distinguish acute from chronic disease and must be interpreted with clinical context and serial testing [^113qm2ZT] [^114RZ33h].

> Hold on, I should verify dengue as another exemplar. For dengue, the PRNT is the gold standard, and acute infection is supported by seroconversion or a 4-fold or greater rise in PRNT titer on paired sera; importantly, early in infection (first 5–7 days), IgM/IgG may be absent, so molecular testing is preferred initially, and later serology can show characteristic patterns, but absolute PRNT "acute titers" vary widely by individual and laboratory method, underscoring that titer magnitude is not standardized across platforms [^111UY2QG] [^114CKTg1].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is "how high does a titer need to be to indicate protection"? I should double-check that no single protective titer has been established for SARS-CoV-2, despite correlations between higher neutralizing or binding antibody levels and reduced risk of infection; models estimate that neutralization at roughly 20% of mean convalescent levels associates with 50% protection from infection, while far lower levels may suffice to prevent severe disease, yet guidelines emphasize that routine serology should not be used to infer individual protection or to guide vaccination decisions because assays are not harmonized to a correlate of protection [^113dhQer] [^116pmtwK] [^115tnwmD].

> Next, I should review special populations and assay pitfalls. In immunocompromised hosts, seroconversion may be delayed or absent, so an undetectable or low "acute titer" does not exclude infection; conversely, preexisting antibodies from prior infection or vaccination can confound interpretation of a single sample, making paired sera or nucleic acid testing essential when the stakes are high or the pretest probability is substantial [^111mDWDt] [^113P67ix].

> Let me reconsider a few other pathogens to ensure the principles generalize. For babesiosis, IgM ≥ 1:16 or IgG ≥ 1:1024 suggests active or recent infection, but a 4-fold rise is confirmatory; for rubella, a 4-fold rise or IgM seroconversion is diagnostic; for mumps, a 4-fold rise in IgG or isolation/NAAT is preferred because vaccinated patients may not mount IgM, so a single "acute titer" can mislead without paired testing or virologic confirmation [^115q9Em3] [^112K7SGN] [^113AFvSs].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am not overpromising a single "acute infection titer" threshold. Quantitatively, "acute titers" are pathogen-specific, timing-dependent, and assay-dependent: for SARS-CoV-2, NT50 values around 100–200 at 3–4 weeks are common but range widely; for HIV, "acute titer" means a high viral RNA with negative/uncertain antibodies; for HCV, RNA positivity with early, possibly low-level viremia is expected before seroconversion; for dengue, a 4-fold PRNT rise confirms acute infection despite variable absolute titers; across diseases, a 4-fold rise in paired sera remains the most reliable serologic marker of acute infection when available, and no validated correlate of protection exists to interpret a single titer as "protective" for SARS-CoV-2 outside research contexts [^116dThq6] [^114EpQpT] [^113qm2ZT] [^111UY2QG] [^1117ob7Y] [^116pmtwK].

Titer levels in acute infection reflect the **early immune response** and vary by pathogen, assay, and timing [^111ao95A]. For SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibody NT50 titers typically peak at **100–200** [^116dThq6] about 3–4 weeks after symptom onset, with a 4-fold decline by 3–4 months [^1157U2bb] [^114fFsax]. For dengue, acute infection is defined by a **≥ 4-fold rise in PRNT titer** [^notfound] between acute and convalescent samples. For HIV, acute infection features **very high viral RNA** [^114EpQpT] (> 100,000 copies/mL) with negative or indeterminate antibody tests [^114EpQpT]. For HCV, RNA is detectable 1–2 weeks after exposure [^114RZ33h], often before antibodies, and low or fluctuating RNA levels suggest acute infection [^113qm2ZT]. For babesiosis, IgM ≥ 1:16 or IgG ≥ 1:1024, or a **4-fold rise**, indicates acute infection [^115q9Em3] [^112es1Uf]. Titers are **dynamic** [^115TTyMc] and pathogen-specific, so interpretation must consider timing, assay, and clinical context [^1117ob7Y].

## SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)

- **Neutralizing antibody titers**: NT50 titers typically peak at 100–200 about 3–4 weeks after symptom onset, with a wide range (undetectable to > 10,000) [^116dThq6].
- **Decline**: Titers decline ~4-fold by 3–4 months, then stabilize at a lower plateau [^1157U2bb] [^114fFsax].
- **Severity correlation**: Higher early titers in severe disease, but titers converge by 3–4 months across severities [^114fFsax] [^113yZau6].

---

## Dengue virus

For dengue, acute infection is defined by a **≥ 4-fold rise in PRNT titer** between acute and convalescent samples [^notfound]. PRNT is the **gold standard** [^114CKTg1] for measuring neutralizing antibodies and distinguishing primary from secondary infections.

---

## HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)

In acute HIV infection, **viral RNA levels** are typically very high (> 100,000 copies/mL) [^1113LDvL], with negative or indeterminate antibody tests [^114EpQpT]. Diagnosis relies on **RNA testing** because serology is initially negative; low-positive RNA with a negative antibody test is highly suggestive of acute infection [^114EpQpT].

---

## Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

In acute HCV infection, **RNA detection** occurs 1–2 weeks after exposure [^114RZ33h], often before antibodies, and low or fluctuating RNA levels suggest acute infection [^113qm2ZT]. Antibody seroconversion occurs within 6–12 weeks; **delayed or absent seroconversion** can occur in immunosuppressed individuals [^113qm2ZT].

---

## Babesiosis

For babesiosis, serologic criteria for acute infection include **IgM ≥ 1:16 or IgG ≥ 1:1024** [^115q9Em3] or a **4-fold rise** in titer [^112es1Uf]. Single positive results require confirmation by blood smear or PCR due to antibody persistence [^112es1Uf].

---

## General principles for interpreting titer levels in acute infection

- **Timing**: Seroconversion timing varies by pathogen and assay; early sampling may yield false negatives [^113aCera].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays and laboratories can yield varying results; standardized methods improve comparability [^116C17sd].
- **Clinical context**: Interpret titers alongside symptoms, exposure, and other tests to avoid misclassification [^1143cL2Y].

---

Titer levels in acute infection are **pathogen-specific and time-dependent**; they reflect early immune responses and must be interpreted in clinical and assay context.

Serologic studies are crucial for understanding current and future dynamics of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In the past few months, much discussion about serologic studies and key issues with their design and interpretation has occurred. In this article, we discuss the questions that could be answered with these studies at different points in the epidemic and summarize the features and issues regarding study design, implementation of studies during an ongoing epidemic, and interpretation of the results. Discussion on the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic studies has largely focused on 2 questions: first, what proportion of a population has been infected?; and second, what proportion of a population is immune to disease or infection?

First, for infections that elicit detectable antibody responses, serologic studies can detect past infection regardless of clinical symptoms. This capability is useful for understanding the extent of past transmission (Figure 1, panel A). By linking this information with data on symptomatic cases, severe disease, and death in the same population, these studies can provide information on asymptomatic proportion, and the ratio of infections to severe cases and deaths (i.e. infection fatality ratio). Such data are also useful for calibrating mathematical models.

After infection, each person's antibody levels undergo a dynamic process. A lag occurs from time of infection (white marks) to the generation of antibodies, which peaks several weeks postinfection and varies across persons depending on the time since infection and the parameters governing dynamics of the immune response. B) Antibody and virus dynamics in a person from time of infection. Frequent follow-up samples from the same person (indicated by red dots along the horizonal axis) would inform models of viral load and antibody kinetics. The dashed horizontal line represents the limit of detection of the assay. Early on, viral loads are more sensitive for diagnosing recent infection, whereas antibody titers become more sensitive once the humoral response is mounted and persons recover.

### Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^1157U2bb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Most individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop neutralizing antibodies that target the viral spike protein. In this study, we quantified how levels of these antibodies change in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining longitudinal samples collected approximately 30–152 days after symptom onset from a prospective cohort of 32 recovered individuals with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate-severe disease. Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about 4-fold from 1 to 4 months after symptom onset. This decline in neutralizing antibody titers was accompanied by a decline in total antibodies capable of binding the viral spike protein or its receptor-binding domain. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau. Additional studies of long-lived B cells and antibody titers over longer time frames are necessary to determine the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

HIV-1 transmission risk during acute and early infection — quantitative estimates are as follows: Extremely high levels of infectious virus in serum and genital secretions during acute HIV-1 infection persist for 10–12 weeks; models suggest the rate of sexual transmission during acute infection is 26 times as high as during established HIV-1 infection, and acute HIV-1 infection can account for 10%–50% of all new HIV-1 transmissions, especially in persons with multiple concurrent sex partners or high rates of partner change.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log₁₀ IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^116dThq6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Within a few weeks of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), individuals develop antibodies that bind to viral proteins. A few weeks after symptom onset, serum from most infected individuals can bind to the viral spike protein and neutralize infection in vitro. The reciprocal dilution of serum required to inhibit viral infection by 50% (neutralizing antibody titer at 50% inhibition [NT 50]) is typically in the range of 100–200 at 3–4 weeks after symptom onset, although neutralizing titers range from undetectable to > 10 000.

There are currently limited data on the dynamics of neutralizing antibodies in the months after recovery from SARS-CoV-2. For most acute viral infections, neutralizing antibodies rapidly rise after infection owing to a burst of short-lived antibody-secreting cells and then decline from this peak before reaching a stable plateau that can be maintained for years to decades by long-lived plasma and memory B cells. These dynamics have been observed for many viruses, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 1, and the seasonal human coronavirus 229E.

Several recent studies have tracked antibody levels in individuals who have recovered from infection with SARS-CoV-2 for the first few months after symptom onset. Most of these studies have reported that over the first 3 months, antibodies targeting the spike protein decline several-fold from a peak reached a few weeks after symptom onset, suggesting that the early dynamics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those for other acute viral infections.

Here we build on these studies by measuring both the neutralizing and binding antibody levels in serial plasma samples from 32 SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals across a range of disease severity with follow-up as long as 152 days after symptom onset. On average, neutralizing titers decreased about 4-fold from approximately 30 to > 90 days after symptom onset. This decline in neutralizing titers was paralleled by a decrease in levels of antibodies that bind the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD). Nonetheless, most recovered individuals still had substantial neutralizing titers at 3–4 months after symptom onset.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111LaH5n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent plasma for persons hospitalized with COVID-19. The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114EpQpT]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acute HIV infection — testing and interpretation: Quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA testing should be considered even if the HIV Ag/Ab test result is negative, and HIV infection should be confirmed by repeat quantitative HIV RNA testing or subsequent testing to document HIV antibody seroconversion. Even a low-positive quantitative HIV RNA level (e.g., < 200 copies/mL but detectable) in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody test result is consistent with acute HIV infection; when present at this level, the HIV RNA test should be repeated on a new blood specimen to confirm the diagnosis, and repeated false-positive HIV RNA test results are unlikely. HIV RNA levels in acute infection are generally very high (e.g., > 100,000 copies/mL), however, levels may be < 200 copies/mL in the earliest weeks, and a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result and a positive HIV RNA test result (< 200 copies/mL) indicate that acute HIV infection is highly likely. The previously proposed threshold of < 3,000 copies/mL is based on historical data that are now considered obsolete, and improvements in plasma viral load methodology suggest that any positive result on a quantitative plasma HIV RNA test in this setting may be consistent with acute HIV infection. In settings where testing algorithms use only anti-HIV antibodies, when acute HIV infection is suspected in a person with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result, a quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA test should be performed.

### Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^114fFsax]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have measured the dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers over the first 3–4 months after infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a well-characterized prospective longitudinal cohort of individuals across a range of disease severity. The titers of neutralizing antibodies declined modestly, with the titers at 3–4 months after symptom onset generally about 4-fold lower than those at 1 month. This decline in neutralizing antibodies was paralleled by a decline in antibodies binding to the viral spike protein and its RBD. This decline is generally similar in magnitude to that reported in several other recent studies of antibody dynamics in the months immediately after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Individuals with more severe disease tended to have higher peak antibody responses at 1–2 months after symptom onset, consistent with many other studies reporting higher early titers in severely ill SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals. However, by 3–4 months after symptom onset, neutralizing antibody titers among individuals with severe disease were no longer significantly higher than those of individuals with mild symptoms or even asymptomatic infections. Therefore, it seems possible that the large peak in antibody production in severely ill individuals wanes more dramatically than in milder cases, consistent with severe disease often leading to an exaggerated burst of short-lived antibody-secreting cells.

Importantly, most individuals in our study still had substantial neutralizing antibody titers at 3–4 months after symptom onset. While some recent studies have interpreted a modest drop in titers in the first few months after infection as alarming, it is entirely consistent with antibody responses to other respiratory viruses. Acute infection is always associated with an initial peak in antibody titers due to a burst of short-lived antibody-secreting cells. For many other infections, titers decline from this initial peak but then reach a stable plateau that is maintained for years or even decades by long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells that can be recalled during subsequent infections.

The modest declines in antibody titers that we observe over time do have implications for efforts to collect convalescent patient plasma for use in treatment of sick individuals. FDA guidelines suggest minimum cutoffs for the antibody activity in such convalescent plasma (eg, NT 50 > 160;). Our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors collected in the first few months after symptom onset will be more likely to meet these cutoffs; others have made a similar observation. In addition, our results indicate that if an individual is donating convalescent plasma over time, each plasma sample should be tested for antibody titers to ensure that they remain above the FDA cutoff.

### Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113dhQer]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7–13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.

### Discrete SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers track with functional humoral stability [^116oLFmf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Antibodies serve as biomarkers of infection, but if sustained can confer long-term immunity. Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to SARS-CoV-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity-defined by the level of antibodies-is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response. This response activity level may be essential for durable protection, potentially explaining why re-infections occur with SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses.

### SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune responses in convalescent individuals over 12 months reveal severity-dependent antibody dynamics [^1144V1AE]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Khoury and colleagues recently modeled neutralizing antibody titers relative to reported protection from multiple vaccine studies to suggest that just 3% of mean convalescent antibody levels were sufficient to protect against severe infection. This finding suggests that low levels of antibodies are sufficient to protect against severe disease and mitigate reinfections, likely because antibodies provide immune protection through mechanisms beyond neutralization, such as opsonization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Our study extends prior research, demonstrating that anti-RBD levels remain above control levels up to 12 months post-infection for participants across acute disease severities. Although less than 12% of participants in our cohort retained 50% of their initial RBD antibody titers beyond 6 months post-infection, and none retained 50% titers at 12 months post-infection, we find that anti-RBD levels remain above control levels up to 12 months post-infection for participants across acute disease severities. These findings suggest that most convalescent individuals retain sufficient antibody titers for protection against severe infections for up to 12 months after infection. Interestingly, antibody titers in participants with more severe disease decayed faster than in participants with mild disease. While the basis for this difference is not known, severe patients may have fewer circulating plasmablasts entering the long-lived plasmablast compartment, resulting in more rapid decay of serum titers. Alternatively, antibodies in severe patients may be cleared from circulation more rapidly due to reduced FcRn-mediated recirculation or increased Fc-mediated clearance from circulation. Despite their faster antibody decay rate, participants who experienced severe acute COVID-19 disease had such high titers at 1 month that they retained higher levels of anti-N and anti-RBD antibody titers over the course of 12 months compared to participants who experienced mild disease.

### Current knowledge and future perspectives on acute hepatitis C infection [^111VfnKB]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are frequently seen worldwide in certain risk groups, with an annual incidence rate varying between 0.08% and 66%. Although this incidence is substantial, a delayed diagnosis during chronic infection is most often made in the absence of clinical symptoms in the acute phase of the infection. Currently used methods to diagnose acute HCV infection are IgG antibody seroconversion and repeated HCV RNA measurements, although no definitive diagnostic test is currently available. Progress in the field of adaptive and innate immune responses has aided both advances in the field of HCV vaccine development and a more basic understanding of viral persistence. The rapid changes in the treatment of chronic HCV infection will affect therapeutic regimens for acute HCV infection in the coming years, leading to shorter treatment courses and pegylated interferon-free modalities. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge and uncertainties, together with some future perspectives on acute hepatitis C epidemiology, virology, immunology, and treatment.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — recommendation on clinical use states that higher antibody levels generally correlate with protection, but a single titer that predicts protection has not been identified; therefore, antibody testing (either with binding antibodies [bAb] or neutralizing antibodies [nAbs]) to assess immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not recommended routinely, and antibody testing should not be used to guide vaccination, revaccination, or booster decisions; more research and standardized assays calibrated to an international standard are needed to clarify roles such as identifying "nonresponders".

### The diagnostic utility of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity in distinguishing between past and acute infection of west nile virus (WNV) [^111obKT8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
IgG avidity, IgG levels, and neutralization of acute and past WNV-infected individuals. Scatter plot analysis of relative avidity index (RAI) (A), IgG levels (B), and neutralization titers (C) in confirmed WNV acute and past-infected individuals. The black bars indicate mean (for avidity and IgG) or GMT (for neutralization) ± 95% CI. Reciprocal neutralization titers are depicted.

As mentioned, several commercial assays as well as a study aimed to differentiate between early and late antibody response to WNV defined IgG avidity below 40% as acute infection and IgG avidity above 60% as past infection despite using different IgG avidity kits and reagents. Therefore, we first evaluated the performance of the IgG avidity assay based on this 40–60% criteria. Sensitivity based on this criterion in identifying acute infections was 83% (95% CI: 74–90) with a specificity of 85% (95% CI: 77–90). The sensitivity to exclude acute infections was 60% (95% CI: 51–69) with a specificity of 88% (95% CI: 79–93). Taken together (Table 1), the sensitivity and specificity to detect acute infection based on avidity of below 40% and past infections based on avidity of above 60% are 87% (95% CI: 78–93) and 80% (95% CI: 70–88), respectively. It is important to note that in this scenario, avidity between 40% and 60% is considered intermediate and therefore could not be interpreted as past or acute infection.

TABLE 1
Diagnostic tests based on known criteria (40% acute, 60% past)

While sensitivity and specificity of the assay are important and describe its performance, the utility of avidity as a tool used to differentiate between acute and past WNV infection depends on the PPV and NPV of the assay. In order to determine the PPV and NPV of IgG avidity, we need to estimate the prevalence of WNV confirmed infection in our population, i.e./, the ratio of WNV confirmed infections diagnosed at the CVL among the total number of samples with a positive WNV IgG. First, we assessed the ratio of suspected WND among all IgG-positive samples. Between 2015 and 2023, serum samples from 5,164 cases were sent to the CVL for diagnosis of WNV disease. Of the 1,023 serum samples positive for WNV IgG antibodies, 248 samples (24%) were also positive for IgM.

### Dynamic immune profile in French toxoplasmosis patients [^111U56S8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results demonstrated that the acute phase was the most dynamic part of the immune reaction during T. gondii infection. While this has been shown previously, no study specifically looked at the dynamics within this phase. Indeed, we observed a great variability of values, or sometimes 2 or more distinct populations, during this phase, whereas this was very rarely the case in noninfected and chronically infected patients. This led us to conclude that the heterogeneous cytokine levels were due to clear-cut dynamics within the acute phase. These were especially evident in pattern A, where the markedly increased cytokine levels were clearly confined to the early phase of acute infection. Even if we cannot determine the exact timing corresponding to these IgG titers, the initially increased cytokine levels in this pattern seem to drop at an early time point. This result could be important to interpret the acute phase in future studies, as well as to determine the infection status of individual patients in difficult diagnostic situations, like persistent IgM production or acute infection without IgM antibodies.

In conclusion, we characterized the serum cytokine levels in a European setting with predominantly type II strains and observed substantial secretion of Th1 and Th2 cytokines during acute infection, as well as an anti-inflammatory bias during chronic infection. Additionally, our results found that most cytokine activation occurred in the initial phase of the acute infection. These results could pave the way to better understand the immune dynamics of T. gondii infection, especially when including subsequent localized pathologies such as ocular toxoplasmosis in further studies, and thus help to guide diagnosis and treatment.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — evidence from expanded access program (EAP) analyses, randomized trial subgroups, and FDA actions is as follows: In the EAP, higher levels of antibodies were associated with significant improvements in mortality compared to receipt of convalescent plasma with lower concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, but there was no placebo group, and the intervention has been used in over 100,000 patients. In one open-label randomized controlled trial subgroup using a high antibody titer cutoff, mortality showed a non-significant relative risk reduction of 5% (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.25), whereas another subgroup analysis suggested unselected convalescent plasma may increase the relative risk for mortality by 49% (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.69). Timing may be important, as the EAP suggested greatest benefit when given within three days from diagnosis. The FDA issued an EUA for investigational convalescent plasma in August 2020 and revised it in early February 2021 to limit authorization to high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma for treatment of hospitalized patients early in the disease course. The evidence base referenced includes 23 RCTs and a large single-arm registry study (n = 20,000).

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115q9Em3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Babesia and malaria serology — use cases and thresholds — plays little role in diagnosis of acute infection because antibodies may not appear early and titers may be too low; the primary use of antibody detection is for epidemiologic studies and as evidence of previous or relapsing infection, and serologic testing is also used for blood donor screening. For Babesia, indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) is the most readily available commercial assay; IgM titers ≥ 1:16 and IgG titers ≥ 1:1024 indicate acute infection as does a 4-fold rise in titer. IgG titers of 1:64–1:512 with negative IgM and no titer rises in serial specimens suggests previous infection or exposure, and there is insufficient evidence for use in diagnosis of B. divergens, B. duncani, or MO-1 infections.

Longevity of anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers in participants relative to uninfected control participant titers

To evaluate when anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers decline to levels of uninfected control participants, we compared anti-N and anti-RBD IgG titers in infected participants over 12 months post-confirmed infection relative to the 95% quantile of titers in uninfected control participants (Fig. 4e, f). We observed that the frequency of participants with anti-N titers over control levels declined faster for non-hospitalized compared to hospitalized participants (asymptotic logrank two-sample test p value = 0.002). At 1 and 3 months post-infection, over 50% of non-hospitalized and hospitalized participants had antibody titers exceeding the 95% quantile of control levels (Fig. 4e, f). By 6 months, 46.5% of non-hospitalized and 71.8% of hospitalized participants maintained anti-N antibody levels above control titers. Finally, by 12 months, less than 25% of non-hospitalized and 50% of hospitalized participants retained anti-N antibody levels above control titers, demonstrating a faster decline in the frequency of non-hospitalized participants whose anti-N titers remain above control levels. Interestingly, although anti-RBD titers decayed with time (Fig. 4b), they remained above the 95% quantile of pre-COVID-19 control levels over 12 months, regardless of acute disease severity (Fig. 4f).

Other considerations — waning of antibody levels over time after natural infection and vaccination has been noted, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies may be more short-lived in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals; comparing results between studies is often difficult because of the different antibody assays used.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titer levels in pregnant individuals after infection, vaccination, or both [^11259vZF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

We examined differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses in pregnant individuals with natural, vaccine-induced, or combined immunity. Participants had live or nonlive births between 2020 and 2022, were seropositive (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, anti-S), and had available mRNA vaccination and infection information (n = 260). We compared titer levels among three immunity profiles: 1) natural immunity (n = 191), 2) vaccine-induced immunity (n = 37), and 3) combined immunity (ie, natural and vaccine-induced immunity; n = 32). We applied linear regression to compare anti-S titers between the groups, controlling for age, race and ethnicity, and time between vaccination or infection (whichever came last) and sample collection. Anti-S titers were 57.3% and 94.4% lower among those with vaccine-induced and natural immunity, respectively, compared with those with combined immunity (P < .001, P = 0.005).

IDSA serologic testing — diagnosis in the first 2 weeks: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that serologic testing should not be routinely performed for diagnosis of acute COVID-19 and that accuracy may be worse in vaccinated or previously infected populations; anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, and serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase.

### Nucleocapsid antigenemia is a marker of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113pxLvX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is essential for diagnosis, treatment, and infection control. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fails to distinguish acute from resolved infections, as RNA is frequently detected after infectiousness. We hypothesized that nucleocapsid in blood marks acute infection with the potential to enhance isolation and treatment strategies. In a retrospective serosurvey of inpatient and outpatient encounters, we categorized samples along an infection timeline using timing of SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptomatology. Among 1860 specimens from 1607 patients, the highest levels and frequency of antigenemia were observed in samples from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antigenemia was higher in seronegative individuals and in those with severe disease. In our analysis, antigenemia exhibited 85.8% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity as a biomarker for acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, antigenemia sensitively and specifically marks acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study is warranted to determine whether antigenemia may aid individualized assessment of active COVID-19.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — discussion context highlights that early in the pandemic there was intense interest in identifying a correlate of protective immunity, and research showed that prior infection and vaccination reduce risk and that neutralizing antibodies and higher binding antibody concentrations provide greater risk reduction; yet despite these discoveries, and after almost 500 million infections and administration of 13.5 billion vaccine doses, the hope for a single marker of protection remains unrealized, current clinical indications for antibody testing are few, and seroprevalence approaches 100% in most human populations.

Babesiosis serology confirmation and diagnostic thresholds — single positive antibody tests require confirmatory testing: For patients with a positive Babesia antibody test, we recommend confirmation with blood smear or PCR before treatment is considered (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A single positive antibody test is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of babesiosis because Babesia antibodies can persist in blood for a year or more following apparent clearance of infection, with or without treatment. For serologic interpretation, a B. microti IgG antibody titer of ≥ 1:1024 or the presence of B. microti IgM antibody are suggestive of active or recent B. microti infection, while a 4-fold rise in Babesia IgG antibody from acute illness to convalescence confirms the diagnosis.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — ambulatory persons: The panel states the overall certainty is low and notes uncertainty about early use, and the guideline panel suggests use only in a narrow outpatient population. Specifically, the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence is low due to concerns with imprecision and recognized the inability to exclude a meaningful beneficial or detrimental effect when convalescent plasma is given early in the course of COVID-19 disease. For outpatients, the guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the ambulatory setting for persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, who have no other treatment options.

### Early biological markers of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116xPZAv]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Strengths of our study include the high degree of adherence to the biospecimen collection protocol and the collection of biospecimens in close proximity to initial symptom onset in a cohort of outpatients, who comprise the vast majority of individuals with PASC. The inclusion of a large proportion of individuals from earlier waves of the pandemic, prior to the widespread availability of vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 treatment, or reinfection allowed us to study the natural history of this condition in the absence of these confounding factors. However, this analysis has several limitations. Due to relatively small cohort size, we were unable to evaluate whether early markers were associated with specific symptomatic phenotypes of PASC, each of which may be driven by different biology. We defined PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since SARS-CoV-2 infection present during the post-acute period, without requiring that the same symptom be present during the acute period; it is possible that this could result in misattribution of some unrelated symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is mitigated somewhat by specific training for study staff to interrogate for the presence of any reported symptom prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We applied a relatively broad time window in which PASC could be defined (2 to 6 months), which although consistent with accepted case definitions might be subject to variability by time since infection (either waxing and waning or resolving symptoms). Future assessment of individuals during later timepoints (e.g. 6 months or beyond) following infection may be warranted. The current analysis focuses on the binary presence or absence of symptoms and does not include consideration of symptom severity or impact. Such assessment could lead to further insight into whether different viral titers and immune responses can affect the severity of symptoms rather than simply their presence or absence. Finally, although mitigated through use of multiple imputation, missing data from declined blood sample collection could be a source of error.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^114suyQN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing natural infection found no direct evidence to correlate serologic testing with improved outcomes, but cohorts showed lower reinfection among those seropositive. The guideline identified 6 studies, 5 cohort and 1 case control, that evaluated relationships between antibody level and decreased SARS-CoV-2 reinfection; 5 studies assessed binding antibodies and 1 assessed neutralizing antibodies. Across the cohort studies, subjects with a seropositive result after infection appeared to have a lower likelihood of developing reinfection, and in the case control study, doubling of the antibody level was associated with reduced odds of reinfection, though study definitions, timing, tests used, and comparison groups varied.

### Management of acute HCV infection in the era of direct-acting antiviral therapy [^114Gwcuh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The management of acute HCV infection has not been standardized following the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic HCV infection, and substantial uncertainty exists regarding the optimal treatment regimen and duration. Despite the lack of direct evidence, the 2016 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)-Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines supported "the same regimens for acute HCV as recommended for chronic HCV infection… owing to high efficacy and safety", whereas the 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommended sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir or sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 8 weeks in acute HCV infection, with a longer duration of 12 weeks recommended for those infected with HIV and/or baseline HCV RNA levels > 1,000,000 IU/ml. This Review outlines the epidemiology, natural history and diagnosis of acute HCV infection and provides contemporary information on DAAs for acute and recent HCV infection. The Review also discusses the 2016 AASLD-IDSA and EASL recommendations for acute HCV infection management in light of available evidence and highlights key differences in study populations and design that influence interpretation. We focus on populations at high risk of HCV transmission and acquisition, including people who inject drugs and HIV-positive men who have sex with men, and highlight the potential effects of diagnosis and treatment of acute HCV infection in contributing to HCV elimination.

### Truvada [^111PBuWn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during, sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month.

If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2 and 14.3)].

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^11712jbg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — summary statement and benefits/harms note that the overall quality of evidence was very low because of risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision, and it is unclear if patient outcomes are any different because of testing; it is therefore unclear if serologic testing provides any benefit for patient care decisions or to patients. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests help identify people who may have been infected or were vaccinated, but a universal antibody level predictive of protection from reinfection after infection or vaccination has not been identified. The panel did not identify any benefits to antibody testing in most individuals to inform management decisions, though there may be selected scenarios for immunocompromised hosts where serologic testing could be considered, such as patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and significant humoral immune impairment being evaluated for treatment with convalescent plasma.

### Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^111U3e51]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dynamics of Spike Protein–Binding and RBD-Binding Antibodies Over Time

For all plasma samples, we also used ELISAs to measure IgA, IgM, and IgG binding to the RBD of the spike protein, and IgG binding to the full spike protein ectodomain. Figure 2A shows each individual's IgA, IgM, and IgG binding antibody titers as quantified by the AUC of the ELISA readings (see Methods for detailed description). Like neutralizing antibody titers, these antibody binding titers tended to decrease over time, although there was substantial variation among individuals. All of the ELISA-measured antibody-binding titers are clearly correlated with neutralizing antibody titers (Figure 2B).

Individuals with severe disease had higher antibody binding titers at early time points. Specifically, individuals who were hospitalized as part of their care had higher IgG, IgA, and IgM binding responses than asymptomatic or symptomatic nonhospitalized individuals at approximately 30 days after symptom onset (Figure 2C). By approximately 60 days after symptom onset, anti-RBD IgM levels were no longer significantly different between severity groups, and by > 90 days after symptom onset, binding responses did not differ between severity groups for any antibody subtype. This trend is consistent with data in Figure 1C showing that neutralizing antibody responses were higher for individuals with more severe disease early during convalescence but reached similar levels across all disease severity groups by > 90 days after symptom onset. Among all patients, regardless of disease severity, IgA and IgM levels decreased more than IgG levels from approximately 30 to > 90 days after symptom onset, consistent with findings of other studies.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without community-acquired pneumonia. what do PCR and serology say? [^1128fm9A]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

IgM titers of Mycoplasma pneumoniae can remain high for months or years, and specific DNA can be detected in asymptomatic people.

Methods

We compared the performance of serology and PCR in children with and without community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae.

Results

In children with CAP, a positive test by M. pneumoniae (PCR and/or paired serology or both) were found in 13.9%. Of these, 10.3% were positive by multiplex PCR (Seeplex-Seegen), and 6.7% exhibited quadrupled titers (22 for IgG, 6 for IgM and 5 for both). Both tests were positive in 2.8% of cases. In the group without CAP, 3.3% were positive by PCR. Thirty-two percent of children with CAP and 38.3% of healthy children had IgM titers > 11 in the acute phase.

Conclusions

The detection of IgM is not useful for diagnosing acute M. pneumoniae infection, and a positive PCR result can be due to colonization and not infection. New and better diagnostic techniques are required.

### Comparison of levels of nasal, salivary, and plasma antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during natural infection and after vaccination [^115N5ADw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Most studies of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) measure antibody or cellular responses in blood; however, the virus infects mucosal surfaces in the nose and conjunctivae and infectious virus is rarely if ever present in the blood.

Methods

We used luciferase immunoprecipitation assays to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the plasma, nose, and saliva of infected persons and vaccine recipients. These assays measure antibody that can precipitate the SAR-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins.

Results

Levels of plasma anti-spike antibody declined less rapidly than levels of anti-nucleocapsid antibody in infected persons. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody levels in the nose declined more rapidly than antibody levels in the blood after vaccination of infected persons. Vaccination of previously infected persons boosted anti-spike antibody in plasma more than in the nose or saliva. Nasal and saliva anti-spike antibody levels were significantly correlated with plasma antibody in infected persons who had not been vaccinated and after vaccination of uninfected persons.

Conclusions

Persistently elevated SARS-CoV-2 antibody in plasma may not indicate persistence of antibody at mucosal sites such as the nose. The strong correlation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the nose and saliva with that in the blood suggests that mucosal antibodies are derived primarily from transudation from the blood rather than local production. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccine given peripherally boosted mucosal immune responses in infected persons, the increase in antibody titers was higher in plasma than at mucosal sites. Taken together, these observations indicate the need for development of mucosal vaccines to induce potent immune responses at sites where SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs.

### The duration, dynamics, and determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses in individual healthcare workers [^1125z7TV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Measurable immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens develop after many, but not all, SARS-CoV-2 infections. Serological responses are typically detectable within 1–3 weeks. This allows antibody assays to be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected. Additionally, although the extent of immunity associated with different antibody titers and other immune responses is yet to be fully determined, it is probable that antibody levels will provide some information about the risk and/or severity of future infection.

However, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels are dynamic over time. This has implications for epidemiological studies; for example, if IgG levels fall below detection thresholds before they are measured, past infections may be underascertained. Similarly, it has implications for estimating population protection if antibodies are a marker for protective immunity.

Contrasting data have been made available on the longitudinal trajectory and longevity of antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, a US study showed IgG antibody levels to trimerized spike were relatively stable in 121 individuals around 110 days post symptom onset. Similarly, data from 1215 individuals in Iceland suggest that IgG responses to nucleocapsid and the S1 component of spike were sustained for 100–125 days. However, others have noted declines in neutralizing antibodies over similar time periods.

We have recently undertaken baseline serological testing in a cohort of > 10 000 healthcare workers (HCWs). We now describe serial SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements, demonstrating quantitative anti-nucleocapsid responses fall over time and vary with age, ethnicity, and previous symptoms, but anti-spike levels antibodies remain stably detected in most individuals.

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (truvada) [^112zydhb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Some HIV-1 tests only detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, ask seronegative individuals about recent (in past month) potential exposure events (e.g., condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, or a recent STI), and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash).
If recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

While using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs.

If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

Counsel HIV-1 uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the once daily TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials of TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Microbiology (12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3 and 14.4)].

TABLE 2
Performance of the avidity assay

Since IgG antibodies measure quantity of antibodies, IgG avidity reflects the quality and affinity of these antibodies, and neutralization titers are a measure of both quality and quantity, we assessed the correlation between these parameters. For acute and past infections, the correlation coefficient between avidity and IgG levels was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.42–0.7) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52–0.75), respectively, and between avidity and neutralizing titers was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.04–0.48) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.34–0.65), respectively (Fig. 3).

Correlation between avidity, IgG levels, and neutralizing titers. Correlation of avidity and neutralizing titers and avidity and IgG levels in samples obtained from acute (left panel) and past (right panel) WNV-infected individuals is presented.

### High serum levels of norovirus genotype-specific blocking antibodies correlate with protection from infection in children [^116D4p4d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis in children. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been implicated in protection against norovirus-associated gastroenteritis, but the level, specificity, and functionality necessary for protection remain to be elucidated.

Methods

Norovirus-specific IgG antibodies to genogroup II (GII)-4–2010 New Orleans (NO), GII-4–1999, GII-12–1998, GI-1–2001, and GI-3–2002 virus-like particles (VLPs) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples collected from children who presented to the hospital because of acute norovirus gastroenteritis in 2009–2011. The blocking activity of the antibodies was tested in a surrogate neutralization assay.

Results

Most norovirus infections (62.8%) in the study population were caused by a GII-4 NO variant. Children who acquired GII-4 NO infection had a low preexisting type-specific IgG level and blocking activity of the sera, in contrast to children infected with other GII genotypes. Following GII-4 NO infection, genotype-specific seroconversion and a corresponding increase in blocking antibody potential was observed. Although seroconversion to the heterologous GII-4–1999 variant was observed, there was no corresponding increase in the specific blocking antibody titer. There was no concomitant seroconversion against GI VLPs, indicating a highly genogroup-specific antibody response.

Conclusions

High preexisting norovirus genotype-specific serum IgG titers and blocking activity in children indicate protection from norovirus infection in a strain-specific manner.

### Dengue plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in primary and secondary dengue virus infections: how alterations in assay conditions impact performance [^114CKTg1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a worsening global health problem. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is currently considered to be the "gold standard" to characterize and quantify circulating levels of anti-DENV neutralizing antibody (NAb). Many variations of the PRNT are currently in use and neither the assay nor its performance conditions have been standardized or harmonized between laboratories. We used a well-characterized panel of acute and late convalescent follow-up sera samples from children experiencing primary and secondary DENV infections to evaluate the performance of the dengue PRNT under a variety of testing conditions. Investigators varied cell type, control virus passage, and the use of complement across multiple assay runs of the same sample panel. Our findings indicate wide variation in PRNT titer results in response to varied testing conditions.

Some HIV-1 tests only detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP, ask seronegative individuals about recent (in past month) potential exposure events (e.g., condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, or a recent STI), and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash).
If recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

While using DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs.

If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

Counsel individuals without HIV-1 to strictly adhere to the once daily DESCOVY dosing schedule. The effectiveness of DESCOVY in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in a clinical trial of DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Microbiology (12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3)].

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112j2jYZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Treating early HIV infection — goals of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early infection are to suppress plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels (AI), prevent transmission (AI), and preserve immune function (AIII), and ART should be initiated as soon as possible after a positive qualitative or quantitative HIV RNA test result (AII). Same-day or rapid ART initiation in people with acute HIV has been shown to be safe, acceptable, and effective, and it is important to collect a new blood specimen for a confirmatory HIV antibody test and quantitative plasma HIV RNA test to verify HIV diagnosis. Given the sensitivity of current assays, a positive quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA with a negative or indeterminate antibody test indicates that acute HIV infection is highly likely; HIV treatment does not need to be delayed while awaiting confirmation, and individuals who do not begin ART immediately should be maintained in care with efforts to initiate therapy when ready. Clinical trial data indicate that treatment during early HIV infection may yield immunologic and virologic benefits, early HIV infection is considered a period of high infectivity, and early ART substantially reduces the risk of HIV transmission.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^116gF36Y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

To complement the analysis of soluble immune effectors, we performed flow cytometry to quantify the immune cell types present during infection (Supplementary Figure 5). Nearly all immune cell types examined were significantly increased in the infected wounds compared to the healthy skin at 1 and 3 dpi (Supplementary Figure 6); and neutrophil infiltration correlated with neutrophil-related chemokine expression in the infected wounds compared to the mock-infected controls (Figure 7A and C). Notably, at 3 dpi, there were significantly more MHCII − macrophages in the infected wounds compared to mock-infected controls (Figure 7D). Despite the presence of significant immune infiltrates at 3 dpi, the E faecalis bacterial burden in the wounds persisted at > 10⁵ CFU.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that high-titer inocula, resulting in high-titer wound infection, is associated with an acute inflammatory response concomitant with the peak of infection. The resolution of acute high-titer infection to a lower steady-state infection at 3 dpi corresponds to a suppression of cytokine and chemokine levels but also the presence of immune cellular infiltrate, suggesting a complex immunomodulatory program that is insufficient to resolve acute E faecalis wound infection.

### IgG seroconversion and pathophysiology in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^112Lw7bM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We investigated the dynamics of seroconversion in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. During March 29-May 22, 2020, we collected serum samples and associated clinical data from 177 persons in London, UK, who had SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes, demographic information, and laboratory characteristics. We found that 2.0%-8.5% of persons did not seroconvert 3–6 weeks after infection. Persons who seroconverted were older, were more likely to have concurrent conditions, and had higher levels of inflammatory markers. Non-White persons had higher antibody concentrations than those who identified as White; these concentrations did not decline during follow-up. Serologic assay results correlated with disease outcome, race, and other risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serologic assays can be used in surveillance to clarify the duration and protective nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Third COVID-19 vaccine dose boosts neutralizing antibodies in poor responders [^113xUKFh]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although healthcare policy may recommend that a population should receive a third COVID-19 vaccination at a particular time point, an inexpensive rapid test could provide personalized NAb levels on an individual basis to indicate who might or might not require a third dose. Not only would this conserve vaccine, but vaccinating individuals who already have elevated levels of NAbs may not provide benefit since spike protein could be cleared by circulating NAbs as fast as it is made by cells.

Previous reports indicate that NAb levels decline much more rapidly than protection from hospitalization and disease, but that does not account for vaccine recipients who never generated high levels of NAbs after two doses. Moreover, it is possible that VPRs could be a source of breakthrough infections. Although it is not known what levels of NAbs protect from infection or disease, many vaccine recipients in high-risk professions may wish to keep peripheral NAb levels high, limiting infection, asymptomatic viral replication, and potential transmission.

Although vaccine durability studies indicate an average neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) of ≥ 320 during the peak period after 2nd dose, the distribution among individual serum samples obtained during the observed peak neutralization period (4 to 30 days post-2nd dose) varies greatly. It is unclear what percentage of a population falls below a given GMT or IC 50 during the peak neutralization period following 2nd dose. Our study supports other findings that majority of healthy individuals generate a NAb response ≥ 75% neutralization (IC 50 ≥ 160 and < 320). However, we highlight a VPR population that, despite healthy status at the time of vaccination, fail to mount a NAb response > 50% (IC 50 < 160) after two doses.

Poor NAb titers have been reported in special populations such as patients with ongoing cancer therapies, solid organ transplant patients –, and individuals on systemic immunosuppressive regimens for various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, current literature is lacking regarding protective antibody responses to COVID-19 in a healthy population. Finally, it is not unprecedented in other vaccine settings such as influenza to observe poor or non-neutralizing responses in healthy individuals. Due to the urgency to develop vaccines to slow the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still learning the parameters of mRNA vaccine dose, frequency, timing and durability in the human population.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^113RqqZC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing vaccination identified 10 postvaccination studies including 6 cohort studies, 1 clinical trial, 1 systematic review, and 2 case control studies evaluating binding antibody level and SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. Results were inconsistent: 5 studies reported a correlation between seropositivity and decreased infection rates, whereas 2 reported no difference between those who had seroconverted after vaccination and those who had not. The number of breakthrough infections in some studies was small and several studies focused on immunocompromised populations. The presence of nAbs appears to correlate with protection against breakthrough infection, but a single titer or threshold antibody level predictive of protection has not been identified; quantitative results are not commutable across assays unless calibrated to a common reference standard, and no studies measured the predictive value of hybrid immunity.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for determining dengue serostatus: a systematic review and key informant interviews [^111UY2QG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

The choice of tests for dengue diagnosis depends on the timing and purpose. For the diagnosis of acute DENV infection, tests are based on DENV isolation, presence of dengue viral antigens, detection of viral nucleic acid in blood through techniques such as RT-PCR, IgM seroconversion, and/or a four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titre in paired blood samples collected at least 14 days apart. Dengue virus and antigen detection are the most accurate diagnostic tools during the first 5 days of illness, as IgG and IgM antibodies are not produced until 5–7 days after the onset of symptoms in primary infections. IgM levels can become undetectable after 3–6 months, whereas IgG levels often persist over an individual's lifetime and can be used to indicate previous DENV infection. Hence, for the detection of past DENV infections, IgG antibodies to DENV serve as a marker of past DENV infection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are the most commonly used laboratory-based serology assays to measure DENV IgG. However, ELISAs are time-consuming and require significant laboratory infrastructure, including instrumentation, trained staff and refrigeration for reagents. Delays in turnaround time would hamper vaccination campaigns as patients would likely be lost to follow up if required to return several days later for vaccination. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which measures the titre of neutralizing antibodies against DENV infection, has also been used to evaluate dengue serostatus, but is even more laborious and expensive than ELISA, and hence not routinely used. All serological assays can exhibit some degree of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as Zika, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever viruses.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could enable quick, simple screening in areas where DENV is endemic, which are often resource-limited and do not have the laboratory capacity to perform ELISA or PRNT testing. RDTs would also provide results at the point-of-care to ensure safe vaccine administration. However, the disadvantage of currently available RDTs is that they have not yet been validated for screening for past DENV infection and may lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to ensure effective vaccination strategies. As RDTs have typically only been evaluated in the context of acute DENV infection and not for the detection of past infection, a systematic review was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of commercially available RDTs used for detecting IgG antibodies against DENV as a marker of previous DENV infection.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^116C17sd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Applicability of findings to the review question

In the background, we outlined five possible roles for antibody testing, two of which we did not further consider in this review (serial testing to assess immune response and selection of seronegative COVID‐19 patients for monoclonal antibody treatments). We here consider the evidence for the remaining three use cases:

Diagnosis of infection in patients presenting with symptoms of suspected COVID‐19, particularly where molecular testing had failed to detect the virus and if earlier antibody test results (soon after onset of symptoms) were negative. It is unclear how generalisable our results for weeks one to three after symptom onset are to people who present either in the community or in hospital settings with a negative RT‐PCR result but ongoing and potentially concerning symptoms. A large proportion of studies included in this review iteration collected data from patients in the acute phase of disease in hospital inpatient settings, with less than 15% clearly recruiting individuals from community or emergency care settings. As noted in the Index test(s) section, where COVID‐19 vaccination rates are high, antibody tests that can distinguish between antibodies to the N‐ and S‐ proteins would be needed to distinguish SARS‐CoV‐2 infection from vaccination induced antibodies. Because the studies included in this review were conducted before vaccines against COVID‐19 were available, we have not been able to assess test performance for vaccination‐induced antibodies compared to antibodies from infection.
To assist diagnosis when patients present with a multi‐system inflammatory syndrome or other post‐acute sequelae of COVID‐19, and no clear diagnosis of SARS‐COV‐2 infection in the immediately preceding weeks, including individuals with mild or no symptoms of COVID‐19 during the acute phase (current or previous infection). Our results are likely to be applicable to this use case scenario, with the caveat that individuals who were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms at the onset of infection may not have mounted the same level of antibody response by week three or week four as the participants included in the studies in our review, many of whom were hospital inpatients.
In seroprevalence surveys to estimate the prevalence of detectable antibodies resulting from infection in a community at any given point in time. Our results for convalescent‐phase infection may be applicable to this use case, bearing in mind the caveats around how we have been able to define convalescent or 'prior' infection and the lack of very long‐term follow‐up in the studies included. Because IgG persists for the longest time after infection, results for IgG assays are likely to be the most relevant for this use case. We found some evidence to suggest that quantitative assays, especially CLIAs are more sensitive than rapid LFAs. Our heterogeneity investigations according to the antigen or protein used in the test kit suggested no obvious effect on IgG assay sensitivity during the convalescent period, i.e. assays using N‐ alone, S‐ alone or N‐ and S‐proteins had on average similarly sensitivities (around 90%). These results imply that as long as at least three weeks have passed since symptom onset, antibody tests have the potential to detect around 90% of those infected. With a maximum reported participant follow‐up of only around 100 days, we are not able to comment on the duration of time that this level of sensitivity is maintained after infection, nor could we directly address the accuracy of tests for detecting vaccination‐induced antibodies. The choice of test (or tests) for seroprevalence surveys and the specific antigens used in those tests will dictate whether or not previous infection can be differentiated from vaccination response, as per CDC guidelines (CDC 2021b). Sensitivity varies between test brands, however. Although we have not captured all available evaluations of all available test brands, the included direct comparisons of tests have shown variations in sensitivity of as much as 40.6 percentage points between 11 different LFAs (Rudolf 2020 [A]) or 46.6 percentage points between three laboratory‐based assays (Gudbjartsson 2020 [A]). Even restricting to comparison of assays using the same protein does not necessarily reduce the difference in sensitivity. High specificity of tests is essential in seroprevalence testing, which appears likely for many of the tests included in this review. The suitability of pre‐pandemic samples to establish specificity requires further discussion. We found specificity for IgG assays was on average one percentage point lower for tests evaluated in those where COVID‐19 was ruled out after initially being suspected ('suspected COVID‐19' group) compared to pre‐pandemic samples. This either reflects misclassification as not having SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or a true lower specificity in those presenting with symptoms.

### Influenza A (H7N9) virus antibody responses in survivors 1 year after infection, China, 2017 [^112cfyTW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Table 3
Proportion of influenza A(H7N9) virus survivors with titers at seroprotective levels at acute phase of infection and 3 follow-up points after infection, China, 2017*

*Seroprotective levels for HI, NI, and MN titers, > 1:40; IgG > 1:400; or IgA > 1:50. HI, hemagglutination inhibition; MN, microneutralization; NI, neuraminidase inhibition.

The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibodies were plotted by the time points in Figure 2. Overall, ≈300 days after symptom onset, HI and NI GMTs substantially declined and were lower than the seroprotective threshold of 1:40 and the GMTs in the acute phase (Figure 2, panels A and B). In contrast, the MN GMTs increased over time, peaked on day 200, and then declined by day 300, yet remained considerably above the GMTs in the acute phase and the seroprotective threshold of 1:40 (Figure 2, panel C). Although we observed no substantial difference in GMTs across 3 follow-up time points, the MN GMTs on day 200 were relatively high, suggesting a possible delayed response after infection. IgG and IgA decreased gradually from day 100 to day 300 but remained higher than the limit of detection (Figure 2, panel D). However, IgG GMTs on day 200 and day 300 were substantially higher than the IgG GMTs in the acute phase, whereas the IgA GMTs on day 200 and day 300 were similar to those in the acute phase. There were no detectable antibodies to the H7N9 virus in the control subjects, but GMT was 283.3 (titer ranged from 1:200 to 1:800) for IgG, suggesting a possible cross-reactivity between the H7N9 virus and other subtypes.

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (truvada access) [^114wzUK5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Some HIV-1 testsonly detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, ask seronegative individuals about recent (in past month) potential exposure events (e.g., condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, or a recent STI), and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash).
If recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

While using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs.

If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

Counsel HIV-1 uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the once daily TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials of TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Microbiology (12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3 and 14.4)].

### Leptospirosis as frequent cause of acute febrile illness in Southern Sri Lanka [^113UcUF7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Notably, detection of acute-phase IgM did not predict which patients had acute leptospirosis, despite its widespread use as an acute diagnostic test. Retrospective studies suggest sensitivities and specificities of 36%–53% for single acute-phase IgM and 90%–99% for MAT on paired serum specimens, respectively. The varied sensitivity likely reflects different case definitions and control groups, timing of acute-phase specimen collection (up to 42 days after onset), geography and serovar distribution, platforms and protocols (e.g. ELISA ± use of RF absorbent, indirect hemagglutination, and dot-ELISA and IgM dipsticks), and convenience sampling. Notably, ELISA of single (acute-phase) serum specimens has performed as well or better than MAT or indirect hemagglutination of single serum specimens, so those strategies are not advised.

The most widely recognized problem with using acute-phase IgM to identify acute leptospirosis is that many persons in disease-endemic areas are expected to have preexisting antibodies. Some have advocated higher cut-offs to discriminate between acute infection and preexisting antibodies, because patients may be harmed as much by incorrectly attributing fever to leptospirosis as by falsely excluding it. However, data to support this approach are lacking, and misclassification could occur both early in acute infection (impaired sensitivity because antibody is not yet present) and later (impaired specificity because antibody is persistent). In our rigorous comparison of single vs. paired serum specimens, we found acute-phase IgM had especially poor sensitivity (17.5%), since patients sought treatment early (≈3 days), and more acute infections were identified by seroconversion than by a definitive rise in titer. The median duration of illness in those diagnosed by rise in titer versus seroconversion tended to be longer (4 days [IQR 3–5 days] vs. 3 days [IQR 2–5 days], respectively; p = 0.09). Requiring a higher cutoff titer would further impair sensitivity. Hence, acute-phase IgM testing alone has multiple limitations for diagnosis of acute leptospirosis, regardless of the cut-off.

### The diagnostic utility of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity in distinguishing between past and acute infection of west nile virus (WNV) [^112Ymq4g]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Eighty-four serum samples from confirmed acute WNV infections and 103 serum samples from past WNV infections, obtained between 2015 and 2023, were tested for avidity and WNV neutralization. For the 84 samples from acute infection and 103 samples from past infection, RAI, IgG levels (AU) and neutralization titers ranged from 7% to 100% (mean = 26%; 95% CI: 21–31), 0.6–6.1 AU (mean = 2.3 AU; 95% CI: 2.1–2.6) and titers of 20–2,000 (geometric mean titer [GMT] = 183; 95% CI: 144–235) in the acute group and from 9% to 100% (mean = 63%; 95% CI: 59–67), 0.5–6.3 AU (mean = 3.7 AU; 95% CI: 3.4–4.1) and titers of 10–2,000 (GMT = 110 95% CI: 82–147) in the past infection group, respectively (Fig. 1).

### Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^113yZau6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dynamics of Neutralizing Antibody Titers Over Time

We used spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles to measure neutralizing antibody titers in the longitudinal plasma samples from all 32 infected individuals (Figure 1A). All individuals had detectable neutralizing antibody titers (NT 50 > 20) in their first convalescent plasma sample, which was generally collected roughly 1 month after symptom onset. These data are consistent with prior studies showing that most SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals develop neutralizing antibodies. Qualitative inspection of Figure 1A shows that these titers modestly decreased for most individuals over the next few months, although the dynamics were highly heterogeneous across individuals.

To quantify the dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers over time, we calculated the fold change at approximately 60 and > 90 days after symptom onset, relative to the approximately 30-day time point, excluding any individuals who lacked a 30-day sample. Taken across all individuals, neutralizing titers significantly declined from 30 to 60 days, and again from 60 to 90 days (see legend to Figure 1B for details). At > 90 days, the median neutralizing titer was reduced 3.8-fold relative to the 30-day value (Figure 1B). However, most individuals (27 of 32) still had detectable neutralizing titers at the last time point.

We compared the dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers between individuals with different disease severities (Figure 1C). Individuals with more severe disease tended to have higher neutralizing antibody titers during early convalescence, consistent with prior studies. Specifically, at both approximately 30 and approximately 60 days after symptom onset, individuals who required hospitalization had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than those who did not (Figure 1C). From approximately 30 to > 90 days after symptom onset, the NT 50 for symptomatic hospitalized individuals decreased about 18-fold, significantly more than the approximately 3-fold decrease in the NT 50 for nonhospitalized individuals (P = 0.03; Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Supplementary Figure 4). By > 90 days after symptom onset, neutralization titers did not differ significantly between disease severity groups (Figure 1C). At all time points, asymptomatic individuals had neutralization titers similar to those of symptomatic nonhospitalized individuals.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^112xH3Wr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA serologic testing — background on seroprevalence and timing: As of December 2022, more than 96% of the US population was estimated to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the utility of antibody testing has declined as seroprevalence due to vaccination and natural infection has increased. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after onset of symptoms; consequently, serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase and positive results may reflect vaccination or distant history rather than acute or recent infection.

### Analysis of plasma viral RNA levels during acute dengue virus infection using quantitative competitor reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [^112qJgc4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the potential importance of viral burden in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). There is little data available, however, describing the kinetics of viral replication in humans with natural dengue virus (DV) infection. Standard procedures for measuring titers of infectious virus in clinical specimens are either laborious or insensitive. We developed a method for measurement of DV RNA in plasma samples based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a mutant RNA target as a competitor. This technique was reproducible and accurate for samples containing any of the four DV serotypes, and could be applied to samples containing as few as 250 copies of RNA per reaction. We examined plasma viral RNA levels in 80 children with acute DV infection; sequential plasma samples were tested in 34 of these children. Plasma viral RNA levels ranged as high as 10⁹ RNA copies/ml, and correlated with titers of infectious virus measured in mosquitoes (r = 0.69). Plasma viral RNA levels fell rapidly during the last several days of the febrile period. We did not find a significant difference in maximal plasma viral RNA levels between children with DHF and children with dengue fever, but peak viral RNA levels were identified in only 16 subjects. We conclude that this quantitative RT-PCR method will be valuable for further studies of natural DV infections.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1152B3P6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation's literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel's findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today's population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — definition, epidemiology, and interim management are outlined as follows: Acute HCV infection is arbitrarily defined as the first 6 months of infection, with jaundice in a minority of patients (< 25%). In the United States, the CDC estimates that 44,300 acute HCV infections occurred in 2017 with the upper limit of the confidence interval being 151,000 cases, and an estimated 75% of persons acutely infected with HCV progress to chronic infection. Treatment as prevention has been observed in cohorts of HIV-positive men who have sex with men when unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in acute HCV infections. In the interim, current guidance is to treat with regimens and durations as recommended for chronic HCV infection until additional data on abbreviated treatment regimens become available.

### A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [^114vACJz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Understanding the specific antibody profile and immune response in COVID-19 patients is critical for characterizing the progression of the disease, identifying patients with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic or have delayed symptom onset, and predicting potential long-term immunity. COVID-19-positive patients have undetectable antibody levels in the early stages of infection. Liu et al. (2020) and others found that IgM antibodies were detected 4 days after symptom onset in COVID-19-positive patients and declined to undetectable levels after 4 weeks. IgG antibodies reached detectable levels 7 days after infection, peaked around 25 days, and remained highly elevated after 4 weeks. Another recent study of 173 COVID-19-positive patients showed that the median seroconversion times for IgM and IgG were 11 days and 14 days post-infection, respectively. IgM levels began to decline after 5 weeks and were below detection limits after 7 weeks. IgG was highly elevated 7 weeks post-infection. Given their long half-lives, IgG antibodies may remain above detectable thresholds for months or years after infection. While some longitudinal studies have characterized the antibody response of COVID-19-positive patients and health-care workers, it is still unknown how long IgG may remain elevated after symptoms have subsided and what implications sustained IgG levels have on long-term immunological memory. Virus-specific IgM and IgA antibodies for SARS-CoV-1, which shares much of its genome with SARS-CoV-2, are similarly elevated in the serum of infected patients 6–8 days past symptom onset and begin to decline after 3–4 weeks. Importantly, IgG titers in SARS-CoV-1 infected patients are elevated 8 weeks post-infection and remain elevated for up to 2 years which may indicate the presence of long-term immunity.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115tnwmD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — assay selection, timing, and indications are summarized as follows: Wherever possible, serologic assays with established high sensitivity and specificity (eg, ≥ 99.5%) should be employed. IgG, IgG/IgM, and total antibody tests appear to have better sensitivity and specificity than other immunoglobulin classes and perform best when used between 3 to 5 weeks after symptom onset; testing should not be done during the first 2 weeks of symptoms because antibody production is often not detectable until week 3 or later, and few data are available after 8 weeks of symptoms. IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibody assays are suggested over an IgM assay. The clinical indications for antibody testing to support a diagnosis of COVID-19 are limited, and the panel identified only 1 clinical situation in which antibody testing is recommended: to assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize administration of monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. The current high seroprevalence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reduces the value of antibody testing for epidemiologic purposes, and although higher antibody titers and presence of neutralizing antibodies correlate with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a correlate of immune protection from infection has not been defined.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — trial scope and populations — Eighteen of those randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported on hospitalized patients, two RCTs on immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and three RCTs on ambulatory persons with mild COVID-19 disease; overall, eighteen trials randomized 17,232 hospitalized patients to receive COVID-19 convalescent plasma, several trials were open-label and/or had concerns with risk of bias, and timing of receipt varied across studies. One trial reported on 160 persons who received high-titer convalescent plasma less than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (mean age: 77.2 years; standard deviation: ± 8.6 years), and safety outcomes were reported for over 20,000 patients enrolled in the convalescent plasma EAP.

### Serologic assessment of the risk of developing chronic Q fever in cohorts of acutely infected individuals [^113uQ4Bq]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of serological profiles suggestive of chronic Q fever after acute infection.

Methods

A prospective follow-up study consisting of two separate cohorts was conducted to monitor the serological evolution of Q fever. The first cohort comprised subjects with acute Q fever diagnosed in 2004–2007 and the second enrolled subjects whose infection occurred in 2009. The indirect immunofluorescence assay was used for serological monitoring, with serum PCR testing added for subjects whose serological profiles revealed high titers of anti-phase I IgG ≥ 800, titers suggestive of chronic Q fever.

Results

In the first cohort of 92 persons, seventeen (18%) subjects had serological profiles suggestive of chronic Q fever (titers of anti-phase I IgG: 1280–5120, median: 1280) after a median follow-up period of 606.5 days. After a further follow-up (median period: 592 days) exclusively for those seventeen subjects, serological resolution with fourfold decrease of titers of anti-phase I IgG was noted in five of them. In the second cohort, only one (4%) of the twenty-eight subjects had high levels of anti-phase I IgG 180 days after acute infection. All the eighteen subjects with high levels of anti-phase I IgG were asymptomatic and had negative serum PCR testing. The different prevalence of subjects with high titers of anti-phase I IgG in the two cohorts was associated with duration of follow-up period (P < .01).

Conclusions

Subjects with high titers of anti-phase I IgG ≥ 800 was not uncommon and might not be detected until more than six months after acute Q fever infection. Asymptomatic subjects with high levels of anti-phase I IgG alone should not be treated as chronic Q fever and might not need continued serological monitoring in the absence of predisposing factors to chronic Q fever.

Median Cytokine Concentrations in the Noninfected, Acutely Infected, and Chronically Infected Pregnant Women, and Adjusted P Values for Each Pairwise Comparison

When looking more closely at the cytokine levels during acute infection, we regularly noticed a great variability of values, and often 2 or more distinct populations. Therefore, we dissected the evolution of infection during this phase using IgG titers as a marker. The results are shown in Figure 2, with cytokines displayed in the same groups as in Figure 1. Obviously, for most of the immune mediators with lower concentrations in chronically infected than in acutely infected patients, we observed a significant negative correlation between IgG levels and cytokine concentrations, regardless of whether concentrations were higher in acute compared to noninfected patient groups (IFN-γ, IL-12p70, CSF2, IFN-β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-15; Figure 2 A) or not (TNF-α, IL-17A, CSF3, and Il-1β; Figure 2 B). For those cytokines that remained elevated in the chronic phase, no correlation with IgG levels was noted (Figure 2 C). This lack of correlation was also observed for mediators whose levels did not differ between the 3 infection groups (Supplementary Figure 2 B). Thus, most cytokines that were temporarily upregulated during acute infections showed their highest concentrations early in the infectious process, followed by a rapid decline to the levels observed in the chronic phase.

Viral syndromes — laboratory testing principles note that many molecular assays for viral pathogens are laboratory developed tests (LDTs) offered by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories, and although LDTs require validation according to CLIA requirements prior to clinical use, performance may vary between laboratories. Throughout this section, the acronym NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) generally refers to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. Although the results of molecular assays offer strong laboratory evidence for the presence or absence of a viral agent, serologic tests may not be as conclusive, and detection of IgM-class antibodies may be associated with false positive results. Therefore, if the pretest probability of acute infection is low to moderate, it is good practice to measure IgG (or total IgG and IgM) antibodies at the time of presentation (acute phase) and 2–3 weeks later (convalescent phase) or to demonstrate a 4-fold or greater rise in antibody titers. Additional key points include that viral syndromes should be considered based on the patient's age, immune status, exposure and vaccination history, and many other variables; sample collection and handling are essential, with consultation to determine which specimens should be obtained and how to transport them to the laboratory; many laboratories will not have broad virologic testing capabilities, requiring external referral and resulting in longer turnaround times; antibody cross-reactivity among some closely related viral agents may result in non-specific serologic results; and tests for immunity, previous viral infection, and new infections may have different assay formats even when the same virus is being evaluated.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) diagnosis — Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis for LCMV infection and is typically established by demonstrating a 4-fold or greater increase in IgG-class antibody titers between acute and convalescent phase serum samples or by detection of anti-LCMV IgM antibodies. Detection of antibodies in the CSF may indicate CNS infection; however, it may also be observed if the CSF fluid becomes contaminated with blood during collection, or if there is transfer of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. NAAT can also be used to diagnose LCMV infection but is limited to select public health laboratories.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in HIV care — screening and confirmatory testing states that on entry into HIV care, all HIV-infected patients should undergo routine HCV screening, and initial testing should use the most sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood; for at risk HCV-seronegative individuals, HCV antibody testing is recommended annually or as indicated by risk exposure; false-negative anti-HCV antibody results are uncommon (< 1%) in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, and following acute HCV infection the window period prior to seroconversion ranges from 2 weeks to 12 weeks; elevated ALT early in acute infection should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in at-risk individuals; individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo confirmatory testing using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level; plasma HCV RNA viral load does not correlate with HCV disease severity and should not be monitored serially in patients not taking HCV treatment, but plasma HCV RNA levels provide important prognostic information about the likelihood of response to HCV treatment.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^113aCera]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — diagnostic accuracy within the first 2 weeks after symptom onset is based on 11 studies comparing serology with reverse transcription PCR, with included sample sizes for sensitivity analyses ranging from 1137 to 5161 and for specificity analyses from 4388 to 22,321; pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 99%. At 1 week after symptom onset, pooled sensitivity was 27% for IgM and 24% for IgG, and at 2 weeks it was 64% for IgM and 66% for IgG; although IgM responses often occur earlier for infections in general, with SARS-CoV-2 there does not appear to be a substantial difference in detection timing between IgM and IgG. If performed within 14 days of symptom onset, low sensitivity can yield many falsely negative results, and despite calculated specificity of 98%–99%, low-specificity assays can produce false-positive results for recent infection leading to incorrect conclusions and unnecessary actions. Serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

IDSA serologic testing — new recommendations on prior infection evidence and routine testing after infection/vaccination: The current guideline includes 2 new recommendations, comprising a weak recommendation to use serology assays that target nucleocapsid protein rather than spike protein when evidence of prior COVID-19 is desired and a recommendation that suggests against routine serologic testing in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The rationale notes that most available vaccines result in formation of anti-spike antibodies, some inactivated whole virus vaccines can also result in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and a single protective titer was not identified despite associations of higher binding or neutralizing antibodies with protection.

### The diagnostic utility of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity in distinguishing between past and acute infection of west nile virus (WNV) [^111Wp92W]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Global warming, increased travel, and population expansion into new previously uninhabited areas have resulted in the emergence of zoonotic pathogens in countries all over the world. As such, WNV circulation is constantly spreading and currently encompasses most of North America, Europe, and the Middle East. In Israel, WNV outbreaks are frequent and in 2024 resulted in 934 cases, most with significant neurological symptoms. Due to the short and low-level viremia, serology is the primary tool for WNV diagnosis with the presence of IgM antibodies specific to WNV indicative of acute infection. Unfortunately, several studies and real-world experience revealed that WNV-specific IgM antibodies may persist for months and even years after initial infection, thus complicating the diagnosis of acute WNV infection based on the presence of IgM alone. In this study, we found that IgG avidity may be used to aid in WNV diagnosis. Using a well-defined cohort of acute and past-infected WNV cases, we were able to demonstrate that IgG avidity accurately identifies previously infected individuals but is less conclusive for detecting acute infection.

A few studies have previously evaluated IgG avidity levels following WNV infection and demonstrated that IgG avidity levels are positively correlated with time since symptoms onset or positive RT-PCR for WNV RNA. However, due to the limited past-infection cohorts used, only a few of the samples tested for IgG avidity originated from older WNV convalescence samples or were clinical samples. Here, 187 samples, 103 convalescent and 84 acute samples from clinical samples were characterized based on the WNV diagnostic criteria and were confirmed as acute and convalescent real-world samples. Similarly to other studies, average avidity results from acute samples were low (26%; 95% CI: 21–30) and from past infected samples were high (63%; 95% CI: 59–67) (Fig. 1). However, the wide distribution of avidity levels, especially among samples characterized as past infection, suggested that further analysis is required in order to determine the diagnostic utility of IgG avidity.

TBEV EDIII- and NS1-specific antibody titers years after acute illness correlate with mild acute disease

We also investigated to what extent disease severity shortly after infection influenced the long-term immunological outcome of infection. Unvaccinated patients with mild TBE maintained significantly higher titers of TBEV EDIII- or NS1-specific antibodies than patients who suffered from more severe disease (Supplementary Fig. 1 A, B). Likewise, patients with meningoencephalomyelitis, the most severe clinical manifestation of TBE, had relatively lower TBEV EDIII-specific antibody titers than patients who had meningitis only (Supplementary Fig. 1A). These disease severity-associated differences were not observed for virus-specific IgG antibody and VN antibody titers (Supplementary Fig. 1 C, D). We also compared the antibody levels in the convalescent samples with the long-term outcome of the TBEV infections. Relatively low TBEV-specific IgG, EDIII, and NS1 antibody levels were observed in patients with objective neurological sequelae, although the difference with patients that had a more favorable disease outcome was not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. 1 A– C).

### Evaluation of acute and convalescent antibody concentration against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides for the diagnosis of pneumococcal infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^113nmF1X]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Modeling of data from randomized controlled trials has suggested that approximately one-third of children with pneumonia and radiographic consolidation have pneumococcal infection in settings without routine infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV). However, microbiologic techniques have limited accuracy to diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia for individual patients due to the inaccessibility of lung for sampling, pretreatment with antibiotics and prevalent nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of pneumococci in healthy children. Paired acute and convalescent serology to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (PS)or proteinsfrom children with pneumococcal pneumonia may have diagnostic utility for pneumococcal pneumonia, but previous studies either do not use controls from the same disease population and/or use arbitrary thresholds for defining a positive result. We evaluated the accuracy of serology to pneumococcal PS for the diagnosis of pneumococcal infection in children hospitalized with pneumonia in Kathmandu, Nepal during 2015–2017. Ten-valent PCV (Synflorix, GSK) was introduced in the Nepal infant immunization schedule in 2015, with no catch-up campaign. In children hospitalized with pneumonia in this setting, 73% and 78% of invasive pneumococcal disease isolates were of serotypes covered by 10-valent PCV during 2005–2013 before 10-valent PCV introduction, and NP carriage of any pneumococci was 36% and of pneumococcal serotypes within 10-valent PCV was 14% during 2014–2015.

### Update on north American tick-borne diseases and how to diagnose them [^112ibqEC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serology

Serologic testing has been a longstanding approach for the diagnosis of TBDs; however, with the development and increasing availability of NAATs, serology is no longer the preferred method for detection of acute disease caused by a number of these pathogens. Multiple limitations associated with serologic testing have been described, regardless of targeted antibody class, including prolonged time to seroconversion, which often occurs beyond the acute phase of disease. Studies assessing the kinetics of IgM/IgG antibody development against A. phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia species, and Babesia species generally show seroconversion occurring 7 to 14 days after symptom onset, limiting the clinical utility of this approach in patients presenting with acute disease. As a result of this inherent biologic delay, reliance on a positive IgM result to diagnose acute infection due to either of these tick-borne agents is generally not recommended; instead, a NAAT performed on whole blood should be ordered for patients presenting with acute disease. While some patients may exhibit high pathogen-specific IgG titers (≥ 1:640) early in disease onset, which would be consistent with a presumptive diagnosis, the majority of acutely ill patients who are only tested for IgG-class antibodies result as IgG-seronegative or with a low-titer positive result (i.e. ≤ 1:128). In the latter two scenarios, repeat testing on a convalescent sample collected in 2–3 weeks is necessary to either definitively rule out (i.e. IgG remains negative) or establish (i.e. document a fourfold or higher change in titers) a diagnosis. Due to the need for convalescent sample collection, however, this is considered a retrospective diagnostic approach and not ideal for acute patient care. Result interpretation for IgG-class antibodies is further complicated by the issue of antibody persistence, which can range from months to years following disease resolution. As a result, convalescent testing of initially seropositive patients is important to determine whether detectable IgG is due to prior (< 4-fold change in titers) or recent (≥ 4-fold change in titers) disease. Finally, serologic assays for detection of antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia, and Babesia species suffer from challenges associated with specificity, including both the potential for false-positive results due to cross-reactivity between closely related species (A. phagocytophilum, E. chaffeensis, Coxiella burnetii, rickettsial species, etc.) and due to the risk of false-negative results as a result of limited cross-reactivity within a genus. The latter is particularly problematic for Babesia species, as commercially available assays are typically designed using B. microti whole organism or antigens, which do not share significant homology with other endemic Babesia species, including B. duncani and B. divergens; this limited cross-reactivity may potentially lead to missed diagnoses if serology is the sole diagnostic method employed.

### Differences in antibody kinetics and functionality between severe and mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections [^112E8rJD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We determined and compared the humoral immune response in patients with severe (hospitalized) and mild (nonhospitalized) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with severe disease (n = 38) develop a robust antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies. The geometric mean 50% virus neutralization titer is 1:240. SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in hospital personnel (n = 24), who developed mild symptoms necessitating leave of absence and self-isolation, but not hospitalization; 75% developed antibodies, but with low/absent virus neutralization (60% with titers < 1:20). While severe COVID-19 patients develop a strong antibody response, mild SARS-CoV-2 infections induce a modest antibody response. Long-term monitoring will show whether these responses predict protection against future infections.

### Contribution of limited molecular testing to low ehrlichiosis diagnosis in high incidence area, north carolina, USA [^116aS83L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Whereas empirical antimicrobial drug treatment is recommended when there is a reasonable pretest probability of ehrlichiosis, the relatively fast turnaround of PCR, at least compared with paired serologic testing, offers a timely and objective result to confirm the diagnosis, thereby providing valuable information to both the patient and provider regarding the cause of illness. In our cohort, the number of patients for whom testing was ordered but were not empirically treated with doxycycline is concerning. Because the providers believed there was sufficient evidence to order an ehrlichiosis test, they also should have provided empirical treatment to patients. Without a convalescent blood test, an acute titer result cannot be used to either confirm or rule out ehrlichiosis. Positive PCR results can offer timelier confirmation of ehrlichiosis confirmation and subsequently ensure an appropriate treatment plan. Whereas treatment is ideally prescribed with clinical suspicion, findings show that this is not always the case, and a positive PCR may prompt more immediate action if otherwise not taken. Moreover, because convalescent testing has a much higher positivity rate than acute testing (61.7% vs. 27.0%) but most patients who receive a negative acute IgG titer fail to return for a convalescent titer, there are likely patients with ehrlichiosis who go undetected. Differing titer values in more than half of paired acute and convalescent samples indicate the convalescent test is clearly needed to interpret serologic results accurately, consistent with current guidelines. The relatively large proportion of paired titers of the same value implies prior infection and reinforces the importance of paired serologic specimens in areas where baseline seroprevalence is high.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to serology, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies 3–5 weeks after symptom onset when evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired. Avoid obtaining SARS-CoV-2 IgM alone for this purpose.

### Longitudinal changes in antibody titers in a nursing home in which COVID-19 clusters occurred [^114cZGYL]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Many outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 have occurred in Japanese nursing homes in which residents and staff are in close daily contact. This study evaluated longitudinal changes in antibody titers in nursing homes in which clusters occurred and examined the association between antibody titer and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or severity.

Methods

This cohort study included 171 participants who had provided at least one antibody titer test between June 2022 and March 2023. A descriptive analysis estimated the association between the risk of infection and antibody titer level.

Results

The facility experienced 2 clusters during the study period that involved facility staff as the initial source of infection. Noninfected participants had less variation in antibody titer levels and a higher level of preinfection antibodies than infected participants. The risk of infection and severity was lower in participants with higher antibody titers than in those with lower titers.

Conclusions

We showed the changes in antibody titers over time and the association between antibody titer and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or severity. Vaccination schedules may need to be tailored to the dynamics of decreasing antibody titers over time and the occurrence of infectious diseases in facilities.

### Kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response to respiratory syncytial virus infections in a birth cohort [^1168dw4q]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 2
The mean neutralizing antibody titer (open circles with corresponding 95% confidence intervals) in the pre-exposure control is compared to the mean titer in sera collected within 10 days of identification of both primary and secondary infecting virus. Mean titers at the primary and secondary infection stage are also compared. Comparison is also made between the mean acute titers at the secondary infection stage and cord titers. The lines connecting the different groups being compared indicate whether differences in mean titer are statistically significant.

The first 6–8 months of life were characterized by a decline in maternally derived neutralizing antibodies against a background of increased population-level virus transmission (Fig. 3). Increased virus transmission in the second epidemic coincided with significant increases in the cohort-level titers of both phase 1 (P = 0.003) and 2 (P = 0.025) as shown in Figure 3 and correspondingly, the decline in population-level virus transmission was associated with a significant decline in cohort-level titers in phase 1 (P = 0.03) but not phase 2 (P = 0.2). Increased virus transmission in the third epidemic was also associated with significant increases in cohort-level titers in cohort phases 1and 2 (P < 0.0001).

Figure 3
The relationship between cohort-level neutralizing antibody dynamics and population-level virus transmission was determined by overlaying mean neutralizing titers in successive three calendar month strata within phase 1 (top panel) and phase 2 (bottom panel) of the birth cohort onto RSV weekly case data identified through pediatric pneumonia surveillance at Kilifi district hospital. The open circles and corresponding whiskers indicate the mean titer within a particular stratum and 95% confidence intervals. The numbers above each stratum indicate the mean age and the total number of samples tested in that stratum. The vertical bars indicate weekly admission totals of infants admitted with RSV related pneumonia over the surveillance period (right axis). The graduated line at the bottom of the RSV incidence bars indicates stratum boundaries. The P -values above the gray lines connecting different strata indicate whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean titers of the groups being compared. Asterix symbols (*) indicate the strata that were considered to have the highest mean titers (peak titers) following an epidemic.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115WUsZ9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offers low clinical benefit with very low-certainty evidence; reported positivity varied widely (IgM or IgG 11% to 62%; PCR-negative/total antibody-positive 0% to 60%), studies varied by assay and timing (eg, < 20 days vs > 15 days), and in unvaccinated or previously uninfected individuals the negative predictive value is high when testing is performed more than 2 weeks after symptom onset. In this instance, negative serologic results should prompt further evaluation for alternative etiologies if symptoms persist. Serology cannot distinguish recent from remote infection or vaccine response from infection, and assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides no added benefit over repeat NAATs for diagnosing acute COVID-19 and may lead to diagnostic uncertainty.

Mumps — serology-based diagnosis, timing, and when to confirm by virologic testing: Although considered eliminated in the United States, the mumps vaccine "has a protective rate of ~88% following administration of the 2 doses". Immunity is "suggested by the presence of anti-mumps IgG-class antibodies", and diagnosis can be supported by "a positive serologic test for anti-mumps IgM antibodies and/or seroconversion or a 4-fold rise of mumps IgG antibody levels between acute and convalescent phase sera". For timing, "acute phase sera should be collected immediately… and convalescent sera collected approximately 5–10 days thereafter", with IgM that "peak approximately 1 week post onset". Quantitative or semi-quantitative mumps IgG testing "is no longer routinely available" locally, and "previously immunized patients… may not develop a detectable IgM response", so confirmation "requires isolation of the virus itself or detection of viral RNA", tests "largely limited to public health laboratories and the CDC".

Rubella serologic diagnosis and timing — acute infection can be serologically confirmed by documenting seroconversion to IgM and/or IgG positivity or a 4-fold rise in anti-rubella IgG between acute and convalescent sera; only approximately 50% of patients are IgM positive at rash onset, so acute phase serum should be collected upon presentation and again 14–21 days (minimum of 7 days) later. Due to the rarity in the United States and the thus low pre-test probability of infection, serologic evaluation should only be performed in patients with appropriate exposures risks and a clinical presentation highly suggestive of acute rubella; in patients not meeting these criteria, positive rubella IgM results should be interpreted with caution as they may be falsely positive.

### Investigation and long-term monitoring of the presence of neutralizing antibody in patients with COVID-19 disease of different clinical severity [^113UxmFq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Understanding the immune responses elicited by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is critical to public health policy and vaccine development and prevention of reinfections for COVID-19. It is important to know the neutralizing capacity of antibodies and to monitor their persistence. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into four groups (severe-critical, moderate, mild, and asymptomatic) according to their clinical severity. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike viral surface protein were investigated by ELISA method 3 and 9 months after the onset of the disease. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) response was evaluated by microneutralization test. Patients who received at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine after illness were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and NAb titers were shown to be strongly correlated with disease severity. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NAb levels were found to be compatible with each other. After 9 months of follow-up, both IgG and NAb levels continued unabated in individuals who had the disease. In individuals who received at least two doses of the vaccine, these levels increased, except for severe-critical patients. High levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG are indicative, as it is difficult to investigate NAb in routine laboratories. At the same time, it can be predicted that this period may be much longer if it continues for at least 9 months and is reinforced with vaccination.

Initially, we characterized serum samples from convalescent individuals (Figure 1). Antibodies induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection typically display low avidity against the spike and against internal proteins of the virus. To analyze in detail the antibody levels and avidity induced after infection using serum samples from the convalescent group, we stratified samples based on their initial IgG anti-spike antibody response measured before the current study in a Mount Sinai's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory, as described elsewhere. Titers of 1:80 and 1:160 were categorized as low (+), 1:320 as moderate (++), and 1:960 and ≥ 1:2880 as high (+++).

Schematic representation of the groups with different exposure histories used in the study. Viral particles depicted in the left side indicate prior infection (by ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains); those depicted in the right side, breakthrough infection (by Omicron BA.1). The number and sequence of vaccinations are indicated by syringes; the serum collection time points, by blood tubes. The intervals (days) between vaccination or breakthrough infection and sample collection are given as mean (range) ± standard deviation. Further details are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Abbreviations: 2× and 3×, 2 or 3 vaccine doses; NA, not available.

Importantly, IgM and IgA antibody isotypes were correlated well with IgG titers (Figure 2 A) and this was consistent with binding assessed using the SeroKlir commercial RBD-Spike ELISA from Kantaro Biosciences, as reported elsewhere (Figure 2 B). However, neutralization titers against USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2, indicated by the inhibitory dilution 50% (ID 50), were low in most serum samples (ID 50, < 100) and moderate (ID 50, 100–200) in those with the highest binding titers (Figure 2 C). Of note, the IgG antibody levels measured with the SeroKlir assay and neutralization titers showed a good correlation with IgG measured using our SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding IgG in-house ELISA (Figure 2 A –2 C) and were moderately correlated with IgM and IgA (Supplementary Figure 1).

### Magnitude and kinetics of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody responses and their relationship to disease severity [^114uC7a3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response. For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets.

Methods

Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity.

Results

Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG.

Conclusions

High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.

### A longitudinal study of COVID-19 sequelae and immunity: baseline findings [^111EYNXG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of persons who develop COVID-19 report persistent symptoms after acute illness. Various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

Objective

To characterize medical sequelae and persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 in a cohort of disease survivors and controls.

Design

Cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04411147).

Setting

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.

Participants

Self-referred adults with laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who were at least 6 weeks from symptom onset were enrolled regardless of presence of PASC. A control group comprised persons with no history of COVID-19 or serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited regardless of their current health status. Both groups were enrolled over the same period and from the same geographic area.

Measurements

All participants had the same evaluations regardless of presence of symptoms, including physical examination, laboratory tests and questionnaires, cognitive function testing, and cardiopulmonary evaluation. A subset also underwent exploratory immunologic and virologic evaluations.

Results

189 persons with laboratory-documented COVID-19 (12% of whom were hospitalized during acute illness) and 120 antibody-negative control participants were enrolled. At enrollment, symptoms consistent with PASC were reported by 55% of the COVID-19 cohort and 13% of control participants. Increased risk for PASC was noted in women and those with a history of anxiety disorder. Participants with findings meeting the definition of PASC reported lower quality of life on standardized testing. Abnormal findings on physical examination and diagnostic testing were uncommon. Neutralizing antibody levels to spike protein were negative in 27% of the unvaccinated COVID-19 cohort and none of the vaccinated COVID-19 cohort. Exploratory studies found no evidence of persistent viral infection, autoimmunity, or abnormal immune activation in participants with PASC.

Limitations

Most participants with COVID-19 had mild to moderate acute illness that did not require hospitalization. The prevalence of reported PASC was likely overestimated in this cohort because persons with PASC may have been more motivated to enroll. The study did not capture PASC that resolved before enrollment.

Conclusion

A high burden of persistent symptoms was observed in persons after COVID-19. Extensive diagnostic evaluation revealed no specific cause of reported symptoms in most cases. Antibody levels were highly variable after COVID-19.

### Neutralizing antibody titres in SARS-CoV-2 infections [^115TTyMc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Limitations of our study are that we have few sera beyond 200 days after onset of symptoms to define the late antibody waning kinetics. We also have relatively fewer numbers of asymptomatic infections (n = 31) compared to those with mild disease (n = 151). Thus, our findings on asymptomatic infections need to be interpreted with caution. Since the focus of our study was the kinetics of neutralizing antibody, we did not carry out titrations to define the end-points in our spike RBD ELISA IgG antibody assays; our data being OD values at a single serum dilution (1/100).

In summary, our findings of neutralizing antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infections are comparable to what is observed with SARS and other some other viral infections. It is likely that neutralizing antibody will be maintained over the first year after mild or severe disease with higher antibody titers and longer duration of detectable antibody in those with severe disease. It is important to note that even once neutralizing antibody levels have dropped below the detectable threshold, that immune memory will lead to rapid anamnestic antibody responses following re-exposure to the virus, and these are likely to be protective against severe disease. It is also noted that antibody may not confer sterilizing immunity but may prevent from reinfection leading to severe disease. A recent case of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a person, who failed to develop neutralizing antibody following his first infection is relevant in this regard. Investigation of further cases of reinfection in regard to immune responses and onward transmission will be revealing.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^113owNSV]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV infection laboratory staging — definitions are provided as follows: the eclipse period is the initial interval when no laboratory markers are consistently detectable; the seroconversion window period is the interval between infection and the first detection of antibodies, with duration depending on immunoassay design and sensitivity; acute HIV infection is the interval between appearance of detectable HIV RNA and first detection of antibodies, with duration also dependent on immunoassay design and sensitivity; established HIV infection is characterized by a fully developed IgG response sufficient for a positive Western blot or IFA.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^114DPnYa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical pathway

Broadly speaking, there are four considered uses of antibody tests.

In diagnosis of acute suspected COVID‐19 in patients who presented with symptoms, particularly where molecular testing had failed to detect the virus.
In assessment of immune response in patients with severe disease.
For individuals to assess whether they have had a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and have an immune response.
In seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes.

For 1, the standard approach to diagnosis of COVID‐19 is through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test, which detects the presence of virus in swab samples taken from nose, throat or fluid from the lungs. However, the test is known to give false negative results, and can only detect COVID‐19 in the acute phase of the illness. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the China CDC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China), have produced case definitions for COVID‐19 that include RT‐PCR‐negative cases that display other convincing clinical evidence (Appendix 1). The most recent case definition from the China CDC includes positive serology tests. Confirming an acute clinical diagnosis using a serology test requires detectable virus‐specific IgM and IgG in serum, or detectable virus‐specific IgG, or a 4‐fold or greater increase in titration to be observed during convalescence compared with the acute phase.

For 2, this is largely a question of monitoring patients, and we will not cover this in this review. Assessment of the accuracy of a test used for assessment of immune response would involve comparison with a reference standard test of antibody response, rather than evidence of infection.

Use 3 involves testing individuals during periods of convalescence (after symptoms have resolved) whereas 4 will involve testing people at a mixture of time points, including long follow‐up. A key difference between 3 and 4 is the likelihood of disease, which is expected to be much higher for 3 than 4.

An extended version of use case scenarios is available in Appendix 2.

Prior test(s)

Prior testing depends on the purpose of the test. For 1 we would anticipate that patients were symptomatic and had most likely undergone RT‐PCR testing and possible computed tomography (CT) imaging. Uses 3 and 4 will most likely include people who have not been tested, and may include people who are asymptomatic as well as symptomatic.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for Q fever… [^115nMsW8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended tests The reference standard test for the serologic diagnosis of acute Q fever is the indirect fluorescent antibody test using C. burnetii antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 3 to 6 weeks later. In most Q fever cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or "negative, " and the second typically shows a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody levels. A negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out Q fever as a cause of illness. There are two distinct antigenic phases to which humans develop antibody responses. In acute infection, an antibody response to. C.

burnetii phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than antibody levels to phase I antigen; the reverse is true in chronic infection which is associated with a rising phase I IgG titer that may be higher than phase II IgG. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG, near the end of the first week of illness, and remain elevated for months or longer and therefore provide limited diagnostic value on their own. IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request concurrent IgG titers. If only one sample is tested, it can be difficult to interpret the findings. Paired samples taken 3 to 6 weeks apart demonstrating fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of acute Q fever.

During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction assay to determine if a patient has Q fever. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness before the appearance of. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever Chronic Q fever is confirmed by elevated phase I IgG antibody ≥ 1: 1024 and an identifiable persistent focus of infection. Whole blood, serum or tissue biopsies may be tested by PCR for C. burnetii. PCR of whole blood has low sensitivity in patients with chronic Q fever endocarditis, so serum antibody titers should also be tested.

### Detection of antibodies-DPDx-serum / plasma specimens… [^111ao95A]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum/Plasma Specimens – Detection of Antibodies – General Information Diagnosis of parasitic infections is definitively made by identification of parasites in host tissue or excreta. Such identification is not generally possible in diseases such as toxoplasmosis or toxocariasis, in which parasites are located in deep tissue sites, and is not initially recommended in diseases such as cysticercosis or echinococcosis, in which invasive techniques with some risk to the patient are necessary to obtain material. In general, detection of antibodies to parasitic diseases indicates only infection at some indeterminate time and not necessarily acute or current infection. Levels of antibodies to parasites slowly decline after the patient is cured of the infection but generally last for at least six months to many years, depending on the infecting parasite, and thus are not generally useful, real-time indicators of successful cure.

The detection of specific IgM and IgA antibodies may be of value in determining the approximate time of initial infection with. Toxoplasma gondii, but is not recommended for any other parasitic disease. If infection with a parasite is suspected and blood film, stool or urine examinations are either not indicated or are negative, then the appropriate serology test for specific IgG antibodies should be requested. Tests for parasite-specific IgM, IgA, or IgE are generally not useful for diagnosis and should not be requested. If the parasite-specific IgG is negative, a positive IgM, IgA, or IgE result is generally a false-positive reaction and should not be considered when determining patient management. For most parasitic diseases, the antigen is generally the assay component which has the most influence on test sensitivity and specificity. Parasites generally have more than one life cycle stage which may have both mutually shared antigens and stage-specific antigens.

The matrix to which antigens are bound for use in a specific procedure also physically selects for which antigen subset will be available for antibody binding. Specimens from well-defined clinical cases are acceptable for assay evaluations of these diseases, but are usually difficult to obtain. The patient specimens should be characterized to suit the particular disease. Sensitivity of a procedure may be affected by the stage and type of the patient's disease. For example, patients who have undergone surgery for an echinococcal cyst in the liver almost always will have detectable antibodies, but may have been negative prior to surgery.

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for west nile virus disease… [^115HBWWy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Patients with suspected West Nile virus disease should first be tested for WNV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid.
- In some cases, positive IgM results should be confirmed by neutralizing antibody testing at a state public health laboratory or CDC.
- Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction should be considered in patients with immunocompromising conditions. WNV-specific IgM antibodies are usually detectable 3 to 8 days after onset of illness and persist for 30 to 90 days, but longer persistence has been documented. Therefore, positive IgM antibodies occasionally may reflect a past infection. If serum is collected within 8 days of illness onset, the absence of detectable virus-specific IgM does not rule out the diagnosis of WNV infection, and the test may need to be repeated on a later sample.

The presence of WNV-specific IgM in serum or CSF provides good evidence of recent infection but may also result from cross-reactive antibodies after infection with other flaviviruses or from non-specific reactivity. Therefore, in certain situations, positive results obtained with these assays should be confirmed by neutralizing antibody testing at a state public health laboratory or CDC. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests can help determine the specific infecting flavivirus. PRNTs can also confirm acute infection by demonstrating a fourfold or greater change in WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titer between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples collected 2 to 3 weeks apart. Indications for confirmatory testing by PRNT:
- Possible exposure to cross-reactive flaviviruses
- Atypical or unusually severe presentation or death
- Suspected unusual route of transmission
- Presentation outside of the typical arboviral season. WNV IgG antibodies generally are detected shortly after IgM antibodies and persist for many years following a symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Therefore, the presence of IgG antibodies alone is only evidence of previous infection and clinically compatible cases with the presence of IgG, but not IgM, should be evaluated for other etiologic agents.

### Laboratory testing for epstein… [^112u1vZZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of tests Viral capsid antigen Anti-VCA IgM appears early in EBV infection and usually disappears within four to six weeks. Anti-VCA IgG appears in the acute phase of EBV infection, peaks at 2 to 4 weeks after onset, declines slightly then persists for the rest of a person's life. Early antigen Anti-EA IgG appears in the acute phase of illness and generally falls to undetectable levels after three to six months. In many people, detection of antibody to EA is a sign of active infection. However, 20% of healthy people may have antibodies against EA for years. Virus detection If patient is ill for more than 6 months How to interpret tests The interpretation of EBV antibody tests requires familiarity with these tests and access to the patient's clinical information. Susceptibility to infection People are considered susceptible to EBV infection if they do not have antibodies to the VCA.

Primary infection People are considered to have a primary EBV infection if they have anti-VCA IgM but do not have antibody to EBNA. Other results that strongly suggest a primary infection are a high or rising level of anti-VCA IgG and no antibody to EBNA after at least 4 weeks of illness. Resolution of the illness may occur before the diagnostic antibody levels appear. In rare cases, people with active EBV infections may not have detectable EBV-specific antibodies. Past infection The presence of antibodies to both VCA and EBNA suggests past infection. Since over 90% of adults have been infected with EBV, most adults will show antibodies to EBV from infection years earlier. High or elevated antibody levels may be present for years and are not diagnostic of recent infection. Recent vs.

past infections Testing paired acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples is not useful to distinguish between recent and past EBV infections. In most cases, the antibody response occurs rapidly during primary EBV infection. The clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis occur in conjunction with the appearance of IgG and IgM anti-VCA antibodies. However, the antibody pattern is not stable before symptoms appear.
