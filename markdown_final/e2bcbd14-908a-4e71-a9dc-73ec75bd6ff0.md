## Question

Trabecular bone score.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the trabecular bone score (TBS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what TBS is and how it is generated from DXA. Then, I should verify what TBS actually measures and how it relates to bone microarchitecture. Next, I will assess the evidence that TBS predicts fractures independent of BMD and FRAX and note counterexamples. After that, I should clarify how to integrate TBS with FRAX and when it changes management. I will then consider key special populations where TBS is particularly informative. I need to review whether TBS is useful for monitoring therapy and what least significant change (LSC) applies. I should also double-check technical pitfalls, algorithm versions, and precision. Finally, I will consider interpretation thresholds, pediatric considerations, and provide a pragmatic clinical workflow while highlighting limitations and controversies [^115M99Tp] [^114K51MS] [^114EhJjh].

> Let me first confirm the definition and acquisition details: TBS is a gray-level textural metric computed from the standard anteroposterior lumbar spine DXA image, so no new scan is required; the same raw DXA data used for aBMD can be reanalyzed retrospectively with TBS software, which is why it is convenient to add to existing studies, and I need to ensure we note it is complementary to BMD rather than a replacement [^115M99Tp] [^114EhJjh] [^111Jw22r].

> I need to verify what TBS actually captures; TBS reflects the spatial distribution of pixel intensities in the 2-D projection and correlates with 3-D microarchitectural features and biomechanical competence measured by HR-pQCT and micro–finite element analysis, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because it remains an indirect index and should be interpreted in that context rather than as a direct measurement of trabecular number or thickness per se [^115M99Tp] [^116XKPSN].

> Next, I should review fracture prediction data; in a large meta-analysis across 14 prospective cohorts, each 1-SD decrease in TBS was associated with a higher major osteoporotic fracture risk even after adjustment for FRAX probability, supporting independent predictive value, but wait, I should double-check nuance because in some cohorts of older men the association of TBS with incident vertebral fractures attenuated after adjustment for lumbar spine BMD, which tempers the claim of independence in all settings and reminds me to consider site-specific adjustments and BMI effects when interpreting TBS [^114K51MS] [^113zFMwV] [^113Fuiw3].

> I will now examine how TBS integrates with FRAX; TBS can be used to adjust FRAX probabilities through the FRAXplus platform using a multiplicative adjustment, yet I should confirm that reclassification is usually modest overall and most impactful for patients near an intervention threshold, which means the clinical utility is greatest when the baseline probability or T-score is borderline; hold on, I initially thought the 2025 European DXA guideline was high-credibility, but I need to correct myself because here it is labeled low-credibility despite aligning with ISCD/ESCEO positions, so I will frame it accordingly [^114EhJjh] [^116Lak3Y] [^114K51MS].

> Let me consider specific populations where TBS may add value beyond BMD; I should confirm recommendations in men given ESCEO guidance to use TBS alongside BMD and FRAX, and I need to check the diabetes paradox where BMD can be higher yet TBS lower with persistent fracture risk, as well as CKD where lower TBS tracks higher fracture probability and hemodialysis cohorts show degraded microarchitecture; in glucocorticoid-treated patients, TBS seems to discriminate fracture status better than BMD; additionally, in settings like iron overload and pre-transplant evaluations, TBS often reveals abnormalities not captured by aBMD, but I should note that evidence strength varies across these conditions [^111VR2ML] [^113yMkvN] [^114dm1Cw] [^113MdQp8] [^114nrMbT] [^114FQuJF] [^111Jw22r] [^112CVgYP].

> Now, I need to check whether TBS is useful for monitoring therapy; change in TBS often lags the clear associations seen with BMD during antiresorptive therapy, and in a large registry, TBS change did not predict fractures in treated or untreated women, yet denosumab in de novo kidney transplant recipients increased TBS alongside BMD and romosozumab produced significant gains in tissue thickness–adjusted TBS with low correlation to BMD changes, while zoledronate produced small but statistically detectable TBS improvements over three years, so I should conclude that monitoring value depends on the agent and duration and is most compelling with anabolic therapy or long-term antiresorptives rather than with short-term bisphosphonates [^114omRsH] [^116XKPSN] [^116RkV8S] [^112bw9Gp] [^116Txnsi].

> Hold on, I should verify precision and LSC before recommending monitoring intervals; TBS reproducibility is lower than BMD with in vivo coefficients of variation around 1.9–2.0% and LSC approximately 5.2–5.4% across scan modes, and guidelines suggest calculating a center-specific TBS LSC or using a conservative 5.8% threshold, so I need to ensure any reported change exceeds LSC to avoid overinterpreting noise [^116jjCq1] [^114EhJjh].

> Next, I should review technical and algorithmic issues because they materially affect interpretation; earlier TBS algorithms adjusted for BMI, but updated versions adjust for regional soft tissue thickness and change correlations with anthropometrics and fracture prediction performance, and in pediatrics, using BMI-adjusted TBS with tissue-thickness–derived normative data will falsely elevate Z-scores, so I must confirm which algorithm version is used when comparing to reference ranges; moreover, higher waist circumference and trunk adiposity can degrade TBS estimates, underscoring the need to consider body habitus [^111dXVeH] [^114JFmuT] [^113ThF4M].

> I need to ensure appropriate thresholds and reporting; while many studies reference categorical cut points that classify "normal", "partially degraded", and "degraded" TBS, these bands can be population- and algorithm-specific as shown in Taiwanese data and pediatric reference efforts, and guidelines caution that normative datasets in children and some ethnicities remain limited, so I should verify that the chosen thresholds match the patient's ancestry, age, and the algorithm used, and I should also note that TBS T-scores may not vary by race/ethnicity in some high-risk cohorts even when DXA T-scores do [^116gZ31W] [^114EhJjh] [^112CVgYP].

> But wait, what about limitations and controversies; I need to acknowledge that biomechanical work using an early TBS definition (variogram initial slope) found little or no association with vertebral strength in most setups, reminding me that TBS is an indirect surrogate and not a direct strength measure, and I should also recognize that some systemic conditions like mild hyponatremia may reduce hip BMD without altering TBS, emphasizing that TBS complements but does not replace site-specific BMD and clinical risk factors [^112L8qLo] [^11373Nph].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and adolescent applications; reference ranges by age, sex, and ancestry now exist using a tissue thickness–adjusted algorithm, TBS tracks pubertal timing and increases during puberty, tracking over time is weaker than aBMD with higher precision error, and in pediatric conditions like cerebral palsy, TBS may be relatively independent of height while correlating only weakly with aBMD, so I should confirm algorithm compatibility and avoid applying adult thresholds to youth [^117F4Pbn] [^114JFmuT] [^1131WczJ].

> Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic workflow; when L1–L4 DXA is available, I will add TBS for adults ≥ 50 years or high-risk groups and interpret TBS alongside lumbar spine BMD and FRAX, then adjust FRAX via FRAXplus especially when the baseline probability is near an intervention threshold to see if classification changes; I need to check for soft tissue extremes and algorithm version, document the TBS LSC in the report, and reserve serial TBS monitoring for therapies likely to modify microarchitecture meaningfully (for example, romosozumab or prolonged denosumab), while avoiding overinterpretation of small within-LSC changes and always integrating clinical risk factors and imaging artifacts before making treatment decisions [^114EhJjh] [^116Lak3Y] [^116jjCq1] [^116RkV8S].

Trabecular bone score (TBS) [^115M99Tp] is a DXA-derived, grayscale texture index from lumbar spine images that provides an **indirect measure of trabecular microarchitecture** and predicts fracture risk independently of BMD [^114K51MS] [^113Fuiw3]. TBS is **complementary to BMD** and is recommended to be used with BMD and FRAX, especially near intervention thresholds [^114EhJjh] [^116Lak3Y] [^111VR2ML]. It is particularly useful in diabetes [^113yMkvN], glucocorticoid therapy [^114FQuJF], and secondary osteoporosis [^113MdQp8] [^1136GN7t], and can be applied retrospectively to existing DXA scans without extra radiation or scanning [^114EhJjh] [^111Jw22r]. TBS is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD [^116Txnsi], so **BMD remains primary for monitoring therapy** [^114omRsH].

---

## Definition and measurement

TBS is a gray-level texture metric derived from lumbar spine DXA [^115M99Tp] that reflects **trabecular microarchitecture** and provides information beyond BMD. Measurement: It is calculated from standard lumbar spine DXA images using specialized software (e.g. TBS iNsight) and requires **no additional scans or radiation** [^114EhJjh] [^111Jw22r].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Fracture risk prediction**: TBS predicts major osteoporotic and vertebral fractures [^113Fuiw3] independently of BMD and clinical risk factors [^114K51MS].

- **Complementary to BMD**: TBS adds value to BMD, especially in patients with normal or osteopenic BMD but degraded microarchitecture [^114K51MS] [^11716UsZ].

- **Integration with FRAX**: TBS-adjusted FRAX [^114K51MS] modestly improves fracture risk prediction and can reclassify patients near intervention thresholds [^116Lak3Y].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ISCD and ESCEO recommend using **TBS alongside BMD and FRAX** for fracture risk assessment, particularly near intervention thresholds [^114EhJjh]. The **ESCEO 2024 men's osteoporosis guideline** similarly recommends TBS with BMD and FRAX for risk assessment in men [^111VR2ML].

---

## Clinical applications

- **Diabetes mellitus**: TBS helps explain increased fracture risk in type 2 diabetes despite higher BMD [^113yMkvN] [^114dm1Cw].

- **Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis**: TBS improves fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid-treated patients [^114FQuJF].

- **Secondary osteoporosis**: TBS is useful in secondary osteoporosis, including chronic kidney disease [^113MdQp8] and hyperparathyroidism [^1136GN7t].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Technical factors**: TBS is influenced by BMI, soft tissue thickness, and imaging mode; updated algorithms adjust for these factors [^111dXVeH] [^114JFmuT].

- **Reproducibility**: TBS has lower reproducibility than BMD, with a higher least significant change (LSC) [^116jjCq1].

- **Therapy monitoring**: TBS is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD, so BMD remains primary for monitoring [^114omRsH] [^116Txnsi].

Trabecular bone score [^115M99Tp] is a DXA-derived index that reflects trabecular microarchitecture and predicts fracture risk independently of BMD [^114K51MS]. It is recommended to be used with BMD and FRAX, especially near intervention thresholds [^114EhJjh] [^116Lak3Y], and is particularly useful in diabetes [^113yMkvN], glucocorticoid therapy [^114FQuJF], and secondary osteoporosis [^113MdQp8]. TBS can be applied retrospectively to existing DXA scans without additional radiation or scanning [^114EhJjh] [^111Jw22r], but it is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD, so **BMD remains primary for monitoring therapy** [^116Txnsi] [^114omRsH].

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^114EhJjh]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

The ISCD Official Positions and a position paper from ESCEO provide information on trabecular bone score (TBS) use in clinical practice. TBS is a DXA-based software applied to lumbar spine DXA images previously obtained for bone mineral density (BMD) assessments. An advantage of TBS is that it can be applied retrospectively to previously obtained DXA scans without the need for repeated testing. TBS of the lumbar spine has been shown to predict the risk of fragility fractures independent of BMD and clinical risk factors in men and women over 50 years old. The greatest utility of TBS appears to be for individuals who lie close to a FRAX or BMD T-score pharmacologic intervention threshold. As such, TBS should be used in conjunction with BMD and/or FRAX probability rather than as a standalone measure. TBS can be used to adjust either FRAX probability or BMD T-score and is incorporated in the FRAXplus ® platform, allowing modification of FRAX probability to reflect a TBS measurement.

- **TBS example**:
	- TBS example of a 61-year-old woman. Normative reference data in children and various ethnicities are limited.

TBS, when used in combination with BMD, may add useful information in monitoring response to anabolic or long-term denosumab treatment but is of limited value for bisphosphonate or short-term denosumab therapy. The clinical utility of monitoring with TBS is influenced by the least significant change (LSC) value. It is suggested that the DXA facility calculate a TBS LSC using the same methodology as that described for BMD LSC, or use a conservative estimation for TBS LSC of 5.8%.

### Trabecular bone score: A noninvasive analytical method based upon the DXA image [^115M99Tp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). High credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural metric that can be extracted from the two-dimensional lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image. TBS is related to bone microarchitecture and provides skeletal information that is not captured from the standard bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Based on experimental variograms of the projected DXA image, TBS has the potential to discern differences between DXA scans that show similar BMD measurements. An elevated TBS value correlates with better skeletal microstructure; a low TBS value correlates with weaker skeletal microstructure.

Lumbar spine TBS has been evaluated in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The following conclusions are based upon publications reviewed:

1. TBS gives lower values in postmenopausal women and in men with previous fragility fractures than their nonfractured counterparts.
2. TBS is complementary to lumbar spine DXA measurements.
3. TBS results are lower in women who have sustained a fragility fracture but in whom DXA does not indicate osteoporosis or even osteopenia.
4. TBS predicts fracture risk as well as lumbar spine BMD measurements in postmenopausal women.
5. Efficacious therapies for osteoporosis differ in the extent to which they influence the TBS.
6. TBS is associated with fracture risk in individuals with conditions related to reduced bone mass or bone quality.

Based on these data, lumbar spine TBS holds promise as an emerging technology that could well become a valuable clinical tool in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

### A meta-analysis of trabecular bone score in fracture risk prediction and its relationship to FRAX [^114K51MS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural index of bone microarchitecture derived from lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images. TBS is a bone mineral density (BMD)-independent predictor of fracture risk. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether TBS predicted fracture risk independently of FRAX probability and to examine their combined performance by adjusting the FRAX probability for TBS. We utilized individual-level data from 17,809 men and women in 14 prospective population-based cohorts.

Baseline evaluation included TBS and the FRAX risk variables, and outcomes during follow-up (mean 6.7 years) comprised major osteoporotic fractures. The association between TBS, FRAX probabilities, and the risk of fracture was examined using an extension of the Poisson regression model in each cohort and for each sex, expressed as the gradient of risk (GR; hazard ratio per 1 SD change in risk variable in the direction of increased risk). FRAX probabilities were adjusted for TBS using an adjustment factor derived from an independent cohort (the Manitoba Bone Density Cohort).

Overall, the GR of TBS for major osteoporotic fracture was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.53) when adjusted for age and time since baseline, and was similar in men and women (p > 0.10). When additionally adjusted for FRAX 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture, TBS remained a significant, independent predictor for fracture (GR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.24–1.41). The adjustment of FRAX probability for TBS resulted in a small increase in the GR (1.76, 95% CI 1.41).

### Tbs (trabecular bone score) and diabetes-related fracture risk [^113yMkvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased fracture risk but paradoxically greater bone mineral density (BMD). Trabecular bone score (TBS) is derived from the texture of the spine dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image and is related to bone microarchitecture and fracture risk, providing information independent of BMD. This study evaluated the ability of lumbar spine TBS to account for increased fracture risk in diabetes.

We performed a retrospective cohort study using BMD results from a large clinical registry for the province of Manitoba, Canada. We included 29,407 women 50 years old and older with baseline DXA examinations, among whom 2356 had diagnosed diabetes.

Lumbar spine TBS was derived for each spine DXA examination blinded to clinical parameters and outcomes. Health service records were assessed for incident nontraumatic major osteoporotic fractures (mean follow-up 4.7 years).

Diabetes was associated with higher BMD at all sites but lower lumbar spine TBS in unadjusted and adjusted models (all P < .001). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a measurement in the lowest vs. the highest tertile was less than 1 for BMD (all P < .001) but was increased for lumbar spine TBS [aOR 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.30–2.97]. Major osteoporotic fractures were identified in 175 women (7.4%) with and 1493 (5.5%) without diabetes (P < .001). Lumbar spine TBS was a BMD-independent predictor of fracture and predicted fractures in those with diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.10–1.40).

### Change in trabecular bone score (TBS) with antiresorptive therapy does not predict fracture in women: The Manitoba BMD cohort [^114omRsH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), along with additional clinical risk factors, can be used to identify individuals at high fracture risk. Whether change in TBS in untreated or treated women independently affects fracture risk is unclear. Using the Manitoba (Canada) DXA Registry, which contains all BMD results for the population, we identified 9,044 women aged ≥ 40 years with two consecutive DXA scans who were not receiving osteoporosis treatment at baseline (baseline mean age 62 ± 10 years). We examined BMD and TBS change, osteoporosis treatment, and incident major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) for each individual.

Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 770 women developed an incident MOF. During the interval between the two DXA scans (mean, 4.1 years), 5,083 women initiated osteoporosis treatment (bisphosphonate use 80%), whereas 3,961 women did not receive any osteoporosis treatment. Larger gains in both BMD and TBS were seen in women with greater adherence to osteoporosis medication (p for trend < 0.001), and the magnitude of the increase was consistently greater for BMD than for TBS.

Among treated women, there was a greater antifracture effect for each standard deviation increase in total hip BMD change (fracture decrease 20%; 95% CI, 13% to 26%; p < 0.001), femoral neck BMD change (19%; 95% CI, 12% to 26%; p < 0.001), and lumbar spine BMD change (9%; 95% CI, 0% to 17%; p = 0.049). In contrast, change in TBS did not predict fractures in women who initiated osteoporosis treatment (p = 0.10). Among untreated women, neither change in BMD nor TBS predicted fractures.

We conclude that, unlike changes in BMD, changes in TBS with antiresorptive therapy do not predict fracture risk in women, whether treated or untreated.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^111Jw22r]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study to evaluate the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS), and organ iron overload measured by MRI in iron-overloaded patients. In the study, abnormal bone mass was found at any of the three sites in a total of 9 (22.0%) patients, of which 7 patients had lumbar spine (LS) abnormality. Notably, 19 (46.3%) patients had abnormal microarchitecture by TBS, implying that TBS may be a more sensitive parameter than BMD to assess vertebral bone strength in iron-overloaded patients. Moreover, because TBS uses previously obtained dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images, it is simple to use in routine practice. This enables the generation of longitudinal data concerning cross-sectional and clinical studies and allows direct comparison with areal BMD and application to existing datasets. Hence, the authors propose that TBS be used as a valuable and complementary clinical tool in the general diagnosis of osteoporosis and in fracture risk assessment in iron-overloaded patients. From a clinical perspective, the additional information about bone strength provided by TBS could aid the management of patients with osteopenia, as well as those with normal BMD who have risk factors for osteoporosis.

In the study, TBS of LS showed no significant differences between moderate-severe and no-mild hepatic iron overload groups, nor between these and pancreatic iron overload groups. Neither hepatic nor pancreatic T2✱-value was correlated with LS TBS, consistent with the result by Baldini et al. that TBS did not correlate with liver iron concentration values.

### Association of glycaemic variables with trabecular bone score in post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114dm1Cw]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between bone microarchitecture, as measured by trabecular bone score, and advanced glycation end-product accumulation, as assessed by skin autofluorescence.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study that included 64 post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes and 175 post-menopausal women without diabetes. Trabecular bone score and skin autofluorescence data were obtained at the time of bone density measurement.

- **Results**: Trabecular bone score and skin autofluorescence were inversely correlated in women with type 2 diabetes (r = -0.34, P = 0.006); however, no correlation was observed in post-menopausal women without diabetes (r = -0.029, P = 0.707). After adjustment, neither skin autofluorescence nor a diagnosis of diabetes were associated with trabecular bone score. However, HbA1c and waist circumference were independently associated with trabecular bone score.

- **Conclusion**: Skin autofluorescence did not predict trabecular bone score. In contrast, glycaemia, as reflected by HbA1c, and visceral adiposity, as reflected by waist circumference, were independently associated with trabecular bone score.

### Trabecular bone score (TBS) varies with correction for tissue thickness versus body mass index: Implications when using pediatric reference norms [^114JFmuT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). High credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) derived from secondary analysis of lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans improves fracture prediction independent of bone mineral density (BMD) in adults. The utility of TBS to assess fracture risk in younger patients has not been established because pediatric norms have been lacking. Robust TBS reference data from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) have been published. TBS values for the BMDCS study were derived using an algorithm that accounts for tissue thickness (TBS TH) rather than the commercially available algorithm that adjusts for body mass index (BMI; TBS BMI).

We examined the magnitude of differences in TBS TH and TBS BMI in a cohort of 189 healthy youth. TBS values using both algorithms increased with age and pubertal development in a similar pattern. However, TBS BMI values were systematically and significantly higher than TBS TH (mean = 0.06, p < 0.0001). The difference between calculated TBS BMI and TBS TH was not uniform. Differences were greater at lower TBS values, in males, in older individuals, in those at later Tanner stages, and in those with a greater BMI Z-score. These systematic differences preclude the development of a simple formula to allow conversion of TBS BMI to TBS TH "equivalents".

Because of these systematic differences, using an individual's TBS BMI to calculate a Z-score using the BMDCS TBS TH reference values results in a falsely higher TBS Z-score (differences mean = 0.73, interquartile range [IQR] = 0.3 to 1.6). Until TBS TH software for Hologic D-opti…

### Association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with incident clinical and radiographic vertebral fractures adjusted for lumbar spine BMD in older men: A prospective cohort study [^113zFMwV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

The association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with incident clinical and radiographic vertebral fractures in older men is uncertain. TBS was estimated from baseline spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for 5831 older men (mean age 73.7 years) enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of TBS (per 1 SD decrease) with incident clinical vertebral fractures. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between TBS (per 1 SD decrease) and incident radiographic vertebral fractures among the subset of 4309 men with baseline and follow-up lateral spine radiographs (mean 4.6 years later).

- **Body mass index (BMI) categories**: We also examined whether any associations varied by BMI category. TBS was associated with a 1.41-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 1.63) higher age-adjusted odds of incident radiographic fracture, and this relationship did not vary by BMI (p value = 0.22 for interaction term). This association was no longer significant with further adjustment for lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD; odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.30).

- **Association with clinical vertebral fracture**: In contrast, the age-adjusted association of TBS with incident clinical vertebral fracture was stronger in men with lower BMI (≤ median value of 26.8kg/m²; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.28, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.87) than in men with higher BMI (> median; HR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.94; p value = 0.0002 for interaction term). With further adjustment for lumbar spine BMD, the association of TBS with incident clinical vertebral fracture was substantially attenuated.

### Clinical performance of the updated trabecular bone score (TBS) algorithm, which accounts for the soft tissue thickness: The OsteoLaus Study [^111dXVeH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Low credibility.

Regional soft tissue may have a noise effect on trabecular bone score (TBS) and eventually alter its estimate. The TBS software (TBS iNsight®) is based on an algorithm accounting for body mass index (BMI) (TBS v3.03). We aimed to explore the updated TBS algorithm that accounts for soft tissue thickness (TBS v4.0). This study was embedded in the OsteoLaus cohort of women in Lausanne, Switzerland. Hip and lumbar spine (LS) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed using the Discovery A System (Hologic).

The incident major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) were assessed from vertebral fracture assessments using Genant's method (vertebral MOF) or questionnaires (nonvertebral MOF). We assessed the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD) or TBS with body composition parameters, the MOF prediction ability of both versions of TBS, and the differences between Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) adjusted for TBS v3.03 or TBS v4.0. In total, 1362 women with mean ± SD age 64.4 ± 7.5 years and mean ± SD BMI 25.9 ± 4.5 kg/m² were followed for 4.4 years, and 132 experienced an MOF.

All the anthropometric measurements of our interest were positively correlated with LS, femoral neck, or hip BMD and TBS v4.0, whereas with TBS v3.03 their correlations were negative. In the models adjusted for age, soft tissue thickness, osteoporotic treatment, and LS-BMD, for each SD decline in TBS v3.03, there was a 43% (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83) increase in the odds of having MOF; whereas for each SD decline in TBS v4.0, there was a 54% (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.00) increase in the odds.

### Effects of zoledronate versus placebo on spine bone mineral density and microarchitecture assessed by the trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: a three-year study [^116Txnsi]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) is an index of bone microarchitectural texture calculated from anteroposterior dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the lumbar spine (LS) that predicts fracture risk, independent of bone mineral density (BMD). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of yearly intravenous zoledronate (ZOL) versus placebo (PLB) on LS BMD and TBS in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Changes in TBS were assessed in the subset of 107 patients recruited at the Department of Osteoporosis of the University Hospital of Berne, Switzerland, who were included in the HORIZON trial. All subjects received adequate calcium and vitamin D3. These patients were randomly assigned to either ZOL (n = 54) or PLB (n = 53) for 3 years, with BMD measured by DXA and TBS assessed by TBS iNsight (v1.9) at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment initiation.

Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were similar between groups in terms of age, 76.8 ± 5.0 years; body mass index (BMI), 24.5 ± 3.6 kg/m²; and TBS, 1.178 ± 0.1. However, there was a difference in LS T-score (ZOL -2.9 ± 1.5 versus PLB -2.1 ± 1.5). Changes in LS BMD were significantly greater with ZOL than with PLB at all time points (p < 0.0001 for all), reaching +9.58% versus +1.38% at month 36. Change in TBS was significantly greater with ZOL than with PLB as of month 24, reaching +1.41% versus -0.49% at month 36 (p = 0.031). LS BMD and TBS were weakly correlated (r = 0.20) and there were no correlations between changes in BMD and TBS from baseline at any visit.

### Trabecular bone score (TBS) — a novel method to evaluate bone microarchitectural texture in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^1136GN7t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

In the milder form of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), cancellous bone, represented by areal bone mineral density at the lumbar spine via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is preserved. This finding contrasts with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) results, which indicate abnormal trabecular microstructure, and epidemiological evidence supporting an increased overall fracture risk in PHPT. Since DXA does not directly measure trabecular bone and HRpQCT is not widely available, we employed trabecular bone score (TBS), a novel gray-level textural analysis applied to spine DXA images, to indirectly estimate trabecular microarchitecture.

The purpose of this study was to assess TBS from spine DXA images in relation to HRpQCT indices and bone stiffness in the radius and tibia in PHPT.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a referral center.

Participants were 22 postmenopausal women with PHPT.

- **Main outcome measures**: Outcomes measured included areal bone mineral density by DXA, TBS indices derived from DXA images, HRpQCT standard measures, and bone stiffness assessed by finite element analysis at the distal radius and tibia.

TBS in PHPT was low at 1.24, representing abnormal trabecular microstructure (normal ≥ 1.35). TBS correlated with whole bone stiffness and all HRpQCT indices, except for trabecular thickness and trabecular stiffness at the radius. At the tibia, correlations were observed between TBS and volumetric densities, cortical thickness, trabecular bone volume, and whole bone stiffness.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^11716UsZ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

The aims of the study were to determine the mean trabecular bone score (TBS) of postmenopausal Taiwanese women and to analyze the value of TBS in predicting osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,915 postmenopausal women with lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) and spine TBS were enrolled from a single medical center into this study. The women's BMD and TBS were measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Discovery Wi; Hologic, Bedford, Mass) and iNsight software (Med-Imaps SASU, Merignac, France), respectively. The women's demographic characteristics; lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD; and lumbar spine TBS were recorded. Correlations among the parameters were identified using a 2-tailed Pearson test, in which a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Simple linear regression models were developed to represent changes related to TBS, and an analysis of variance was performed on the selected variables.

- **Results**: The average age of the women was 62.5 ± 9.1 years (range, 25.7–93.7 years). The mean TBS was 1.300 ± 0.086 (range, 1.015–1.596). The TBS was weakly and negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.078) and moderately and positively correlated with the lumbar spine BMD (r = 0.619). The patients' lowest BMD values among those measured at multiple sites revealed a higher rate of osteoporosis (32.5%) than those measured at individual sites. Degraded TBS were noted in 21.2% of the participants, and a combination of BMD and TBS results predicted more individuals (7.8%) at a high risk of fracture than did the BMD alone.

### Prediction of incident major osteoporotic and hip fractures by trabecular bone score (TBS) and prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture in older men [^113Fuiw3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) has been shown to predict major osteoporotic (clinical vertebral, hip, humerus, and wrist) and hip fractures in postmenopausal women and older men, but the association of TBS with these incident fractures in men independent of prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture is unknown. TBS was estimated on anteroposterior (AP) spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans obtained at the baseline visit for 5,979 men aged ≥ 65 years enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study, and its association with incident major osteoporotic and hip fractures was estimated with proportional hazards models.

Model discrimination was tested with Harrell's C-statistic and with a categorical net reclassification improvement index using 10-year risk cutpoints of 20% for major osteoporotic and 3% for hip fractures. For each standard deviation decrease in TBS, there were hazard ratios of 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 1.39) for major osteoporotic fracture and 1.20 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39) for hip fracture, adjusted for FRAX with bone mineral density (BMD) 10-year fracture risks and prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture. In the same model, those with prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture compared with those without prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture had hazard ratios of 1.92 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.48) for major osteoporotic fracture and 1.86 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.74) for hip fracture. There were improvements of 3.3%, 5.2%, and 6.2%, respectively, in the classification of major osteoporotic fracture cases when TBS and prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures were considered.

### Trabecular bone score and incident fragility fracture risk in adults with reduced kidney function [^113MdQp8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score is a gray-level textural measure obtained from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry lumbar spine images that provides information independent of areal bone mineral density. The association between trabecular bone score and incident fractures in adults with reduced kidney function, and whether this association differs from that of adults with normal kidney function, are unknown.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: We included 1426 participants aged ≥ 40 years (mean age 67 years) in the community-based Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study. We stratified participants at cohort entry (2005–2008) by eGFR (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² [n = 199; 72.4% stage 3a, 25.1% stage 3b, and 2.5% stage 4] versus ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² [n = 1227]). Trabecular bone score was obtained from lumbar spine (L1-L4) dual energy X-ray absorptiometry images, with a lower trabecular bone score representing worse bone structure. Over an average of 4.7 years of follow-up (maximum 5 years), we documented incident fragility (low-trauma) fracture events (excluding craniofacial, foot, and hand sites). We used a modified Kaplan-Meier estimator to determine the 5-year probability of fracture. Cox proportional hazard regression per SD lower trabecular bone score expressed the gradient of fracture risk.

- **Results**: Individuals with an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² who had a trabecular bone score value below the median (< 1.277) had a significantly higher 5-year fracture probability than those above the median (18.1% versus 6.2%; P = 0.01).

### Trabecular bone score improves fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^114FQuJF]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

To analyze the clinical utility of trabecular bone score (TBS) evaluation for fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid (GC)-treated patients compared with BMD assessment, a cross-sectional study included one hundred and twenty-seven patients on GC treatment [mean age 62 (18) years, 63% women]. The study evaluated medical history, anthropometric data, lumbar and femoral BMD (DXA) [considering osteoporosis (OP): T-score ≤ -2.5], TBS (considering degraded microarchitecture: < 1.230), and dorsolumbar X-ray [to assess vertebral fractures (VF)]. BMD and TBS sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were evaluated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the two methods.

All patients were receiving GC treatment for autoimmune diseases for 47.7 (68.9) months at a mean daily dose of 14.5 mg. Among them, 17% had VF, 28% any type of fragility fracture (VF + non-VF), 29% OP, and 52% degraded microarchitecture. Degraded microarchitecture was significantly more frequent than densitometric OP in patients with VF (76% vs. 38%) and with any fragility fracture (69% vs. 36%). For VF, TBS and BMD sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.76, 0.53, 0.25, and 0.92, and 0.38, 0.72, 0.22, and 0.85, respectively. Specificity increased to 0.89 for VF and 0.9 for any fragility fracture when combining BMD+TBS. TBS had a better ability than BMD to discriminate between patients with fractures, especially VF (area under the curve = 0.73).

In conclusion, TBS appears to have greater discriminative power than BMD for fracture risk assessment in GC-treated patients.

### Clinical utility of using lumbar spine trabecular bone score to adjust fracture probability: The Manitoba BMD cohort [^116Lak3Y]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Decreased lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS), a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived image texture measurement, is a risk factor for major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF), independent of the 10-year fracture probability estimated using FRAX. We determined how often applying the TBS adjustment to fracture probability altered treatment qualification. Using a population-based registry containing all clinical DXA results for Manitoba, Canada, we identified 34,316 women with baseline spine and hip DXA, FRAX-based fracture probability measurements (computed with femoral neck bone mineral density), lumbar spine TBS, and a minimum of 5 years of observation (mean 8.7 years).

Population-based health services data were used to identify incident non-traumatic MOF and HF in 3,503 and 945 women, respectively. Baseline MOF and HF probabilities were estimated using FRAX before and after applying the TBS adjustment. Risk recategorization was assessed using net reclassification improvement (NRI) for individual FRAX-based intervention criteria and three national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) (US National Osteoporosis Foundation, Osteoporosis Canada, and UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group). Overall, proportions of women reclassified with the TBS adjustment to FRAX were small (less than 5%), with more than 90% of the reclassification occurring close to the intervention threshold. For women close to an intervention cut-off, reclassification rates ranged from 9.0% to 17.9% and were less than 1% otherwise. There was a small but significant improvement in overall NRI.

### Short-term precision assessment of trabecular bone score and bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry with different scan modes: an in vivo study [^116jjCq1]. European Radiology (2015). High credibility.

We estimated the in vivo reproducibility of trabecular bone score (TBS) from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using different imaging modes to be compared to that of bone mineral density (BMD).

- **Methods**: We enrolled 30 patients for each imaging mode: fast-array, array, and high definition. Each patient underwent two DXA examinations with in-between repositioning. BMD and TBS were obtained according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was calculated as the ratio between root mean square standard deviation and mean. The percent least significant change (LSC) was calculated as 2.77×CoV, and reproducibility as the complement to 100% LSC.

- **Results**: The fast-array imaging mode resulted in 0.8% CoV and 2.1% LSC for BMD, and 1.9% CoV and 5.3% LSC for TBS. The array imaging mode resulted in 0.7% CoV and 2.0% LSC for BMD, and 1.9% CoV and 5.2% LSC for TBS. The high-definition imaging mode resulted in 0.7% CoV and 2.0% LSC for BMD, and 2.0% CoV and 5.4% LSC for TBS. Reproducibility of TBS (95%) was significantly lower than BMD (98%) (p < 0.012). The difference in reproducibility among the imaging modes was not significant for either BMD or TBS (p = 0.942).

- **Conclusion**: While TBS reproducibility was significantly lower than BMD, differences among imaging modes were not significant for both TBS and BMD.

- **Key points**:
	- TBS is an emerging tool for assessing BMD.
	- TBS reproducibility is lower than BMD.
	- Differences between imaging modes are not significant for either TBS or BMD.

### Factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in non-osteoporotic elderly population: Bushehr elderly health program [^113ThF4M]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) are moderately correlated. TBS is sometimes used as an adjuvant to BMD in fracture risk assessment. Some individuals with normal BMD or osteopenia have more degraded TBS. We aimed to identify factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in the non-osteoporotic elderly population.

- **Methods**: The study subjects were selected from 2,384 women and men aged ≥ 60 years participating in the second stage of the Bushehr Elderly Health program, a population-based prospective cohort study in Iran. The BMDs of different sites and the lumbar spine texture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the TBS algorithm, respectively. Subjects were categorized based on their BMD and TBS status. Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with "TBS worse than BMD" in non-osteoporotic individuals.

- **Results**: Of 1,335 participants included in the study, 112 of 457 women and 54 of 878 men had worse TBS than BMD. In multivariable analysis, TBS worse than BMD in women was statistically significantly associated with years since menopause (OR: 1.04 [1.00–1.07]) and waist circumference (OR: 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). However, in men, the condition was statistically significantly associated with waist circumference (OR: 1.10 [1.03–1.17]), smoking (OR: 2.54 [1.10–5.84]), and HDL-C (OR: 1.03 [1.00–1.06]).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study show that higher waist circumference is associated with more degraded TBS than BMD in both men and women. Years passed since menopause and smoking are also significant factors.

### Cortical unlike trabecular bone loss is not associated with vascular calcification progression in CKD patients [^115rwwzh]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronary calcium scores significantly increased during the study. CAC was observed in 33 (46%) patients at baseline, and CAC progression was noted in 30 (91%) of these patients. Table 2 depicts the correlations between cortical and trabecular bone density changes with other variables. Cortical bone change correlated to HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.26; p = 0.03), while trabecular bone change inversely correlated to the duration of CKD (r = −0.25; p = 0.04).

Cortical bone changes were associated with smoking, with mean changes of −1.07 ± 8.2 HU for smokers and 3.73 ± 10.5 HU for non-smokers (p = 0.04). No differences in cortical and trabecular bone changes were observed with regards to gender, presence of diabetes, obesity, use of medicines, or other laboratory parameters. Notably, there was no correlation between cortical and trabecular bone density changes (r = 0.19; p = 0.12).

- **Univariate analysis**: Shows cortical and trabecular vertebral bone density changes in Table 2.

Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between cortical (Fig. 4a) and trabecular (Fig. 4b) bone densities with vascular calcification progression. There was no correlation between cortical bone and calcium score changes, while an inverse correlation between changes in trabecular bone and calcium score was observed.

- **Multivariate analysis**: No correlations were found between cortical changes and calcium score changes, even after adjustment for HDL changes.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^1155Gpyh]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

In our study, the BMD assessment results indicated that 32.5% of the participants (622/1915) had osteoporosis. This rate increased by 7.8% when the patients' risk of osteoporosis was evaluated using a combination of the BMD assessment and TBS. Among the patients exhibiting degraded TBS, 3.3% (11/330) and 14.4% (139/963) had normal bone density and low bone mass, respectively. Our results are similar to those of a previous South Korean study that reported a 10.1% higher risk of osteoporosis after incorporating TBS into osteoporosis risk assessment. Therefore, TBS are helpful for identifying patients with poor bone quality, but not those with reduced bone density. According to the results of our age analysis, higher rates of degraded TBS in the patients without osteoporosis were noted in older age groups, and the rates of degraded and partially degraded TBS were 26.9% (7/26) and 34.6% (9/26), respectively, in the subgroup of patients older than 70 years with normal bone density. Our findings suggest that a combination of TBS and BMD assessments can be used to identify a higher number of postmenopausal Taiwanese women at risk of osteoporosis than BMD assessment alone, and that a higher rate of poor bone quality, determined according to degraded TBS, was noted in older women without low BMD.

Several studies have examined the effects of BMI on BMD and TBS in various ethnic groups. In our study, BMD was positively correlated with BMI; this finding is consistent with the results of studies involving not only White women but also Asian women. However, our results indicated that TBS was…

### Brief, low-impact, high-intensity osteogenic loading in postmenopausal osteoporosis: A quasi-experimental case-series study [^11214vhr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Apart from standard dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), currently considered the gold standard for evaluating BMD, the measurement of the trabecular bone score (TBS) — a grey-level textural measurement typically obtained from conventional lumbar spine DXA-BMD images — serves as a validated index of bone microarchitecture correlated with the mechanical properties of the bone. TBS has been added to the already established methods of fracture risk assessment for predicting fracture risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or lower at the femoral neck, based on reference data from white women aged 20–29 years, as established by the NHANES III database. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older may also be made if the T-score at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck is −2.5 or lower.

The consensus from the 2023 International Society of Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommends that regions of interest for diagnosis of osteoporosis include the lumbar spine, total hip, and/or femoral neck (with a recommendation to use the lowest T-score from the femoral neck or total hip). A recent study underscored the clinical relevance of discordances in bone mineral density (BMD) measurements between the femoral neck and other proximal femur regions, particularly the trochanter and total hip. Although BMD measurements at the trochanter and total hip are routinely obtained alongside femoral neck assessments, their independent predictive value fo

### Does baseline PTH influence recovery of bone mineral density, trabecular bone score and bone turnover markers? A prospective study following curative parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism [^114zWzQv]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the trabecular bone score, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone biochemistry in Indian subjects with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). It also aimed to investigate the influence of baseline parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the recovery of these parameters following curative surgery.

This was a two-year prospective study conducted at a tertiary care center in southern India. Baseline assessment included demographic details, mode of presentation, bone mineral biochemistry, BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS), and bone turnover markers (BTMs). These parameters were reassessed at the end of the first and second years following curative parathyroid surgery.

Fifty-one subjects (32 men and 19 women) with PHPT who had undergone curative parathyroidectomy were included in this study. The mean (SD) age was 44.6 (13.7) years. At baseline, the TBS, BTMs, and BMD at the lumbar spine and forearm were significantly worse in subjects with higher baseline PTH (≥ 250 pg/mL) compared to those with lower baseline PTH (< 250 pg/mL). At the end of two years, the difference between the high versus low PTH groups (mean ± SD) persisted only for forearm BMD (0.638 ± 0.093 versus 0.698 ± 0.041 g/cm²; p = 0.01). However, during follow-up visits in the first and second year after curative parathyroidectomy, there was no significant difference in BTMs, BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and TBS between the two groups stratified by baseline PTH.

The BMD at the forearm remained significantly worse in individuals with high baseline PTH even at the end of the study.

### Bibliometric analysis of publications on trabecular bone score (TBS) [^111vCgjZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS), as a texture indicator of bone microarchitecture, predicts the risk of fracture. This study aims to explore the knowledge map of TBS.

- **Methods**: We searched Scopus for "trabecular bone score" or "trabecular score" from the beginning to 2021. Our inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews related to TBS. We excluded non-English articles, articles not related to TBS, and document types other than original articles and reviews. Related documents were included for bibliometric analysis. Excel, VOS viewer, and Science of Science (Sci2) software were used for data synthesis.

- **Results**: From 749 retrieved articles, 652 articles were included for analysis. These documents were cited 12,153 times and had an H-index of 56. The highest productivity was from the United States (n = 130 documents), Switzerland (n = 101), and Italy (n = 67). "Osteoporosis International" (n = 80) had the highest participation in publishing. The research topics of interest were mainly related to the applicability of TBS for fracture risk assessment in chronic endocrine disorders such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Bursting analysis of the title and abstract revealed the initial focus of the discriminative power of TBS for osteoporotic fracture and the more recent focus on comparing bone mineral density (BMD) and TBS in various chronic diseases.

- **Conclusion**: The number of annual publications on TBS has increased, especially after 2016. These publications highlight the importance of in-depth knowledge of TBS in predicting fracture risk.

### Bone microarchitecture assessed by trabecular bone score is independent of mobility level or height in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy [^1131WczJ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

Bone strength and fracture risk depend not only on bone density but also on bone structure. The trabecular bone score (TBS) evaluates the homogeneity of bone microarchitecture indirectly by measuring gray-level variations of two-dimensional (2D) DXA images. Although TBS is well-established for adults, there have been only a few publications in pediatrics. In this monocentric retrospective analysis, we investigated TBS in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), a patient group vulnerable to low bone mineral mass due to impaired mobility.

The influence of different parameters on TBS and areal BMD (aBMD) were evaluated, as well as the relationship between TBS and aBMD. We compared TBS values of our study population to a reference population. A total of 472 lumbar spine-dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (LS-DXA) scans of children and adolescents with CP (205 female), aged between 4 and 18 years, were analyzed. The DXA scans were part of the routine examination. The children had no records of fractures or specific bone diseases. Our study population with CP had similar TBS as the reference population. TBS did not increase with age until an inflection point at 10 years in females and 12 years in males. Girls had significantly higher TBS than boys (p = .049) and pubertal girls aged 8 to 13 years had significantly higher TBS than prepubertal girls (p = .009).

TBS standard deviation score for age (SDS-TBS) and aBMD Z-scores correlated weakly (p < .001; R = 0.276 for males, R = 0.284 for females). Unlike aBMD Z-scores, SDS-TBS was not influenced by age-adjusted height Z-scores.

### A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of trabecular bone score in adults with Turner syndrome [^111jFMg6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with short stature, gonadal failure, and fractures. Spinal trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel bone imaging modality that has not been evaluated in TS. The objective of this study was to evaluate TBS in TS and its association with bone mineral density (BMD), prevalent fracture, and risk factors.

This was a longitudinal study of TS conducted at a single tertiary hospital between 2006 and 2017. The study involved 58 subjects with TS aged 20 to 49 years who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The main outcome measures included TBS, DXA parameters, and prevalent fractures.

- **Results**: Normal, partially degraded, and degraded TBSs were observed in 39 (67%), 15 (26%), and four (7%) subjects, respectively. High rates of prescribed estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) with stable TBS and BMD were observed during follow-up. TBS was positively correlated with spine and femoral neck (FN) BMD and Z-scores (all P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with age (-0.004 per year; P = 0.014) and delay in ERT initiation in women with primary amenorrhea (-0.010 per year; P < 0.001). Fractures were present in 17 (31%) subjects. Low TBS had a significantly higher area under the receiver operator curve for predicting prevalent fracture than low bone mass at either the spine or FN (P < 0.05). Subjects with no history of fracture were more likely to have a normal TBS (P = 0.023).

- **Conclusions**: BMD and TBS can be preserved with early initiation and continued use of ERT. TBS may provide additional fracture risk prediction to standard bone density measurements.

### BMD-related genetic risk scores predict site-specific fractures as well as trabecular and cortical bone microstructure [^116qn4gR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The ultrasound-based genetic risk score, eBMD GRS, displays modest correlations with the DXA-based genetic risk scores, FN-BMD GRS and LS-BMD GRS. The means and standard deviations (SDs) of the three bone-related GRSs, including the heel ultrasound-based eBMD GRS and the DXA-based FN-BMD GRS and LS-BMD GRS, were similar in the three evaluated Swedish cohorts: UFO hip fracture, UFO forearm fracture, and MrOS Sweden.

To determine if these three GRSs might have the potential to contribute independent information for the prediction of bone health–related parameters, we first evaluated their intercorrelations in the three clinical cohorts used in the present study. The FN-BMD GRS explained as much as 53.5% to 55% of the variance of the other DXA-based genetic risk score, LS-BMD GRS, in the three cohorts. In contrast, the variances in the two DXA-based risk scores explained by the newly developed ultrasound-based eBMD GRS were rather modest: FN-BMD GRS (9.2% to 13.5%) and LS-BMD GRS (12.6% to 14.8%).

Thus, the new eBMD GRS might contribute substantial independent information beyond the two previously evaluated DXA-based GRSs for prediction of different bone-related parameters. We next confirmed in the MrOS Sweden cohort that the different evaluated GRSs were associated with the underlying bone phenotype used for the development of the respective GRS, with a high GRS indicating a low value of the bone parameter. As expected, the eBMD GRS was significantly inversely associated with eBMD (variance explained R² = 17.0%; P = 8.5 × 10⁻⁶⁸). The FN-BMD GRS was significantly inversely associated with…

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^111LM5gx]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) can be used in combination to predict osteoporosis in a greater number of postmenopausal Taiwanese women. Because the incidence of osteoporosis is highest among older women, clinicians should pay careful attention to TBS degradation among older patients without low BMD.

### Changes in trabecular bone score and their determinants in young and middle-aged men: a longitudinal observational study [^112h17fi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Objective: To study bone turnover markers (BTM) and sex steroids in relation to trabecular bone score (TBS) in men.

- **Materials and methods**: Longitudinal, population-based study in 465 healthy men, aged 25–45 years at baseline. Lumbar spine TBS was calculated with TBS iNsight® version 4 (v19.4.1, core module, Medimaps, Pessac, France), which adjusts for soft tissue thickness correction via DXA measurements. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), C-terminal telopeptide, and pro-collagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide were measured using immunoassays. Total testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and free T and free E2 were calculated. Statistical analyses were conducted via linear mixed-effects modeling.

- **Results**: At baseline, TBS was positively associated with free testosterone (p = 0.01), free estradiol, and total estradiol (both p < 0.001), but not with total testosterone nor with BTM. Over a follow-up of 12.5 years, TBS declined by 1.43% (p < 0.001). Higher baseline BMI and trunk fat were predictive of greater decreases in TBS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). Baseline levels of sex steroids and BTM, nor changes therein, were associated with changes in TBS.

- **Conclusions**: TBS already decreases in young and middle-aged healthy men, corroborating earlier studies showing early decrease of trabecular bone volume and changes in trabecular microarchitecture. Although we identified some potentially contributing determinants, the underlying mechanisms of changes in TBS and trabecular bone in young men are yet to be fully elucidated.

### Spine trabecular bone score as an indicator of bone microarchitecture at the peripheral skeleton in kidney transplant recipients [^116VEXUV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Studies using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography have shown progressive abnormalities in cortical and trabecular microarchitecture and biomechanical competence over the first year after kidney transplantation. However, high-resolution peripheral computed tomography is primarily a research tool with limited availability. In contrast, the trabecular bone score is a novel and widely available tool that employs gray-scale variograms of the spine image from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to assess trabecular quality. There are no studies assessing whether the trabecular bone score characterizes bone quality in kidney transplant recipients.

- **Design, settings, participants, and measurements**: Between 2009 and 2010, we conducted a study to assess changes in peripheral skeletal microarchitecture, measured by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography, during the first year after transplantation in 47 patients managed with early corticosteroid-withdrawal immunosuppression. All adult first-time transplant candidates were eligible. Patients underwent imaging with high-resolution peripheral computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry pretransplantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. We now test if, during the first year after transplantation, the trabecular bone score assesses the evolution of bone microarchitecture and biomechanical competence as determined by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography.

### Changes to bone mineral density, the trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis following parathyroidectomy: a case report [^111efWz1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Many patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism have reduced bone mineral density (BMD), particularly in regions consisting primarily of cortical bone, with relative sparing of trabecular bone. Following parathyroidectomy, BMD generally increases; however, longitudinal changes to the trabecular bone score, and to parameters measured by hip structural analysis, have not been described. Additionally, post-operative positive calcium balance, caused by requirements for massive supplementation with calcium and calcitriol or its analogues, raises concern for the risk of vascular calcification.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^113YR8dk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Iron-overloaded patients are recognized as presenting an increased risk of osteoporosis. However, studies on the correlation between osteoporosis and organ iron overload are controversial or scarce. The aim of this study is to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in correlation with hepatic and pancreatic iron overload.

- **Methods**: Forty-one patients diagnosed with hemoglobinopathies were studied. BMDs of the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. LS bone quality was derived from each spine DXA examination using the TBS analysis. Hepatic and pancreatic iron overload were obtained with a multi-echo gradient echo T2✱ technique.

- **Results**: Abnormal microarchitecture and abnormal bone mass were observed in 19/41 (46.3%) and 9/41 (22.0%) patients, respectively. For 26 males, BMD, T-score, and Z-score of LS were significantly lower among subjects with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload than their counterparts, as well as between no- and moderate-severe pancreatic iron overload groups. For 15 females, patients with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD and T-score of FN and TH, and patients with pancreatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD and T-score of FN, and lower BMD, T-score, and Z-score of TH than their counterparts. Moreover, pancreatic T2✱ value was positively correlated with BMD and T-score at all analyzed sites and Z-score at TH.

- **Conclusion**: These data showed lower bone mass in patients with organ iron overload, particularly for LS in males.

### Effect of denosumab on trabecular bone score in de novo kidney transplant recipients [^116XKPSN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are at risk of losing bone mass. The trabecular bone score (TBS) represents a recently developed parameter of lumbar spine trabecular bone texture that correlates with the occurrence of fractures.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the 1-year changes in TBS in 44 de novo KTR who were randomized 1:1 to receive denosumab or no treatment. TBS was derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and was correlated with 1-year areal bone mineral density (aBMD) changes at the lumbar spine and total hip. Correlations were also performed with parameters of peripheral bone microarchitecture and bone strength at the distal tibia and distal radius, as assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) and micro-finite element analysis.

- **Results**: The baseline TBS in KTR amounted to 1.312 ± 0.101, which is lower than the TBS of an age-matched normal control population (range 1.364–1.471). The TBS correlated positively with aBMD at the lumbar spine (Spearman's ρ = 0.56; P < 0.001) and total hip (ρ = 0.33; P < 0.05). The baseline TBS also correlated with HRpQCT-derived total (ρ = 0.49; P < 0.05) and trabecular volumetric BMD (ρ = 0.57; P < 0.01) and trabecular separation (ρ = -0.46; P < 0.05) at the tibia. Denosumab treatment led to an increase in TBS, paralleling the BMD changes at the lumbar spine.

- **Conclusions**: The TBS is a useful additional score of bone health, which may help to better define fracture risk. Treatment with denosumab led to improved trabecular bone texture in de novo KTR in addition to its beneficial effect on BMD.

### Bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture screening in lung transplant candidates [^112CVgYP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Lung transplant candidates routinely undergo dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening due to an increased risk of osteoporosis secondary to comorbidities and prolonged immunosuppression. Nonetheless, postoperative insufficiency fractures have been well documented, even in patients with normal bone mineral density (BMD). This study investigated the added value of the trabecular bone score (TBS) as a complementary screening index of bone microarchitecture.

A retrospective review of 143 lung transplant candidates who underwent preoperative DXA screening was performed. TBS was calculated from the DXA of the lumbar spine. DXA and TBS measurements were standardized using T-scores with reference to established population-based datasets.

Differences in the observed rates of osteopenia (36.4%), osteoporosis (11.2%), partially degraded bone (35.0%), and degraded bone (35.0%) were statistically significant (P < .001). Abnormal trabecular microarchitecture was significantly more prevalent than abnormal BMD (69.9% versus 47.6%; P < .001). TBS T-scores (mean = -1.98, SD = 1.39) were, on average, significantly lower than DXA T-scores (mean = -0.80, SD = 1.57; t[142] = 9.09; P < .001). Hispanic patients (mean = -1.25, SD = 1.28) had significantly lower DXA T-scores compared with White (mean = -0.28, SD = 1.14) or Black patients (mean = -0.30, SD = 1.31; F[2, 109] = 8.28; P < .001). By contrast, TBS T-scores did not differ by race or ethnicity (F[2, 109] = 0.26; p = 0.78).

Impaired trabecular microarchitecture is extremely common among lung transplant candidates.

### Trabecular bone score reference values for children and adolescents according to age, sex, and ancestry [^117F4Pbn]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is used for fracture prediction in adults, but its utility in children is limited by the absence of appropriate reference values. We aimed to develop reference ranges for TBS by age, sex, and population ancestry for youth ages 5 to 20 years. We also investigated the association between height, body mass index (BMI), and TBS; agreement between TBS and lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) Z-scores; tracking of TBS Z-scores over time; and precision of TBS measurements.

We performed a secondary analysis of spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS), a mixed longitudinal cohort of healthy children (n = 2014) evaluated at five US centers. TBS was derived using a dedicated TBS algorithm accounting for tissue thickness rather than BMI. TBS increased only during ages corresponding to pubertal development, with an earlier increase in females than males. There were no differences in TBS between African Americans and non-African Americans.

We provide sex-specific TBS reference ranges and LMS values for calculation of TBS Z-scores by age and means and standard deviations for calculation of Z-scores by pubertal stage. TBS Z-scores were positively associated with height Z-scores at some ages. TBS Z-scores explained only 27% and 17% of the variance of spine aBMD and BMAD Z-scores. Tracking of TBS Z-scores over six years was lower (r = 0.47) than for aBMD or BMAD Z-scores (r = 0.74 to 0.79), and the precision error of TBS (2.87%) was greater than for aBMD (0.85%) and BMAD (1.22%).

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal taiwanese women [^115BFLhZ]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

Effect of age on the assessment of BMD and TBS

- **Distribution of patients and TBS**: Table 2 presents the distribution of patients of different age groups at high risk of fracture according to the BMD (T score ≤ −2.5) at different sites, TBS, and combined assessment of BMD and TBS. The ratios of patients with BMD T scores of −2.5 or lower at different sites and across all measurement sites increased with age. The ratios of patients with degraded TBS also increased with age.

- **Assessment of BMD and TBS**: Figure 2 presents the distribution of BMD and TBS assessments in different age groups. Among the patients without osteoporosis, 150 had degraded TBS, and the ratios of patients with degraded TBS increased with age not only in the low bone mass group but also in the normal bone density group.

- **Prediction rate for osteoporosis**: In our analysis of the different ages in the prediction rate for osteoporosis when using a combination of the lowest BMD and degraded TBS, the percent increase among the women 70 years or older was the highest (14.4%) and was significantly higher than those among the women younger than 50 years (0.0%, P < 0.001) and 50 to 59 years (3.0%, P < 0.001). The percent increase among the women aged 60 to 69 years (10.5%) was also significantly higher than those among the women younger than 50 years (0.0%, P = 0.003) and 50 to 59 years (3.0%, P < 0.001). The percent increase among the women aged 60 to 69 years did not differ significantly from that among the women 70 years or older (P = 0.108).

### Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: A cross-sectional single-centre experience with bone histomorphometry and quantitative computed tomography [^115KRHzq]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In the study, which used QCT to discriminate cortical and cancellous bone compartments, a decrease in both trabecular and cortical BMD Z-scores was observed, with greater impairments in trabecular BMD. This confirms previous reports highlighting the greater importance of impaired trabecular bone in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. However, the low Z-score for both BMD and cross-sectional area in the cortical compartment may explain the significant frequency of cortical fractures also observed in this cohort. Although children with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis are usually known to present both vertebral compression fractures and long bone fractures, in our series, only two patients presented with vertebral compression fractures, whereas long bone fractures and extremity fractures (e.g. toes, metatarsals) were much more frequent.

Due to the retrospective design of the study, compression fractures were not systematically screened in the patients, but only in cases of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the association between histomorphometry and QCT parameters highlights the potential interest of this non-invasive three-dimensional imaging technique for the follow-up of children with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. In some patients, the biopsy and QCT were not obtained at the same age due to the retrospective design of the study, which may have lessened the association between QCT and bone biopsy. However, to the best of our knowledge, this association between QCT and bone biopsy has never been evaluated in pediatrics, and further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate its potential clinical relevance.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^116gZ31W]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) at the lumbar spine was analyzed using the lumbar spine (L1‐L4) DXA scan data and TBS iNsight software (version 3.0); the precision error was 1.33%. The reference curve was divided into three sections to represent TBS values for Asian populations: TBS ≥ 1.310 indicates normal bone microarchitecture, 1.230 < TBS < 1.310 indicates partially degraded bone microarchitecture, and TBS ≤ 1.230 indicates degraded bone microarchitecture.

- **Inconsistent selection conditions between TBS and BMD**: This study divided inconsistencies between bone mineral density (BMD) and TBS into three groups: (1) normal BMD with partially degraded TBS, (2) normal BMD with degraded TBS, and (3) low bone mass with degraded TBS. An analysis was performed on four age groups: younger than 50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.

- **Statistical analysis**: The descriptive statistics were age, height, weight, BMI, TBS, and BMD. Each patient's BMI was calculated by dividing their weight by the square of their height (in kilograms per square meter). The correlations among the parameters were determined using a Pearson two-tailed test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The χ² test was performed to determine consistency between osteoporosis BMD and TBS in predicting osteoporosis. Differences in the rates of osteoporosis diagnosed according to the lowest BMD and according to the combination of the lowest BMD and TBS in the different age groups were determined through one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test, in which a P value less than 0.0125 (0.05/4) was considered significant.

### Trabecular bone score may indicate chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) phenotypes in hemodialysis patients: a prospective observational study [^114nrMbT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a recently developed diagnostic tool for assessing the image texture obtained from standard lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and provides information on bone microarchitecture independent of bone mineral density (BMD). Higher TBS values represent more homogenous, strong, and fracture-resistant bone. TBS can be simply derived from available DXA images, requiring no additional scanning time or radiation exposure. Moreover, TBS is inexpensive, non-invasive, and readily clinically available compared to non-DXA imaging or bone biopsy. Previous studies have demonstrated that TBS correlates with both cortical and trabecular three-dimensional microarchitecture parameters, such as trabecular volume, number, thickness, spacing, connectivity, and stiffness, as measured by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) or micro-CT.

At the time of writing, only a few studies have assessed TBS in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The studies have shown that TBS was significantly reduced in ESRD populations, and lower TBS is associated with increased prevalent or incident fractures in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, no studies have assessed the connections between TBS and adverse clinical outcomes related to CKD-MBD in hemodialysis patients, except those studying fracture events.

In this study, we investigated whether TBS is associated with the comorbidities related to CKD-MBD or frailty in hemodialysis patients.

### Factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in non-osteoporotic elderly population: Bushehr elderly health program [^114JQUVC]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) are moderately correlated. TBS is sometimes used as an adjuvant to BMD in fracture risk assessment. Some individuals with normal BMD or osteopenia have more degraded TBS. This study aimed to identify factors associated with TBS being worse than BMD in the non-osteoporotic elderly population.

- **Methods**: The study subjects were selected from 2,384 women and men aged ≥ 60 years participating in the second stage of the Bushehr Elderly Health Program, a population-based prospective cohort study in Iran. The BMDs of different sites and the lumbar spine texture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the TBS algorithm, respectively. Subjects were categorized based on their BMD and TBS status. Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with "TBS worse than BMD" in non-osteoporotic individuals.

- **Results**: Of 1,335 participants included in the study, 112 of 457 women and 54 of 878 men had worse TBS than BMD. In multivariable analysis, TBS worse than BMD in women was statistically significantly associated with years since menopause (OR: 1.04 (1.00–1.07)) and waist circumference (OR: 1.09 (1.05–1.14)). However, in men, the condition was statistically significantly associated with waist circumference (OR: 1.10 (1.03–1.17)), smoking (OR: 2.54 (1.10–5.84)), and HDL-C (OR: 1.03 (1.00–1.06)).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study show that higher waist circumference is associated with more degraded TBS than BMD in both men and women. Years passed since menopause and smoking were also identified as significant factors.

### Mild hyponatremia is not associated with degradation of trabecular bone microarchitecture despite bone mass loss [^11373Nph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, the impact of hyponatremia on noninvasive indices of bone quality is unknown. This research evaluates whether trabecular bone microarchitecture, assessed noninvasively by trabecular bone score (TBS), is altered in patients with hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the population-based 2005–2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which TBS measurement was performed. The main outcome measures were TBS values and bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.

- **Results**: A total of 4,204 subjects aged 50 years or older were included (4,041 normonatremic and 163 hyponatremic, with 90.8% having mild hyponatremia). Univariate analyses did not show any difference in TBS between patients with and without hyponatremia (1.308 ± 0.145 vs. 1.311 ± 0.141, P = 0.806). Hyponatremic subjects had a lower BMD T-score at the total hip (-0.70 ± 1.46 vs. -0.13 ± 1.32, P < .001) and femoral neck (-1.11 ± 1.26 vs. -0.72 ± 1.14, P = 0.004), while no difference was observed at the lumbar spine (-0.27 ± 1.63 vs. -0.31 ± 1.51, P = 0.772). After adjustment for relevant confounders, hyponatremia was confirmed as an independent predictor of lower BMD T-score at the total hip (β = -0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-0.39, -0.02], P = 0.029), while the significance was lost at the femoral neck (P = 0.308). No association between hyponatremia and lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.236) or TBS (P = 0.346) was observed.

- **Conclusion**: Hyponatremia, at large, does not appear to impact trabecular bone microarchitecture as assessed by TBS, although it is associated with lower BMD T-scores at the total hip.

### Combining frailty and trabecular bone score did not improve predictive accuracy in risk of major osteoporotic fractures [^114NM3uY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

It is recognized that the trabecular bone score (TBS) provides skeletal information, and frailty measurement is significantly associated with increased risks of adverse health outcomes. Given the suboptimal predictive power in fracture risk assessment tools, we aimed to evaluate the combination of frailty and TBS regarding predictive accuracy for the risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF). Data from the prospective longitudinal study of CaMos (Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study) were used for this study. TBS values were estimated using lumbar spine (L1 to L4) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images; frailty was evaluated by a frailty index (FI) of deficit accumulation. The outcome was time to first incident MOF during the follow-up.

We used Harrell's C-index to compare the model predictive accuracy. The Akaike information criterion, likelihood ratio test, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare model performances between the model combining frailty and TBS (subsequently called "FI+TBS"), FI-alone, and TBS-alone models. We included 2730 participants (mean age 69 years; 70% women) for analyses (mean follow-up 7.5 years). There were 243 (8.90%) MOFs observed during follow-up. Participants with MOF had significantly higher FI (0.24 versus 0.20) and lower TBS (1.231 versus 1.285) than those without MOF. FI and TBS were significantly related to MOF risk in the model adjusted for FRAX with bone mineral density (BMD) and other covariates: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.43) for per-SD increase in FI; HR = 1.38 (95%).

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^116RkV8S]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is only one of several bone strength determinants affected by osteoporosis therapies. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), a gray-level texture index determined from lumbar spine (LS) dual X-ray absorptiometry scans, is an indirect measure of bone microarchitecture independent of and complementary to BMD and clinical risk factors. In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH), monthly subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg for 12 months followed by 24-month open-label weekly oral alendronate 70 mg (romosozumab-to-alendronate) significantly reduced fracture risk compared to 36-month alendronate alone in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prior fracture.

This analysis evaluated tissue thickness-adjusted TBS (TBSTT) in a subgroup of patients from ARCH who had post-hoc TBS measurements at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit at months 12, 24, and 36. Baseline characteristics were similar between romosozumab-to-alendronate (n = 190) and alendronate alone (n = 188). Romosozumab led to significantly greater gains in TBSTT versus alendronate at month 12 (least squares mean difference, 3.6%), with greater gains maintained after transition to alendronate and persisting at months 24 (2.9%) and 36 (2.3%; all p < 0.001). Romosozumab-to-alendronate increased the percentage of individual patients with "normal" TBSTT from 28.9% at baseline to 48.1%, 43.9%, and 45.4% at months 12, 24, and 36, respectively, and decreased the percentage of individual patients with degraded TBSTT from 52.6% to 33.3%, 36.0%, and 33.5%, respectively.

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112bw9Gp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

- **Figure 2**: Percentage of patients by TBS TT risk category at baseline and months 12, 24, and 36 in (A) the alendronate alone group and (B) the romosozumab-to-alendronate group. The number of patients (n) with TBS TT measurements at baseline and months 12, 24, and 36 is provided. The p-value is vs. baseline and is based on Bhapkar's test for homogeneity. TBS TT degraded is defined as TBS TT ≤ 1.027; TBS TT partially degraded is TBS TT > 1.027 to ≤ 1.074; TBS TT normal is TBS TT > 1.074. Abbreviations include TBS for trabecular bone score and TBS TT for tissue thickness–adjusted TBS.

Percent changes from baseline in TBS TT were largely unrelated to percent changes from baseline in lumbar spine BMD, with r² = 0.065 at month 12 and r² = 0.058 at month 36 in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group, and r² = 0.021 at month 12 and r² = 0.057 at month 36 in the alendronate alone group. Similar low correlations were observed between TBS BMI and lumbar spine BMD percent changes in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group (r² = 0.027 at month 12; r² = 0.008 at month 36) and in the alendronate alone group (r² = 0.010 at months 12 and 36).

- **Figure 3**: Relationship between lumbar spine BMD and TBS TT percentage change from baseline at months 12 and 36 in (A) the alendronate alone group and (B) the romosozumab-to-alendronate group. The number of patients (n) with BMD and TBS TT measurements at baseline and months 12 or 36 is noted. Pearson correlation results are r² = 0.021 at month 12 and 0.057 at month 36 in the alendronate alone group; and r² = 0.065 at month 12 and 0.058 at month 36 in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group. The percentage of values is shown in each quadrant.

### The initial slope of the variogram, foundation of the trabecular bone score, is not or is poorly associated with vertebral strength [^112L8qLo]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is based on textural analysis of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to reflect the decay in trabecular structure characteristic of osteoporosis. However, its discriminative power in fracture studies remains elusive because prior biomechanical tests found no correlation with vertebral strength. To verify this result, possibly due to an unrealistic setup, and to encompass a wide range of loading scenarios, data from three previous biomechanical studies using different experimental settings were analyzed. These studies involved the compressive failure of 62 human lumbar vertebrae, loaded in various ways:

1. Via intervertebral discs to mimic the in vivo situation ("full vertebra").
2. Via the classical endplate embedding ("vertebral body").
3. Via a ball joint to induce anterior wedge failure ("vertebral section").

High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scans from prior testing were used to simulate anterior-posterior DXA, from which areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and the initial slope of the variogram (ISV) — an early definition of TBS — were evaluated. Finally, the relation of aBMD and ISV with failure load (F(exp)) and apparent failure stress (σexp) was assessed, and their relative contribution to a multilinear model was quantified via ANOVA. Results indicated that, unlike aBMD, ISV did not significantly correlate with F(exp) and σexp, except for the "vertebral body" case (r² = 0.396, p = 0.028). Aside from the "vertebra section" setup, where it explained only 6.4% of σexp (p = 0.037), ISV provided no significant improvement over aBMD.

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112uqMWS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Low credibility.

- **Material and methods**: The study design of the ARCH trial (NCT01631214) has been published. Briefly, ARCH was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 study in 4093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a prior vertebral or hip fracture. In the double-blind study conducted for a duration of 12 months, patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab or a weekly oral dose of 70 mg alendronate.

After completion of the double-blind trial period, all patients received an open-label weekly dose of 70 mg oral alendronate for a period of at least 12 months until the end of the event-driven study, with a median study duration of 2.7 years from patient enrollment. All patients received daily supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.

- **DXA scans**: DXA scans were selected for this TBS TT analysis based on a three-step process. First, among 4093 patients enrolled in the ARCH trial, 1095 patients were eligible for inclusion because they had LS BMD measurements available at baseline and all post-baseline visits (months 12, 24, and 36) and provided consent for DXA scans to be used for future research. Second, of the 1095 patients, a subset of 478 patients (239 in each treatment group) were randomly selected for TBS evaluation. This sample size was determined sufficient to provide enough viable scans to maintain statistical power for hypothesis testing, even with consideration for patients with scans requiring exceptions.
