## Question

Smoking cessation counseling

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about smoking cessation counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational evidence base and how to frame counseling within the broader cessation landscape. Then, I should verify the comparative effectiveness of different counseling modalities and the dose–response relationship. Next, I will examine special populations and settings where counseling is particularly impactful. After that, I need to integrate pharmacotherapy and clarify synergies. Finally, I should translate this into a practical, staged clinical approach and address implementation barriers and uncertainties, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations and that I double-check areas where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the foundational evidence base so I don't overstate anything. The USPSTF gives behavioral counseling a Grade A recommendation for nonpregnant adults, based on hundreds of randomized trials and over 500,000 participants, showing substantial benefit across formats including physician advice, nurse advice, individual counseling, group counseling, telephone counseling, and mobile-based interventions, with no increase in adverse effects identified in trials of behavioral counseling [^111esZGM] [^113ks8Fd]. I should also anchor pharmacotherapy here: first-line medications (NRT, bupropion, varenicline) are effective, and combining behavioral support with pharmacotherapy yields the highest quit rates, with varenicline and combination NRT outperforming single-form NRT in head-to-head trials and meta-analyses [^115ro1Eo] [^1166C5iM].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness of counseling modalities before drawing conclusions. Individual counseling by trained specialists increases quit rates versus minimal contact controls, with a pooled risk ratio around 1.5–1.6 in Cochrane analyses, and the effect persists when pharmacotherapy is not universally provided, though the relative benefit is smaller when all participants receive medication [^11223n3P]. Group therapy also shows benefit versus self-help and brief advice, with moderate-quality evidence, but appears comparable to similarly intensive individual counseling when intensity is matched, so I should be cautious not to overclaim superiority of one format over another without considering dose and context [^111qFJoV]. Telephone counseling, especially proactive multi-call programs, improves quit rates both for quitline callers and in other settings, with meta-analytic risk ratios around 1.25–1.38, and there is some evidence of a dose–response with more calls outperforming one call in certain contexts [^115zDkzE] [^1174mkch]. I need to check digital modalities: tailored, interactive internet programs can modestly improve outcomes versus inactive controls, but evidence versus active comparators is mixed, and real-time video counseling has very limited evidence to date, so I should not overgeneralize here [^116fHuvM] [^115sAaYk].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose–response and intensity claims because they often get overstated. There is consistent evidence that more intensive behavioral support yields higher quit rates than minimal support, with typical effective programs involving at least 4 sessions and 90–300 total minutes of contact, though the incremental gains beyond 6 sessions are less certain and may be modest on average [^115MFNmu]. Meta-analyses of behavioral support added to pharmacotherapy show a small but significant benefit of more intensive support, roughly a 10–25% relative increase in success, with larger effects when the control condition lacks personal contact, reinforcing the dose–response concept while tempering expectations for very large absolute gains at high baselines [^112Crsqf] [^116fgwHj]. But wait, what if comparator variability is masking true effects? Recent meta-regressions that standardize comparators suggest psychologist-delivered individual and group counseling are approximately 2-fold more effective than brief advice and about 1.5-fold more effective than nurse-led counseling when compared against the same reference condition, which helps reconcile heterogeneous findings across trials [^1179xkZV] [^113QcN5u].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings where counseling has particular impact, and I need to ensure I cite the right guidance. In COPD, smoking cessation counseling is the only intervention that slows FEV1 decline and reduces exacerbations; GOLD recommends combining counseling with pharmacotherapy, and observational and randomized data show graded benefits with increasing intensity, from brief counseling to intensive programs, with absolute abstinence rates rising from about 2.6% to 12.3% in some cohorts [^113QaSpR] [^115epZVs] [^1156XKUq]. In cardiovascular care, ACC guidance frames tobacco use as a chronic disease requiring repeated intervention and explicitly endorses combining behavioral support with pharmacotherapy, emphasizing system-level integration and follow-up to sustain abstinence [^113CLR86]. For hospitalized patients, high-certainty evidence shows that counseling initiated in hospital and continued for more than one month after discharge increases quit rates versus no counseling, and adding post-discharge pharmacotherapy further improves outcomes, which argues for mandatory inpatient identification and warm handoffs to outpatient support [^112p5kRa]. In lung cancer screening, both ACS and USPSTF mandate concurrent cessation counseling because quitting is the most effective way to reduce lung cancer mortality even when screening is offered, so I should not miss this opportunity [^113DDktM] [^114UuozE]. For patients with depression, adding behavioral mood management to standard counseling improves quit rates, so I should tailor support accordingly [^112UjCxd].

> I will now examine the synergy between behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy, and I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. The Cochrane review of combined interventions shows high-quality evidence that behavioral support plus medication roughly doubles quit rates compared with brief advice or usual care, with pooled risk ratios around 1.8 and absolute differences approximating 6–8 percentage points at 6 months, and this finding is consistent across multiple settings and populations when comparators are similar [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM]. Let me verify head-to-head pharmacotherapy data to contextualize choices: varenicline and combination NRT achieve the highest 6-month quit rates among first-line options, with varenicline around 27.6% and combination NRT around 31.5% versus placebo near 10.6%, supporting the use of these agents when appropriate and combining with behavioral support to optimize outcomes [^115ro1Eo]. I should confirm that adding behavioral support to medication yields an additional 10–20% relative increase in success; updated Cochrane analyses corroborate a modest but significant incremental benefit of more intensive behavioral support on top of pharmacotherapy, reinforcing the rationale for combined treatment as standard care [^116fgwHj].

> Let me translate this into a practical, staged clinical approach, and I should ensure each step aligns with guidelines. First, I need to screen and assess tobacco use at every visit, quantify dependence (for example, time to first cigarette, cigarettes per day, or Fagerström), and gauge readiness to quit using a stages-of-change framework, because brief advice alone increases quit rates and repeated screening sustains impact over time [^117Qnzfn] [^116DutNE] [^111PfJWE]. Second, I should advise all smokers to quit with clear, personalized health risks and a strong recommendation, as even brief clinician advice improves cessation and is cost-effective at the population level [^117Qnzfn] [^116DutNE]. Third, I need to assist by offering pharmacotherapy to all willing patients, prescribing combination NRT or varenicline preferentially when appropriate, and proactively connecting patients to behavioral support such as individual counseling, quitline referral with callbacks, or group programs, documenting the referral and following up on engagement [^115ro1Eo] [^115cyFq5]. Fourth, I should arrange follow-up within 2–4 weeks to monitor adherence, side effects, and cravings, and continue support for at least three months with additional contacts as needed, recognizing that sustained support reduces relapse risk [^116o2wpn] [^115MFNmu]. If the patient is not ready to quit, I should use motivational interviewing to build readiness, while remembering that evidence for MI is mixed and that simpler education may sometimes perform as well or better in low-motivation populations, so I should tailor the approach and not overcommit to a single technique [^115dxRQf] [^113Qtd3k].

> But wait, what about implementation barriers and real-world effectiveness — I need to check where the gaps are. Despite strong evidence, only about half of smokers report receiving advice to quit during healthcare visits, and disparities persist by insurance, race/ethnicity, age, and comorbidity, indicating a need for system prompts, EMR workflows, and team-based care to normalize cessation treatment [^112GFfvk]. Cost-free medications and adjunctive counseling by allied health professionals improve quit rates in primary care, suggesting that addressing access and workflow can materially change outcomes, and repeated counseling over time is among the most cost-effective preventive services in medicine [^114cgNSn] [^116DutNE]. I should also remember that many smokers attempt to quit unaided and underestimate the benefits of evidence-based treatments, so clinician endorsement and facilitated access can shift behavior toward more effective strategies [^113Af9j4].

> Hold on, I should verify a few areas of uncertainty so I don't overstate conclusions. Motivational interviewing shows modest benefits in some meta-analyses but low-certainty evidence overall, and in low-motivation samples, simpler health education may outperform MI for inducing quit attempts and abstinence, so I should individualize and not assume MI is universally superior [^115dxRQf] [^113Qtd3k]. Relapse prevention interventions after initial quitting have not shown consistent benefit beyond standard support, with the exception of extended varenicline in some trials, so routine add-on relapse programs are not strongly supported pending better evidence [^116gCqdn]. Finally, comparator variability across trials can obscure true differences; standardized meta-regressions suggest larger effects for specialist-delivered counseling than apparent in pairwise comparisons, but replication and careful attention to control conditions remain essential before adopting novel components wholesale [^1179xkZV] [^113QcN5u].

> In summary, I need to ensure my clinical message is precise: behavioral counseling is effective across modalities, intensity matters with at least 4 sessions and 90–300 minutes yielding the most consistent benefits, and combining counseling with pharmacotherapy — especially varenicline or combination NRT — provides the highest likelihood of success, with the greatest absolute benefits in high-risk populations such as those with COPD, cardiovascular disease, and during hospitalization or lung cancer screening, so routine, repeated, and systematized delivery is warranted [^111esZGM] [^115MFNmu] [^112ctX4X] [^115ro1Eo] [^1156XKUq] [^112p5kRa] [^113DDktM].

---

Smoking cessation counseling is a **structured, evidence-based approach** that combines behavioral support with pharmacotherapy to increase quit rates [^115MFNmu] [^112ctX4X]. It includes assessing readiness to quit, setting a quit date, providing coping strategies, and offering follow-up support [^113tep9J] [^115cyFq5] [^116FC5Y3] [^116o2wpn]. Counseling is effective across settings (primary care, hospitals, quitlines) and is most effective when combined with medications such as varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine replacement therapy [^111esZGM] [^112p5kRa] [^115zDkzE] [^115ro1Eo]. Even brief counseling improves quit rates, and more intensive support yields greater benefits [^117Qnzfn] [^11223n3P]. Counseling is recommended for all smokers, including those with comorbidities and during pregnancy, and is cost-effective [^1142Zq5P] [^116DutNE].

---

## Core components of smoking cessation counseling

Effective counseling typically includes the following **core components**:

- **Assessment of readiness to quit**: Evaluate the patient's motivation, confidence, and barriers to quitting [^113umG2g].

- **Setting a quit date**: Establish a specific quit date within the next 2–4 weeks [^115cyFq5].

- **Behavioral strategies**: Provide coping strategies, stress management, and relapse prevention techniques [^116FC5Y3].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Offer nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, or bupropion as appropriate [^115ro1Eo].

- **Follow-up support**: Schedule regular follow-up sessions to monitor progress, address challenges, and provide encouragement [^116o2wpn].

## Effectiveness of smoking cessation counseling

Counseling significantly increases quit rates compared with no intervention or brief advice alone [^11223n3P]. The effectiveness varies by **intensity and modality**:

| **Intervention type** | **Relative risk (RR) of quitting** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Brief physician advice | 1.66 (95% CI 1.42–1.94) | High |
| Individual counseling | 1.57 (95% CI 1.40–1.77) | High |
| Group counseling | 1.88 (95% CI 1.52–2.33) | Moderate |
| Telephone counseling | 1.38 (95% CI 1.19–1.61) | Moderate |
| Combination therapy (counseling + pharmacotherapy) | 1.83 (95% CI 1.68–1.98) | High |

---

Combination therapy — counseling plus pharmacotherapy — is the **most effective approach**, nearly doubling quit rates compared with usual care or brief advice [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM].

---

## Counseling in specific populations and settings

Counseling is effective across diverse populations and settings, including **primary care**, where brief advice and counseling are recommended for all adult smokers [^111esZGM] [^114cgNSn]. In **hospitalized patients**, inpatient counseling with post-discharge follow-up significantly increases quit rates [^112p5kRa]. For **pregnant women**, behavioral counseling is recommended due to substantial benefits for maternal and infant health [^113mJKHY]. In patients with **chronic diseases**, counseling is particularly beneficial for those with cardiovascular disease, COPD, and diabetes [^113CLR86] [^1156XKUq].

---

## Cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation counseling

Smoking cessation counseling is among the most **cost-effective preventive interventions** in healthcare [^116DutNE]. It reduces healthcare costs by decreasing smoking-related illnesses and improving quality of life [^116DutNE].

---

## Barriers and facilitators to effective counseling

Barriers include limited **provider time**, lack of training, patient resistance, and limited access to resources [^notfound]. Facilitators include **provider training**, integration into routine care, use of quitlines, and electronic health record prompts [^114cgNSn] [^116o2wpn].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the importance of smoking cessation counseling:

- **USPSTF**: Strongly recommends behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for all adult smokers [^1142Zq5P].

- **ACC**: Emphasizes routine screening, counseling, and pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation in cardiovascular care [^116o2wpn].

- **GOLD**: Recommends counseling and pharmacotherapy as the most effective treatment for COPD patients who smoke [^115epZVs].

---

Smoking cessation counseling is a **critical component** of tobacco control efforts, significantly increasing quit rates and improving health outcomes. It is effective across populations and settings, particularly when combined with pharmacotherapy, and is recommended by major health organizations worldwide [^1139HV7S].

### Smoking cessation: integration of behavioral and drug therapies [^113tep9J]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians should take advantage of each contact with smokers to encourage and support smoking cessation. Once a patient is identified as a smoker, tools are available to assess readiness for change. Using motivational interviewing techniques, the physician can help the patient move from the precontemplation stage through the contemplation stage to the preparation stage, where plans are made for the initiation of nicotine replacement and/or bupropion therapy when indicated. Continued motivational techniques and support are needed in the action stage, when the patient stops smoking. Group or individual behavioral counseling can facilitate smoking cessation and improve quit rates. Combined use of behavioral and drug therapies can dramatically improve the patient's chance of quitting smoking. A plan should be in place for recycling the patient through the appropriate stages if relapse should occur.

### Smoking cessation [^116GSYy3]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is arguably the major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the developed world. The Department of Health and Human Services in the United States classifies cigarette smoking as a chronic, often relapsing disease. Like most complex diseases, genetic and environmental factors play important roles and contribute to both smoking initiation and persistence. This review summarizes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for smoking cessation and provides references to evidence-based guidelines and support material. As smoking is an etiologic and exacerbating factor for lung diseases, the pulmonary physician should be particularly expert in smoking cessation interventions.

### Behavioural interventions for smoking cessation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111DxnRm]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Widely varying estimates of treatment effects have been reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation. Previous meta-analyses investigating behavioural interventions have important limitations and do not include recently published RCTs. We undertook a meta-analysis of RCTs to synthesize the treatment effects of four behavioural interventions, including minimal clinical intervention (brief advice from a healthcare worker), and intensive interventions, including individual, group, and telephone counselling.

Methods and Results

We searched the CDC Tobacco Information and Prevention, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases. We included only RCTs that reported biochemically validated smoking cessation outcomes at 6 and/or 12 months after the target quit date. Outcomes were aggregated using hierarchical Bayesian random-effects models. We identified 50 RCTs, which randomized n = 26 927 patients (minimal clinical intervention: 9 RCTs, n = 6456; individual counselling: 23 RCTs, n = 8646; group counselling: 12 RCTs, n = 3600; telephone counselling: 10 RCTs, n = 8225). The estimated mean treatment effects were minimal clinical intervention [odds ratio (OR) 1.50, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.84–2.78], individual counselling (OR 1.49, 95% CrI 1.08–2.07), group counselling (OR 1.76, 95% CrI 1.11–2.93), and telephone counselling (OR 1.58, 95% CrI 1.15–2.29).

Conclusion

Intensive behavioural interventions result in substantial increases in smoking abstinence compared with control. Although minimal clinical intervention may increase smoking abstinence, there is insufficient evidence to draw strong conclusions regarding its efficacy.

### Preventive care in the emergency department: diagnosis and management of smoking and smoking-related illness in the emergency department: a systematic review [^116RE7s8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The efficacy of emergency department (ED)-based patient screening and counseling for smoking cessation is not currently known.

Objectives

To perform a structured, systematic review of the medical literature to assess the efficacy of limited screening and counseling for tobacco use cessation among adults in the primary care and ED settings, and develop recommendations for emergency physicians based on these data.

Methods

A two-person template-driven review of all English-language articles from Medline, the Cochrane Database, and two recent smoking cessation guidelines, with evidence graded according to the scheme of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), was performed. Recommendations were developed, and strength graded, based on this evidence.

Results

Of 2,078 citations reviewed, 16 were selected for inclusion, based on their methodologic strength and relevance to emergency medicine. Routine physician screening and counseling may increase quit rates at 6–12 months from 3% (usual care) to 8–11%. Interventions include brief counseling (< 3 minutes), possibly supplemented with self-help literature, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and follow-up telephone calls.

Conclusions

Strong evidence exists, in the primary care setting, that smoking cessation screening and counseling are effective. Limited data exist for ED-based practice, but, based on the burden of disease, relative ease of intervention, and likely efficacy, routine screening of all patients for tobacco use and referral of smokers to primary care and cessation programs are recommended.

### Real-time video counselling for smoking cessation [^115sAaYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Real-time video communication software such as Skype and FaceTime transmits live video and audio over the Internet, allowing counsellors to provide support to help people quit smoking. There are more than four billion Internet users worldwide, and Internet users can download free video communication software, rendering a video counselling approach both feasible and scalable for helping people to quit smoking.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of real-time video counselling delivered individually or to a group in increasing smoking cessation, quit attempts, intervention adherence, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance, and to provide an economic evaluation regarding real-time video counselling.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase to identify eligible studies on 13 August 2019. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials registered by 13 August 2019. We checked the reference lists of included articles and contacted smoking cessation researchers for any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised trials, cluster RCTs or cluster randomised trials of real-time video counselling for current tobacco smokers from any setting that measured smoking cessation at least six months following baseline. The real-time video counselling intervention could be compared with a no intervention control group or another smoking cessation intervention, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from included trials, assessed the risk of bias and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis for the primary outcome of smoking cessation, using the most stringent measure of smoking cessation measured at the longest follow-up. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. We considered participants with missing data at follow-up for the primary outcome of smoking cessation to be smokers.

Main Results

We included two randomised trials with 615 participants. Both studies delivered real-time video counselling for smoking cessation individually, compared with telephone counselling. We judged one study at unclear risk of bias and one study at high risk of bias. There was no statistically significant treatment effect for smoking cessation (using the strictest definition and longest follow-up) across the two included studies when real-time video counselling was compared to telephone counselling (risk ratio (RR) 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 12.04; 2 studies, 608 participants; I² = 66%). We judged the overall certainty of the evidence for smoking cessation as very low due to methodological limitations, imprecision in the effect estimate reflected by the wide 95% CIs and inconsistency of cessation rates. There were no significant differences between real-time video counselling and telephone counselling reported for number of quit attempts among people who continued to smoke (mean difference (MD) 0.50, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.60; 1 study, 499 participants), mean number of counselling sessions completed (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.05; 1 study, 566 participants), completion of all sessions (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.79; 1 study, 43 participants) or therapeutic alliance (MD 1.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 2.50; 1 study, 398 participants). Participants in the video counselling arm were more likely than their telephone counselling counterparts to recommend the programme to a friend or family member (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 398 participants); however, there were no between-group differences on satisfaction score (MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.16 to 2.56; 1 study, 29 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

There is very little evidence about the effectiveness of real-time video counselling for smoking cessation. The existing research does not suggest a difference between video counselling and telephone counselling for assisting people to quit smoking. However, given the very low GRADE rating due to methodological limitations in the design, imprecision of the effect estimate and inconsistency of cessation rates, the smoking cessation results should be interpreted cautiously. High-quality randomised trials comparing real-time video counselling to telephone counselling are needed to increase the confidence of the effect estimate. Furthermore, there is currently no evidence comparing real-time video counselling to a control group. Such research is needed to determine whether video counselling increases smoking cessation.

### Repeated tobacco-use screening and intervention in clinical practice: health impact and cost effectiveness [^116DutNE]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

This report updates 2001 estimates of disease burden prevented and cost effectiveness of tobacco-use screening and brief intervention relative to that of other clinical preventive services. It also addresses repeated counseling because the literature has focused on single episodes of treatment, while in reality that is neither desirable nor likely.

Methods

Literature searches led to four models for calculating the clinically preventable burden of deaths and morbidity from smoking as well as the cost effectiveness of providing the service annually over time. The same methods were used in similar calculations for other preventive services to facilitate comparison.

Results

Using methods consistent with existing literature for this service, an estimated 190,000 undiscounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are saved at a cost of $1100 per QALY saved (discounted). These estimates exclude financial savings from smoking-attributable disease prevented and use the average 12-month quit rate in clinical practice for tobacco screening and brief cessation counseling with cessation medications (5.0%) and without (2.4%). Including the savings of prevented smoking-attributable disease and using the effectiveness of repeated interventions over the lifetime of smokers (23.1%), 2.47 million QALYs are saved at a cost savings of $500 per smoker who receives the service.

Conclusions

This analysis makes repeated clinical tobacco-cessation counseling one of the three most important and cost-effective preventive services that can be provided in medical practice. Greater efforts are needed to achieve more of this potential value by increasing current low levels of performance.

### Behavioural interventions as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation [^112Crsqf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Effective pharmacotherapies are available to help people who are trying to stop smoking, but quitting can still be difficult and providing higher levels of behavioural support may increase success rates further.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of increasing the intensity of behavioural support for people using smoking cessation medications, and to assess whether there are different effects depending on the type of pharmacotherapy, or the amount of support in each condition.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2012 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline that evaluated the addition of personal support or compared two or more intensities of behavioural support.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in which all participants received pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and conditions differed by the amount of behavioural support. Controls could receive less intensive personal contact, or just written information. We did not include studies that used a contact matched control to evaluate differences between types or components of support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by both authors. Data were extracted by one author and checked by the other. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria with over 15,000 participants in the relevant arms. There was very little evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 3%) so all studies were pooled in the main analysis. There was evidence of a small but statistically significant benefit from more intensive support (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24) for abstinence at longest follow-up. All but two of the included studies provided four or more sessions of support. Most trials used nicotine replacement therapy. Significant effects were not detected for studies where the pharmacotherapy was nortriptyline (two trials) or varenicline (one trial), but this reflects the absence of evidence. In subgroup analyses, studies that provided at least four sessions of personal contact for the intervention and no personal contact for the control had slightly larger effects (six trials, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45), as did studies where all intervention counselling was via telephone (six trials, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.41). Weaker evidence for a benefit of providing additional behavioural support was seen in the trials where all participants, including those in the control condition, had at least 30 minutes of personal contact (18 trials, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.25). None of the differences between subgroups were significant, and the last two subgroup analyses were not prespecified. No trials were judged at high risk of bias on any domain.

Authors' Conclusions

Providing behavioural support in person or via telephone for people using pharmacotherapy to stop smoking has a small but important effect. Increasing the amount of behavioural support is likely to increase the chance of success by about 10 to 25%, based on a pooled estimate from 38 trials. A subgroup analysis of a small number of trials suggests the benefit could be a little greater when the contrast is between a no contact control and a behavioural intervention that provides at least four sessions of contact. Subgroup analysis also suggests that there may be a smaller incremental benefit from providing even more intensive support via more or longer sessions over and above some personal contact.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^112TrBYz]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior meta‐analysis of smoking cessation interventions

Many previous meta‐analyses have examined the relative effectiveness of different types of smoking cessation interventions. Whereas most reviews ignore differences in comparators, some have accounted for differences in comparators to some extent using two methods. First are pairwise meta‐analyses in which effect sizes from trials that used different comparators (e.g. no‐intervention controls, self‐help, brief support or intensive individual counselling) to evaluate the effectiveness of one type of intervention (e.g. group interventions) were synthesised separately. These generally reveal that intervention effects become smaller as the comparator was more intensive. Limitations of these meta‐analyses are that they cluster comparators into broad categories (e.g. self‐help, intensive counselling) that can still include substantial variability in active content (i.e. provision of medication and BCTs). Moreover, they cannot compare all possible combinations of experimental and comparator conditions. For example, e‐health intervention trials rarely have intensive individual counselling as comparator, but many trials evaluating experimental group interventions have individual counselling as the comparator. Such meta‐analyses are also left with a limited number of studies when analysing specific combinations of experimental interventions and comparators, decreasing power and precision.

The second method is a network meta‐analysis, including one of behavioural smoking cessation interventions, which was recently published by a co‐author. Although highly informative, this study examined which of 38 individual intervention components were associated with increased smoking cessation (when compared with 'minimal intervention'), but did not look at the impact of differences in comparators between smoking cessation trials on conclusions about their (relative) effectiveness. A relevant limitation of this network meta‐analysis is that it relied on published information about interventions only. Yet, recent studies have found that on average approximately 70% of the information on the active content of behavioural smoking cessation interventions (i.e. BCTs) is not reported, yet predicts smoking cessation outcomes. Taking into account these unpublished data about experimental and comparator interventions is, therefore, likely to provide more valid and precise estimates of the effectiveness of different types of behavioural interventions and their constituent components.

### Relapse prevention interventions for smoking cessation [^115Db3Nr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Several treatments can help smokers make a successful quit attempt, but many initially successful quitters relapse over time. There are interventions designed to help prevent relapse.

Objectives

To assess whether specific interventions for relapse prevention reduce the proportion of recent quitters who return to smoking.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction group trials register in September 2004 for studies mentioning relapse prevention or maintenance in title, abstracts or keywords.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of relapse prevention interventions with a minimum follow up of six months. We included smokers who quit on their own, or were undergoing enforced abstinence, or who were participating in treatment programmes. We included trials that compared relapse prevention interventions to a no intervention control, or that compared a cessation programme with additional relapse prevention components to a cessation programme alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were screened and data extracted by one author and checked by a second. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or referral to a third author.

Main Results

Forty studies met inclusion criteria, but were heterogeneous in terms of populations and interventions. We considered studies that randomized abstainers separately from studies that randomized participants prior to their quit date. We detected no benefit of brief and 'skills-based' relapse prevention interventions for women who had quit smoking due to pregnancy, or for smokers undergoing a period of enforced abstinence. We also failed to detect significant effects in trials in other smokers who had quit on their own or with a formal programme. Amongst trials recruiting smokers and evaluating the effect of additional relapse prevention components we also found no evidence of benefit in any subgroup. We did not find that providing training in skills thought to be needed for relapse avoidance reduced relapse, but most studies did not use experimental designs best suited to the task, and had limited power to detect expected small differences between interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

At the moment there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific intervention for helping smokers who have successfully quit for a short time to avoid relapse. The verdict is strongest for interventions focusing on identifying and resolving tempting situations, as most studies were concerned with these. There is very little research available regarding other approaches. Until more evidence becomes available it may be more efficient to focus resources on supporting the initial cessation attempt rather than on additional relapse prevention efforts.

### Treating tobacco use and dependence: an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for tobacco cessation [^111cNxCr]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The prevention of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality through smoking cessation intervention is among the most vital missions of the chest clinician. This article summarizes the major findings and clinical recommendations of the US Department of Health and Human Services/Public Health Service Guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, which is a comprehensive, evidence-based blueprint for smoking cessation. By becoming fluent in the clinical interventions and by implementing the simple institutional changes described in this article and in the guideline, chest clinicians can more effectively intervene with their patients who smoke.

### Smoking cessation [^114JsYoL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Smoking is a risk factor for the four leading causes of death in the United States, yet 48 million Americans — 24% of the U.S. adult population — continue to smoke. Approximately 70% of people who smoke visit a physician each year, yet only half report ever being advised to quit smoking by their physician. Smoking cessation is difficult due to nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Expert groups such as the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research offer protocols for smoking cessation that primary care physicians can use in their office practice. Recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of smoking cessation has led the U.S. Public Health Service to update the practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence. Pharmacotherapy, which includes nicotine replacement therapy, offers assistance to patients who want to stop smoking. However, the cost of pharmacotherapy may be a barrier for some. Other nonpharmacologic therapies, such as counseling, are also effective.

### A multi-level analysis of non-significant counseling effects in a randomized smoking cessation trial [^115nzDcx]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine, in the context of a trial in which counseling did not improve smoking cessation outcomes, whether this was due to a failure of the conceptual theory identifying treatment targets or the action theory specifying interventions.

Design

Data from a randomized clinical trial of smoking cessation counseling and bupropion SR were submitted to multi-level modeling to test whether counseling influenced real-time reports of cognitions, emotions and behaviors, and whether these targets predicted abstinence.

Setting

Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, Madison, WI.

Participants

A total of 403 adult, daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use. Participants were assigned randomly to receive individual counseling or no counseling and a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill. Cessation counseling was delivered in eight 10-minute sessions focused on bolstering social support, motivation, problem-solving and coping skills.

Measurements

Pre- and post-quit ecological momentary assessments of smoking behavior, smoking triggers, active prevention and coping strategies, motivation to quit, difficulty quitting and reactions to initial lapses.

Findings

Counseling prompted avoidance of access to cigarettes, improved quitting self-efficacy, reduced perceived difficulty of quitting over time and protected against guilt and demoralization following lapses. Results also supported the importance of limiting cigarette access, receiving social support, strong motivation and confidence and easing withdrawal distress during cessation efforts. Quitting self-efficacy and perceived difficulty quitting may partially mediate counseling effects on abstinence.

Conclusions

Smoking cessation counseling may work by supporting confidence about quitting and reducing perceived difficulty quitting. Counseling did not affect other targets that protect against relapse.

### What to do after smoking relapse? A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial of chronic care smoking treatments [^116kHttw]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare effects of three post-relapse interventions on smoking abstinence.

Design

Sequential three-phase multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART).

Setting

Eighteen Wisconsin, USA, primary care clinics.

Participants

A total of 1154 primary care patients (53.6% women, 81.2% White) interested in quitting smoking enrolled from 2015 to 2019; 582 relapsed and were randomized to relapse recovery treatment.

Interventions

In phase 1, patients received cessation counseling and 8weeks nicotine patch. Those who relapsed and agreed were randomized to a phase 2 relapse recovery group: (1) reduction counseling+nicotine mini-lozenges+encouragement to quit starting 1month post-randomization (preparation); (2) repeated encouragement to quit starting immediately post-randomization (recycling); or (3) advice to call the tobacco quitline (control). The first two groups could opt into phase 3 new quit treatment [8weeks nicotine patch+mini-lozenges plus randomization to two treatment factors (skill training and supportive counseling) in a 2×2 design]. Phase 2 and 3 interventions lasted ≤ 15months.

Measurements

The study was powered to compare each active phase 2 treatment with the control on the primary outcome: biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence 14months post initiating phase 2 relapse recovery treatment. Exploratory analyses tested for phase 3 counseling factor effects.

Findings

Neither skill training nor supportive counseling (each on versus off) increased 14-month abstinence rates; skills on versus off 9.3% (14/151) versus 5.2% (8/153), P = 0.19; support on versus off 6.6% (10/152) versus 7.9% (12/152), P = 0.73. Phase 2 preparation did not produce higher 14-month abstinence rates than quitline referral; 3.6% (8/220) versus 2.1% [3/145; risk difference = 1.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.8–5.0%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.5–6.9]. Recycling, however, produced higher abstinence rates than quitline referral; 6.9% (15/217) versus 2.1% (three of 145; risk difference, 4.8%, 95% CI = 0.7–8.9%, OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.0–12.4). Recycling produced greater entry into new quit treatment than preparation: 83.4% (181/217) versus 55.9% (123/220), P < 0.0001.

Conclusions

Among people interested in quitting smoking, immediate encouragement post-relapse to enter a new round of smoking cessation treatment ('recycling') produced higher probability of abstinence than tobacco quitline referral. Recycling produced higher rates of cessation treatment re-engagement than did preparation/cutting down using more intensive counseling and pharmacotherapy.

Offer treatment and connect to resources — "The third step is to offer smoking cessation treatment, which translates into providing a pharmacotherapy prescription and actively connecting the patient to behavioral support resources", and patients "are encouraged to set a quit date, usually within the next month, to provide a structure for the quit attempt". Under pharmacotherapy, "Pharmacotherapy should be offered to every patient who is willing to accept it, with rare exceptions", and "It can also be started even in patients who are not ready to quit smoking immediately, because it can help motivate patients to reduce their smoking and increase the odds of them eventually making a quit attempt"; "Prescriptions should be written even for over-the-counter medications" to support coverage, reinforcement, and documentation. For behavioral support, "Either the clinician or office staff should proactively connect a smoker to his/her preferred form of behavioral support", and "Studies have shown that a clinician's active referral to a behavioral support program for smoking cessation is more effective than simply providing advice or information about these".

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^114ZX51v]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

The active content of smoking cessation interventions and comparators

In smoking cessation trials, interventions can be roughly divided into three components: (1) smoking cessation medication; (2) smoking cessation behavioural support, including smoking cessation information and motivational/behaviour planning techniques; and (3) adjuvant interventions that focus on smoking cessation indirectly, for example, through relaxation techniques or weight management. These interventions can be delivered in‐person (individually, group) or in writing (e.g. leaflets, websites), by different providers (e.g. counsellors, nurses and physicians), and vary in terms of content (i.e. the behaviour change techniques [BCTs] used [such as goal setting or self‐monitoring], individually tailored or not, and the behaviours targeted) and exposure times (i.e. the number and duration of smoking cessation sessions). Smoking cessation interventions — experimental and comparators — may therefore, vary from very brief, simple and cheap (such as an information leaflet) to intensive, sophisticated and resource‐intensive group interventions delivered by highly qualified staff over an extensive time period.

In a previous meta‐analysis of 141 smoking cessation trials (a subset of the studies included in the current meta‐analysis), we examined whether variability in smoking cessation support provided to comparator groups, predicted comparator group cessation rates. We indeed found that both medication provision and number of BCTs delivered to comparator group participants predicted smoking cessation and explained up to 15% point differences in cessation rates between comparator groups (range, 8%–23%). There is, therefore, good reason to suspect that accounting for this variability in comparators should lead to more valid comparisons of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions across trials.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112UmP1x]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

We did not compare results from different cessation medications directly, due to the fact that few head‐to‐head comparisons were available.

Length of treatment with medication and type of behavioural counseling may contribute to length of cessation success. We did not evaluate these or other potential modifiers.

Implications

The common practice of providing RRs or ORs at single or composite time‐points to describe effectiveness of smoking cessation medications 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 26 does not inform providers and policymakers fully about the benefits of smoking cessation medications at the individual and population levels.
Clinicians and policymakers should be aware that the public health benefits of smoking cessation medications are considerably smaller than those indicated by the risk difference at 6 months and diminish over time, most intervention group participants are smokers at 1 year and only a small proportion of intervention arm participants benefit in the long term from the medications. Nevertheless, even these small effects confer important long‐term benefits of public health significance.
Researchers and/or reviewers should collect and report on quit rates at various time‐points, including long‐term end‐points of at least 1 year and preferably much longer; report on RDs and quit rates in addition to RRs; strive to minimize attrition rates among study participants, and report numbers of participants followed‐up at every time‐point.
Statistical software used for meta‐analysis should provide straightforward procedures for calculating intervention group‐specific, appropriately weighted RDs and quit rates for each time‐point.
Improved smoking cessation strategies, with supportive environments for promotion of cessation and prevention of relapse, are needed urgently to help millions of smokers quit smoking permanently.

### Physician advice for smoking cessation [^117Qnzfn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Healthcare professionals frequently advise patients to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions.

Objectives

The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation, and to determine the effect of anti-smoking advice on disease-specific and all-cause mortality.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: September 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomization and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up. We also considered the effect of advice on mortality where long-term follow-up data were available. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow up were counted as smokers. Effects were expressed as relative risks. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.

Main Results

We identified 41 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2007, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, subjects were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics. Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) detected a significant increase in the rate of quitting (relative risk (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 1.94). Amongst 11 trials where the intervention was judged to be more intensive the estimated effect was higher (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.13) but there was no statistical difference between the intensive and minimal subgroups. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.56). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow-up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. This study found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow up.

Authors' Conclusions

Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.

### Stage-based interventions for smoking cessation [^111PfJWE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The transtheoretical model is the most widely known of several stage-based theories of behaviour. It proposes that smokers move through a discrete series of motivational stages before they quit successfully. These are precontemplation (no thoughts of quitting), contemplation (thinking about quitting), preparation (planning to quit in the next 30 days), action (quitting successfully for up to six months), and maintenance (no smoking for more than six months). According to this influential model, interventions which help people to stop smoking should be tailored to their stage of readiness to quit, and are designed to move them forward through subsequent stages to eventual success. People in the preparation and action stages of quitting would require different types of support from those in precontemplation or contemplation.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to test the effectiveness of stage-based interventions in helping smokers to quit.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('stage* of change', 'transtheoretical model', 'trans-theoretical model*, 'precaution adoption model', 'health action model', 'processes of change questionnaire', 'readiness to change', 'tailor') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. The latest search was in August 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials, which compared stage-based interventions with non-stage-based controls, with 'usual care' or with assessment only. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment, and those which measured stage of change but did not modify their intervention in the light of it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the dose and duration of intervention, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome was abstinence from smoking for at least six months. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to estimate a pooled risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found 41 trials (> 33,000 participants) which met our inclusion criteria. Four trials, which directly compared the same intervention in stage-based and standard versions, found no clear advantage for the staging component. Stage-based versus standard self-help materials (two trials) gave a relative risk (RR) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.39). Stage-based versus standard counselling (two trials) gave a relative risk of 1.00 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.22). Six trials of stage-based self-help systems versus any standard self-help support demonstrated a benefit for the staged groups, with an RR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.59). Twelve trials comparing stage-based self help with 'usual care' or assessment-only gave an RR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). Thirteen trials of stage-based individual counselling versus any control condition gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.42). These findings are consistent with the proven effectiveness of these interventions in their non-stage-based versions. The evidence was unclear for telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of doctors or lay supporters. This uncertainty may be due in part to smaller numbers of trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on four trials using direct comparisons, stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents. Thirty-one trials of stage-based self help or counselling interventions versus any control condition demonstrated levels of effectiveness which were comparable with their non-stage-based counterparts. Providing these forms of practical support to those trying to quit appears to be more productive than not intervening. However, the additional value of adapting the intervention to the smoker's stage of change is uncertain. The evidence is not clear for other types of staged intervention, including telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes and training of physicians or lay supporters. The evidence does not support the restriction of quitting advice and encouragement only to those smokers perceived to be in the preparation and action stages.

### Screening for lung cancer: 2023 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113DDktM]. CA (2023). High credibility.

Smoking cessation within lung cancer screening — this guideline emphasizes smoking-cessation counseling and offering interventions to quit for persons who currently smoke as part of LCS discussions; among persons who currently smoke, quitting smoking is the most effective way to lower lung cancer risk and combining smoking cessation with LCS is the optimal strategy to reduce risk of dying from lung cancer; overall, normal LCS findings do not appear to provide reassurance that people who smoke or formerly smoked are immune to the harmful effects of smoking.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation [^112ctX4X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recommended where possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention or usual care, and to identify whether there are different effects depending on characteristics of the treatment setting, intervention, population treated, or take-up of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2015 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data was extracted by one author and checked by another. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited people in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by specialists in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact was typically more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health Study) contributed heterogeneity due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95% CI 3.35 to 4.50). Since this study used a particularly intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group sessions and long term maintenance and recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other studies, and hence it was not pooled in other analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I² = 36%). The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for eight trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous weak evidence of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by motivation to quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increase smoking cessation success compared to a minimal intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified treatment effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive behavioural support was associated with larger treatment effects.

### Variability and effectiveness of comparator group interventions in smoking cessation trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144xem1]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of premature mortality, disease and health‐care expenditures 1, 2. Numerous smoking cessation interventions have been developed and their evidence synthesized in systematic reviews, including multiple Cochrane reviews 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The evidence generated has informed smoking cessation guidelines and health‐care services and helped numerous people to quit smoking 12, 13. Accurate evidence can optimize the effectiveness of these interventions and ensure that services offered are those which are most cost‐effective.

The effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions is commonly determined by comparing them with an active control. As such, the observed effect sizes will be a function of the effectiveness of the intervention provided to the experimental group, but also the intervention provided to the corresponding control group, or 'comparator group', as well as of other variables. Study aims vary from trial to trial, and the type of comparator employed should covary with these aims 14. At the most minimal, comparator groups receive no support and simply report their outcomes (which, arguably, could be considered very brief support in itself) 15. At the most intensive, comparator groups might receive many counselling sessions. Systematic reviews of behavioral interventions tend to either ignore the variability in comparator interventions or try to address it by organizing comparator groups into broad categories, such as no behavioral support, self‐help [e.g. pamphlets, self‐directed workbooks, applications (apps)], brief advice/counselling (e.g. a short, typically less than 30 minutes, amount of advice/counselling), extended counselling (longer, often multiple sessions, of counselling), usual care (any support already typically delivered in practice) and/or some combination of these categories 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This approach might not fully account for the variability between comparator groups, as evidence from other areas shows that intervention content delivered to 'usual care' groups can vary considerably between trials 16. In a previous systematic review of HIV medication adherence interventions, this variability in usual care content explained up to 34% points differences in the clinical outcomes observed in the comparator groups and influenced trial effect sizes 16, 17. This suggests that, without accounting for the differences in the intervention content provided to comparator groups, it might not be possible to directly synthesize experimental intervention effects from these trials. Further, for readers of these trials — such as those assessing whether a given intervention will improve outcomes over their current practice — it might also not be possible to interpret, compare or generalize the results.

### Smoking cessation: it is never too late [^1132T6vR]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A CHALLENGE TO HEALTH WORKERS TO HELP SMOKERS QUIT

According to recent Cochrane reports, simple advice by physicians and other health workers has often a small effect on cessation rates, but can have a large impact on a broader scale if offered to many smokers. Additional maneuvers appear to have only a small effect, although more intensive interventions are marginally more effective than minimal interventions. Groups for smoking cessation are better than self-help and other less intensive intervention. There is not enough evidence on their effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness, compared with intensive individual counseling. The inclusion of skills training to help smokers avoid relapse appears to be useful, although the evidence is limited. These interventions should be supported by modern effective drug therapy, with more intensity the higher the risk in the individual patient.

Finally, according to the most recently released U.S. guidelines, it is stated that 1) both counseling and medications should be provided whenever possible, 2) there is stronger evidence than before that counseling is a critical part of tobacco cessation, and lastly 3) individual, group, and telephone counseling are effective, and their effectiveness increases with treatment intensity. Physicians are commonly not experts in education and counseling why there is a need to engage all members of the health care team to do better for achieving smoking cessation in their at-risk patients, especially in those with diabetes. This strategy also includes the important activities of health educators, nurses, and pharmacists, to name a few.

### Individual behavioural counselling for smoking cessation [^11223n3P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Individual counselling from a smoking cessation specialist may help smokers to make a successful attempt to stop smoking.

Objectives

The review addresses the following hypotheses:1. Individual counselling is more effective than no treatment or brief advice in promoting smoking cessation.2. Individual counselling is more effective than self-help materials in promoting smoking cessation.3. A more intensive counselling intervention is more effective than a less intensive intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies with counsel* in any field in May 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized trials with at least one treatment arm consisting of face-to-face individual counselling from a healthcare worker not involved in routine clinical care. The outcome was smoking cessation at follow-up at least six months after the start of counselling.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors extracted data in duplicate. We recorded characteristics of the intervention and the target population, method of randomization and completeness of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically-validated rates where available. In analysis, we assumed that participants lost to follow-up continued to smoke. We expressed effects as a risk ratio (RR) for cessation. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model. We assessed the quality of evidence within each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 49 trials with around 19,000 participants. Thirty-three trials compared individual counselling to a minimal behavioural intervention. There was high-quality evidence that individual counselling was more effective than a minimal contact control (brief advice, usual care, or provision of self-help materials) when pharmacotherapy was not offered to any participants (RR 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 1.77; 27 studies, 11,100 participants; I² = 50%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) of a benefit of counselling when all participants received pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy) (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.51; 6 studies, 2662 participants; I² = 0%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) for a small benefit of more intensive counselling compared to brief counselling (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.53; 11 studies, 2920 participants; I² = 48%). None of the five other trials that compared different counselling models of similar intensity detected significant differences.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that individually-delivered smoking cessation counselling can assist smokers to quit. There is moderate-quality evidence of a smaller relative benefit when counselling is used in addition to pharmacotherapy, and of more intensive counselling compared to a brief counselling intervention.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115epZVs]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD smoking cessation — treatment should be adapted to individual needs and the level of tobacco dependence, and there is evidence that a combination of counseling and pharmacotherapy is the most effective smoking cessation treatment for people with COPD; assessment of nicotine dependence should be carried out for all patients, with indicators of high dependence including smoking within 30 min of waking up, smoking at night, consuming ≥ 20 cigarettes per day, a score of 7 to 10 on the Fagerström scale or 5 to 6 on the Heaviness of Smoking Index; legislative smoking bans are effective in increasing quit rates and reducing harm from second-hand smoke exposure.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1169Z77H]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Smoking cessation counseling and advice — epidemiological analyses show that former smokers have a reduced risk of stroke compared with active smokers and that smoking cessation is associated with a reduction in stroke risk; meta-analyses of randomized trials demonstrate counseling and advice interventions are effective versus no or minimal interventions, including repeated telephone or face-to-face contact and even a 30-second physician intervention, and at minimum, counseling and advice should be provided to all smokers to increase the odds of smoking cessation.

### Stakeholder research priorities for smoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening programs. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115s5LM6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement — stakeholder research priorities for smoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening programs notes that smoking cessation counseling in conjunction with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening is recommended in multiple clinical practice guidelines, but the best approach for integrating effective smoking cessation interventions within this setting is unknown. Objectives were to summarize evidence, identify research gaps, prioritize topics for future research, and propose standardized tools for use in conducting research on smoking cessation interventions within the LDCT lung cancer screening setting. Methods convened a multistakeholder committee with expertise in tobacco dependence treatment and/or LDCT screening to review evidence, identify research gaps, and generate key questions for three domains — target population to study, adaptation, development, and testing of interventions, and implementation of interventions with demonstrated efficacy — and also identified standardized measures for this research. A larger stakeholder panel then ranked research questions by perceived importance in an online survey, and final prioritization was generated hierarchically on the basis of average rank assigned. Results indicated little consensus on highest priority questions in the population domain; within the intervention domain, research to evaluate the effectiveness in the lung cancer screening setting of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions shown to be effective in other contexts was ranked highest; and in the implementation domain, stakeholders prioritized understanding strategies to identify and overcome barriers to integrating smoking cessation in lung cancer screening settings. Conclusions state that the statement offers an agenda to stimulate research surrounding the integration and implementation of smoking cessation interventions within LDCT lung cancer screening.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113CLR86]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco cessation treatment pathway — key points emphasize that tobacco use, especially cigarette smoking, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-associated morbidity and mortality, and that the reversible relationship between cigarette smoking and CVD provides a strong rationale for healthcare providers — especially the CV care team — to make the routine delivery of tobacco cessation treatment a standard component of CV care. Cigarette smoking is described as a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine; most smokers pass through repeated cycles of short-term abstinence followed by relapse to smoking before achieving long-term tobacco abstinence, so treating tobacco dependence requires clinicians to adopt a chronic disease management strategy, monitoring tobacco use over time and making repeated efforts to encourage and assist smokers to quit using tobacco. Current evidence strongly supports combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral/psychosocial interventions as the most effective way to help smokers sustain abstinence; pharmacological therapies help smokers adjust to the absence of nicotine by lessening the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, and behavioral and psychosocial treatments attempt to bolster smokers' self-control over their smoking. Provider and system barriers in implementing and sustaining smoking cessation treatment need to be recognized and addressed to improve the smoking cessation care in the clinical setting.

### Behavioural interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis [^113iikQR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta-analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost-effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary.

Methods

This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self-help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta-analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta-regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components.

Main Results

We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta-analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high-certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair-wise meta-analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate-certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair-wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low-to very low-certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.

Authors' Conclusions

Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost-effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed.

### National trends in cessation counseling, prescription medication use, and associated costs among US adult cigarette smokers [^115CkAcN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite the considerable decrease in smoking prevalence since the release more than 50 years ago of the first US Surgeon General's report on the health implications of cigarette smoking. An estimated 480 0000 US residents die of smoking-related illnesses each year. Overall, smoking costs the nation at least $130 billion in medical care and more than $150 billion in lost productivity annually. Consequently, federally sponsored programs, like Medicare, and private health plans have an enormous economic burden. An estimated 60% of the US health care spending attributable to cigarette smoking is paid by public programs.

Smoking cessation substantially reduces smoking-related morbidity and mortality. When used separately or in combination, smoking cessation counseling and cessation pharmacotherapies are associated with higher cessation rates. Even brief cessation advice or counseling by health care professionals has been associated with effectiveness. Thus, clinical guidelines recommend that smoking cessation counseling be addressed at every clinical visit.

In the United States, 7 US Food and Drug Administration–approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are available, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as well as bupropion hydrochloride and varenicline tartrate. The NRTs are available over the counter (OTC), but the 2 non-NRT medications are prescription only. Although each of these agents is more efficacious than placebo in smoking cessation, clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated superior efficacy of prescription non-NRT, especially varenicline, as compared with OTC NRT. Thus, the 2018 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Tobacco Cessation Treatment guidelines recommend prescription varenicline as the first-line pharmacotherapeutic agent for smoking cessation. Nonetheless, data are lacking on trends in the uptake of prescription smoking cessation therapies, and their associated costs, among the general population of US adult smokers.

The objective of this study was to present the 10-year trends in physician advice to quit smoking and prescription smoking cessation medication use along with their associated total and out-of-pocket expenditures in a nationally representative sample of adult active smokers in the United States.

### Hospital-and clinic-based smoking cessation interventions for smokers with cardiovascular disease [^116aLhRh]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Large observational epidemiologic studies conducted in diverse populations have demonstrated a strong association between smoking and CVD morbidity and mortality. Observational epidemiologic studies have also demonstrated a substantial benefit of smoking cessation on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Smoking cessation after myocardial infarction reduces subsequent cardiovascular mortality by nearly 50%. Therefore, the use of effective strategies to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use is a high priority for both the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Effective smoking cessation interventions have been identified in randomized controlled trials in the general population of smokers. These methods, which include behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy, are incorporated into clinical practice guidelines for physicians in the United States and Great Britain. A smaller but still substantial body of evidence demonstrates the efficacy of these interventions in hospital- and clinic-based settings for smokers with CVD. This evidence is sufficient to support the routine implementation of these smoking cessation methods in inpatient and outpatient settings for smokers with CVD.

### Behavioral health and tobacco cessation… [^112GdM3F]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

To ensure comprehensive smoking interventions, medical practices need to establish a team-based system to implement the following: 29 Behavioral health care incorporates mental health care, substance abuse care, health behavior change, and attention to family and other psychosocial factors into its umbrella. 31 The integration of behavioral health care into primary care is instrumental in effective tobacco dependence treatment. The American Academy of Family Physicians encourages family physicians to use interventions drawn from behavioral health care to address tobacco and nicotine dependence. Recommended interventions include motivational interviewing, brief interventions, 32 and group visits. 33 The following AAFP resources provide information about the use of motivational interviewing and other behavioral health care interventions in tobacco dependence treatment:

In addition to AAFP resources, the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center offers a number of tobacco and tobacco cessation-related resources in the area of behavioral health. The evidence-based interventions described in these resources can be used with any patient who smokes, not just patients who have a behavioral health disorder. However, counseling and pharmacotherapy must be tailored to the needs of the individual patient. Patients who have a behavioral health disorder will often require more time to prepare to quit, more medical management, more intensive follow up, and closer medication monitoring than other patients. Counseling is critical to the success of tobacco dependence treatment. Both individual and group counseling can be effective to support cessation in patients who have a behavioral health disorder. Intensive behavioral therapy with longer and more frequent sessions is often necessary.

Counseling should include problem-solving skills training with specific discussions about what to do in certain situations. Both should also include reassurance that the health care team will provide ongoing support and encouragement. Using motivational interviewing and the Five R's system can also be effective. This system is targeted at patients who use tobacco and are not yet ready to quit. It can motivate change by helping them understand the importance of quitting in personal terms. Relevance. Why is quitting relevant to this patient. For example, maybe he or she has had a personal health scare, such as a recent heart attack, or has a child who has asthma. Roadblocks. Ask the patient to identify barriers to quitting. Then, talk about ways to address these barriers. For example, if a patient is worried about withdrawal symptoms, ease his or her fears by describing medication options that can help. Repetition.

The health care team should repeatedly follow up with the patient, keeping in mind that it may take repeated attempts to quit, especially for patients with a behavioral health disorder. 28.

### Smoking cessation counseling: a practice management perspective [^1116bsqX]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Individuals continue to smoke despite its numerous proven adverse health effects. Now viewed as a chronic medical condition, health-care professionals are more involved in cessation efforts. Physicians are often the first line of defense, providing intervention through prescription management and counseling. Some insurers recognize these efforts as health promoting and cost saving, revising policies to include reimbursement. This article addresses the most recent smoking cessation policy revision implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

### A new curriculum using active learning methods and standardized patients to train residents in smoking cessation [^1169zogR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Physicians can play a key role in smoking cessation but often fail to advise smokers effectively, mainly because they lack counseling skills. We need effective training programs starting during residency to improve physicians' smoking cessation interventions and smokers' quit rates. To achieve this goal, we developed a curriculum using active learning methods and the stages-of-change model. A randomized trial demonstrated that this program increased the quality of physician's counseling and smokers' quit rates at 1 year. This paper describes the educational content and methods of this program. Participants learn to assess smokers' stage of change, to use counseling strategies matching the smoker's stage, and to prescribe pharmacological therapy. This 2 half-day training program includes observation of video-clips, interactive workshops, role plays, practice with standardized patients, and written material for physicians and patients. Participants reached learning objectives and appreciated the content and active methods of the program.

### Quitlines and other cessation support resources… [^1164wnen]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Quitlines may help with the following:

- Overcoming some of the barriers to seeking treatment.
- Offering other services, such as web- and text-based interventions.
- Increasing a person's chances of successfully quitting. Quitlines also offer information and support for family, friends, and health care professionals who want to help people quit using tobacco. Are quitlines effective in helping people quit. Yes. Quitlines are effective and evidence based. The 2008 Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence recommends quitlines as effective in helping people quit. The 2020 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking Cessation concluded proactive quitline counseling, either alone or in combination with cessation medications, increases smoking cessation. Quitlines are also cost effective.

Numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses have helped establish the evidence base for tobacco cessation quitlines. A meta-analysis in the 2008 Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline found quitlines increase six-month smoking cessation quit rates compared with no intervention. In this analysis, the six-month quit rate for quitline counseling alone was 12. 7% and in combination with medication was
28. 1%. If a caller is interested in receiving cessation counseling from the quitline, they will typically be transferred to a tobacco cessation counselor. Cessation counselors are highly trained professionals who are skilled in motivational interviewing and client-centered interventions. Counseling may include:

- Creating a tailored quit plan.
- Providing medication decision support or education on how to use cessation medications.
- Discussing tips and tools for coping with withdrawal, triggers, and cravings.

If the quitline is experiencing heavy call volume, a cessation counselor may not be immediately available. In these cases, the quitline will schedule a call-back time with the caller. Quitlines can help your patients quit smoking Combined with health care provider support, calling a toll-free quitline can help patients quit smoking for good. Refer your patients who smoke to your state quitline through 1–800-QUIT-NOW. Quitlines support patients who want to quit smoking When your patients who smoke call a quitline, trained counselors will help them build a quit plan, discuss medications, and connect them to other free resources to help them quit. Refer your patients who smoke to your state quitline through 1–800-QUIT-NOW.

### The efficacy of smoking cessation interventions in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116htTG5]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, approximately 80% of the current tobacco users reside in LMICs. Addressing tobacco use in these regions is critical in the global efforts to reduce harm from tobacco exposure. We found some evidence to support the efficacy of NRT and behavioral counseling interventions compared to brief advice or usual care. Limited studies were available on other pharmacological agents or m‐Health approaches for smoking cessation intervention in these regions. Continued research on novel, cost‐effective and wide‐reaching interventions are needed to treat the growing population of smokers and prevent the projected 1 billion tobacco‐attributable deaths in this century 60.

### National trends in cessation counseling, prescription medication use, and associated costs among US adult cigarette smokers [^112GFfvk]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the 10-year trends in the delivery of cigarette smoking cessation services for adult smokers in the United States?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 29 106 US adult smokers from 2006 to 2015, the proportion who reported receiving physician advice to quit smoking increased and the use of prescription cessation medication decreased with a corresponding reduction in expenditures. Lower rates of cessation services were observed in certain populations, including men, younger adults, uninsured individuals, racial/ethnic minority groups, and those without smoking-related comorbidities.

Meaning

The disparities in the delivery of known smoking cessation services among certain subgroups may be associated with higher smoking rates despite an all-time low prevalence of smoking, suggesting the call for a more targeted implementation of smoking cessation guidelines.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^116FC5Y3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Behavioral interventions for nicotine dependence — examples and definitions include cognitive behavioral skills training that provides instructions, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback to teach smokers how to change their smoking behavior, with strategies such as self‑monitoring to identify triggers for smoking, behavioral rehearsals like practice quit attempts, and instruction on how to use medications properly to increase medication adherence and quit rates. Motivational interviewing is a goal‑oriented, client‑centered counseling style that aims to elicit behavior change by helping smokers explore and resolve ambivalence, relying on counselors eliciting from clients their own motivations for change rather than imposing a treatment plan. Incentives, usually provided as cash or vouchers, can be used to motivate smokers to try to quit and to reward them for making changes in their smoking behaviors.

### Telephone counselling for smoking cessation [^115zDkzE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Telephone services can provide information and support for smokers. Counselling may be provided proactively or offered reactively to callers to smoking cessation helplines.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of telephone support to help smokers quit, including proactive or reactive counselling, or the provision of other information to smokers calling a helpline.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP for studies of telephone counselling, using search terms including 'hotlines' or 'quitline' or 'helpline'. Date of the most recent search: May 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which offered proactive or reactive telephone counselling to smokers to assist smoking cessation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We pooled studies using a random-effects model and assessed statistical heterogeneity amongst subgroups of clinically comparable studies using the I 2 statistic. In trials including smokers who did not call a quitline, we used meta-regression to investigate moderation of the effect of telephone counselling by the planned number of calls in the intervention, trial selection of participants that were motivated to quit, and the baseline support provided together with telephone counselling (either self-help only, brief face-to-face intervention, pharmacotherapy, or financial incentives).

Main Results

We identified 104 trials including 111,653 participants that met the inclusion criteria. Participants were mostly adult smokers from the general population, but some studies included teenagers, pregnant women, and people with long-term or mental health conditions. Most trials (58.7%) were at high risk of bias, while 30.8% were at unclear risk, and only 11.5% were at low risk of bias for all domains assessed. Most studies (100/104) assessed proactive telephone counselling, as opposed to reactive forms. Among trials including smokers who contacted helplines (32,484 participants), quit rates were higher for smokers receiving multiple sessions of proactive counselling (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.61; 14 trials, 32,484 participants; I² = 72%) compared with a control condition providing self-help materials or brief counselling in a single call. Due to the substantial unexplained heterogeneity between studies, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate. In studies that recruited smokers who did not call a helpline, the provision of telephone counselling increased quit rates (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.35; 65 trials, 41,233 participants; I² = 52%). Due to the substantial unexplained heterogeneity between studies, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate. In subgroup analysis, we found no evidence that the effect of telephone counselling depended upon whether or not other interventions were provided (P = 0.21), no evidence that more intensive support was more effective than less intensive (P = 0.43), or that the effect of telephone support depended upon whether or not people were actively trying to quit smoking (P = 0.32). However, in meta-regression, telephone counselling was associated with greater effectiveness when provided as an adjunct to self-help written support (P < 0.01), or to a brief intervention from a health professional (P = 0.02); telephone counselling was less effective when provided as an adjunct to more intensive counselling. Further, telephone support was more effective for people who were motivated to try to quit smoking (P = 0.02). The findings from three additional trials of smokers who had not proactively called a helpline but were offered telephone counselling, found quit rates were higher in those offered three to five telephone calls compared to those offered just one call (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.44; 2602 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that proactive telephone counselling aids smokers who seek help from quitlines, and moderate-certainty evidence that proactive telephone counselling increases quit rates in smokers in other settings. There is currently insufficient evidence to assess potential variations in effect from differences in the number of contacts, type or timing of telephone counselling, or when telephone counselling is provided as an adjunct to other smoking cessation therapies. Evidence was inconclusive on the effect of reactive telephone counselling, due to a limited number studies, which reflects the difficulty of studying this intervention.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1156XKUq]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Smoking cessation counseling in COPD — counseling by clinicians increases quit rates, brief counseling helps, and a study reports graded one-year abstinence outcomes by counseling intensity and pharmacotherapy. Counseling delivered by physicians and other health professionals significantly increases quit rates over self-initiated strategies, and even brief (3-minute) periods of counseling urging a smoker to quit improve smoking cessation rates. In COPD, a network meta-analysis showed a trend for smoking cessation counseling alone to be superior than usual care. Another study reported a continuous one-year abstinence rate of 1.4% for usual care, 2.6% for minimal counseling (< 90 min), 6% for intensive counseling (≥ 90 min), and 12.3% for intensive counseling plus pharmacotherapy, although controversy remains as to whether more intensive individual counseling is more effective when combined with pharmacotherapy.

### Nonpharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation: characteristics and efficacy of current approaches [^113gVvfs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most common nonpharmacologic approaches used to support smoking cessation and, where possible, provides estimates of their efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Virtually all of the approaches that have been systematically evaluated to date have demonstrated modest efficacy in increasing quit rates. A cornerstone of effective treatment is tobacco dependence counseling, for which there is a dose-response relation between the intensity of counseling (total minutes of contact) and its effectiveness. New approaches in which treatment is tailored to individual patient characteristics appear promising for the future but require further study. Also, new technologies that permit delivery of smoking interventions to a wider range of patients could have a significant impact on reducing smoking prevalence worldwide in the future. Overall, the clinical literature strongly endorses combining nonpharmacologic interventions with pharmacotherapy to optimize support for smokers who are trying to quit.

### Nursing interventions for smoking cessation [^115B78iS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Healthcare professionals, including nurses, frequently advise patients to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of nursing-delivered smoking cessation interventions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialized register and CINAHL in July 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of smoking cessation interventions delivered by nurses or health visitors with follow up of at least six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where statistically and clinically appropriate, we pooled studies using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model and reported the outcome as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one studies comparing a nursing intervention to a control or to usual care found the intervention to significantly increase the likelihood of quitting (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.38). There was heterogeneity among the study results, but pooling using a random effects model did not alter the estimate of a statistically significant effect. In a subgroup analysis there was weaker evidence that lower intensity interventions were effective (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.62). There was limited indirect evidence that interventions were more effective for hospital inpatients with cardiovascular disease than for inpatients with other conditions. Interventions in non-hospitalized patients also showed evidence of benefit. Nine studies comparing different nurse-delivered interventions failed to detect significant benefit from using additional components. Five studies of nurse counselling on smoking cessation during a screening health check, or as part of multifactorial secondary prevention in general practice (not included in the main meta-analysis) found nursing intervention to have less effect under these conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

The results indicate the potential benefits of smoking cessation advice and/or counselling given by nurses to patients, with reasonable evidence that intervention is effective. The evidence of an effect is weaker when interventions are brief and are provided by nurses whose main role is not health promotion or smoking cessation. The challenge will be to incorporate smoking behaviour monitoring and smoking cessation interventions as part of standard practice, so that all patients are given an opportunity to be asked about their tobacco use and to be given advice and/or counselling to quit along with reinforcement and follow up.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^1137GPPp]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

COPD guideline — smoking cessation to prevent acute exacerbations: In patients with COPD, "we suggest including smoking cessation counseling and treatment using best practices as a component of a comprehensive clinical strategy to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2C)". Supporting evidence includes a Department of Veterans Affairs cohort of 23,971 in which cessation was "associated with a reduced risk for COPD exacerbations (adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87)", with duration effects where "quit ≥ 10 years, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.58–0.74]; linear trend P < .001". A randomized trial found a high-intensity cessation strategy achieved higher continuous abstinence "19% vs 9%, respectively; relative risk, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.06–4.65; p = 0.03" and lower utilization with "lower cost ($581 vs $695)", "a lower average number of exacerbations (0.38 vs 0.60)", and "a reduced number of hospital days (0.39 vs 1.00) per patient". In a single-center trial of "223" hospitalized smokers with COPD exacerbation symptoms, after 1 year "the 48 subjects" in the intervention "were more likely to be abstinent (30% vs 13%; OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.40–5.74)". In population studies from Copenhagen ("19,709" participants), former vs current smokers had fewer hospital admissions "(HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33–0.99)", whereas reduction in smoking alone "was not associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73–1.18)". Effective programs combine counseling and pharmacotherapy, with "cessation rates ranging from 8.8% to 34.5%".

### Strategies to improve smoking cessation rates in primary care [^114cgNSn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care is an important setting in which to treat tobacco addiction. However, the rates at which providers address smoking cessation and the success of that support vary. Strategies can be implemented to improve and increase the delivery of smoking cessation support (e.g. through provider training), and to increase the amount and breadth of support given to people who smoke (e.g. through additional counseling or tailored printed materials).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of strategies intended to increase the success of smoking cessation interventions in primary care settings. To assess whether any effect that these interventions have on smoking cessation may be due to increased implementation by healthcare providers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries to 10 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs (cRCTs) carried out in primary care, including non-pregnant adults. Studies investigated a strategy or strategies to improve the implementation or success of smoking cessation treatment in primary care. These strategies could include interventions designed to increase or enhance the quality of existing support, or smoking cessation interventions offered in addition to standard care (adjunctive interventions). Intervention strategies had to be tested in addition to and in comparison with standard care, or in addition to other active intervention strategies if the effect of an individual strategy could be isolated. Standard care typically incorporates physician-delivered brief behavioral support, and an offer of smoking cessation medication, but differs across studies. Studies had to measure smoking abstinence at six months' follow-up or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome - smoking abstinence - was measured using the most rigorous intention-to-treat definition available. We also extracted outcome data for quit attempts, and the following markers of healthcare provider performance: asking about smoking status; advising on cessation; assessment of participant readiness to quit; assisting with cessation; arranging follow-up for smoking participants. Where more than one study investigated the same strategy or set of strategies, and measured the same outcome, we conducted meta-analyses using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects methods to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 81 RCTs and cRCTs, involving 112,159 participants. Fourteen were rated at low risk of bias, 44 at high risk, and the remainder at unclear risk. We identified moderate-certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency, that the provision of adjunctive counseling by a health professional other than the physician (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 22 studies, 18,150 participants), and provision of cost-free medications (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.76; I² = 63%; 10 studies,7560 participants) increased smoking quit rates in primary care. There was also moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that the addition of tailored print materials to standard smoking cessation treatment increased the number of people who had successfully stopped smoking at six months' follow-up or more (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.59; I² = 37%; 6 studies, 15,978 participants). There was no clear evidence that providing participants who smoked with biomedical risk feedback increased their likelihood of quitting (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.41; I² = 40%; 7 studies, 3491 participants), or that provider smoking cessation training (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; I² = 66%; 7 studies, 13,685 participants) or provider incentives (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.34; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 2454 participants) increased smoking abstinence rates. However, in assessing the former two strategies we judged the evidence to be of low certainty and in assessing the latter strategies it was of very low certainty. We downgraded the evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency and risk of bias across these comparisons. There was some indication that provider training increased the delivery of smoking cessation support, along with the provision of adjunctive counseling and cost-free medications. However, our secondary outcomes were not measured consistently, and in many cases analyses were subject to substantial statistical heterogeneity, imprecision, or both, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Thirty-four studies investigated multicomponent interventions to improve smoking cessation rates. There was substantial variation in the combinations of strategies tested, and the resulting individual study effect estimates, precluding meta-analyses in most cases. Meta-analyses provided some evidence that adjunctive counseling combined with either cost-free medications or provider training enhanced quit rates when compared with standard care alone. However, analyses were limited by small numbers of events, high statistical heterogeneity, and studies at high risk of bias. Analyses looking at the effects of combining provider training with flow sheets to aid physician decision-making, and with outreach facilitation, found no clear evidence that these combinations increased quit rates; however, analyses were limited by imprecision, and there was some indication that these approaches did improve some forms of provider implementation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that providing adjunctive counseling by an allied health professional, cost-free smoking cessation medications, and tailored printed materials as part of smoking cessation support in primary care can increase the number of people who achieve smoking cessation. There is no clear evidence that providing participants with biomedical risk feedback, or primary care providers with training or incentives to provide smoking cessation support enhance quit rates. However, we rated this evidence as of low or very low certainty, and so conclusions are likely to change as further evidence becomes available. Most of the studies in this review evaluated smoking cessation interventions that had already been extensively tested in the general population. Further studies should assess strategies designed to optimize the delivery of those interventions already known to be effective within the primary care setting. Such studies should be cluster-randomized to account for the implications of implementation in this particular setting. Due to substantial variation between studies in this review, identifying optimal characteristics of multicomponent interventions to improve the delivery of smoking cessation treatment was challenging. Future research could use component network meta-analysis to investigate this further.

### Effectiveness of whatsApp online group discussion for smoking relapse prevention: protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^115z1RZY]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

"Offer help to quit tobacco use" is an effective tobacco control measure recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce smoking prevalence [1]. In quitters who received cessation services and achieved short‐term abstinence, approximately half of them would relapse within 6 months [2]. Effective smoking cessation medication can achieve a continuous quit rate from 13–22.5% at 1‐year follow‐up [3], but many quitters still cannot sustain long‐term abstinence. Therefore, most quitters need adequate support and treatment to prevent smoking relapse. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of relapse prevention interventions for tobacco abstainers are still scarce. Our team attempted to explore and assess the effectiveness of a new group‐based intervention for relapse prevention in a previous RCT [4].

Risk factors for smoking relapse in recent quitters can be affective (e.g. anxiety and depressed mood), physiological (e.g. strong nicotine dependence and withdrawal symptoms), cognitive (e.g. low self‐efficacy and knowledge), behavioral (e.g. smoking slips), and social (e.g. lack of social network and social support) [5]. To cope with these barriers, behavioral interventions are typically used to identify coping strategies for high‐risk situations, increase self‐efficacy, improve skills and knowledge, and confront "failure" and "mistakes" perceptions about smoking lapses [5]. These interventions can be delivered via peer sharing, where peers share their experience of quitting smoking and using cessation aids. Peer sharing is much more convincing than expert advice; moreover, it can increase engagement [6] and facilitate mutual support [7]. However, a recent systematic review showed that traditional face‐to‐face group discussion, counseling sessions and follow‐up phone calls may not be effective for relapse prevention [8]. The underlying reasons could be that group sessions can only engage participants for a limited number of counselling sessions, and therefore are unlikely to deliver immediate advice and support when quitters need coping strategies during exposure to smoking cues in a real‐world environment [9, 10]. Moreover, face‐to‐face counselling sessions, which are often led by trained counsellors, cannot attract many smokers and incur high manpower cost [11]. Therefore, the reach and benefits of traditional group‐based smoking cessation treatment is limited due to its ineffectiveness.

### Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115MFNmu]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Interventions and implementation for tobacco cessation — nonpregnant adults describe effective modalities, delivery settings, and intensity. The text states "Effective tobacco smoking cessation interventions for nonpregnant adults include behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy, either individually or in combination". It adds "Combining behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions has been shown to increase tobacco smoking cessation rates compared with either usual care/brief cessation interventions alone or pharmacotherapy alone". Regarding intensity, "Most combination interventions include behavioral counseling involving several sessions (≥ 4), with planned total contact time usually ranging from 90 to 300 minutes", and "The largest effect was found in interventions that provided 6 or more sessions, although the difference in effect among the number of sessions was not significant". Delivery options are that "These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to community settings with feedback to the primary care clinician", and effective formats include "physician advice, nurse advice, individual counseling, group behavioral interventions, telephone counseling, and mobile phone–based interventions".

### Smoking cessation, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113wgScB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the harmful effects of smoking after a cancer diagnosis have been clearly demonstrated, many patients continue to smoke cigarettes during treatment and beyond. The NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation emphasize the importance of smoking cessation in all patients with cancer and seek to establish evidence-based recommendations tailored to the unique needs and concerns of patients with cancer. The recommendations contained herein describe interventions for cessation of all combustible tobacco products (eg, cigarettes, cigars, hookah), including smokeless tobacco products. However, recommendations are based on studies of cigarette smoking. The NCCN Smoking Cessation Panel recommends that treatment plans for all patients with cancer who smoke include the following 3 tenets that should be done concurrently: (1) evidence-based motivational strategies and behavior therapy (counseling), which can be brief; (2) evidence-based pharmacotherapy; and (3) close follow-up with retreatment as needed.

### Motivational interviewing for smoking cessation [^117W9xgo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a directive patient-centred style of counselling, designed to help people to explore and resolve ambivalence about behaviour change. It was developed as a treatment for alcohol abuse, but may help smokers to a make a successful attempt to quit.

Objectives

To determine the effects of motivational interviewing in promoting smoking cessation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies with terms (motivational OR motivation OR motivating OR motivate OR behavi* OR motivat*) and (interview* OR session* OR counsel* OR practi*) in the title or abstract, or as keywords. Date of the most recent search: April 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials in which motivational interviewing or its variants were offered to smokers to assist smoking cessation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow up were treated as continuing smokers. We performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies published between 1997 and 2008, involving over 10,000 smokers. Trials were conducted in one to four sessions, with the duration of each session ranging from 15 to 45 minutes. All but two of the trials used supportive telephone contacts, and supplemented the counselling with self-help materials. MI was generally compared with brief advice or usual care in the trials. Interventions were delivered by primary care physicians, hospital clinicians, nurses or counsellors. Our meta-analysis of MI versus brief advice or usual care yielded a modest but significant increase in quitting (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.42). Subgroup analyses suggested that MI was effective when delivered by primary care physicians (RR 3.49; 95% CI 1.53 to 7.94) and by counsellors (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.43), and when it was conducted in longer sessions (more than 20 minutes per session) (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49). Multiple session treatments may be slightly more effective than single sessions, but both regimens produced positive outcomes. Evidence is unclear at present on the optimal number of follow-up calls. There was variation across the trials in treatment fidelity. All trials used some variant of motivational interviewing. Critical details in how it was modified for the particular study population, the training of therapists and the content of the counselling were sometimes lacking from trial reports.

Authors' Conclusions

Motivational interviewing may assist smokers to quit. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to variations in study quality, treatment fidelity and the possibility of publication or selective reporting bias.

### Helping hospital patients quit: what the evidence supports and what guidelines recommend [^1115GNYB]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The study aimed to critically appraise the extent and strength of systematic review evidence for, and guideline recommendations regarding hospital smoking cessation interventions.

Methods

Systematic reviews of smoking cessation interventions were identified via an electronic search of the Cochrane Library. Meta-analyses from Cochrane reviews were categorised as those that incorporated only studies of hospital based interventions, and those which incorporated interventions which were not hospital based. Smoking cessation guidelines for hospital health professionals were identified via a search of the World Wide Web.

Results

The review found that evidence from meta-analyses restricted to hospital studies was insufficient to evaluate a number of specific intervention strategies and at times conflicted with the findings of meta-analyses without such restrictions. The majority of guidelines recommended the provision of brief advice, counseling, nicotine replacement therapy despite the absence of clear supporting evidence.

Conclusions

Further hospital-based research addressing specific cessation strategies is required. Furthermore, smoking cessation guidelines for hospital based health professionals should more specifically reflect evidence from this setting.

### Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113mJKHY]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF tobacco smoking cessation — pregnant persons evidence and assessment emphasizes behavioral counseling benefits and insufficient evidence for pharmacotherapy and e‑cigarettes. The rationale reports "Convincing evidence that the benefit of behavioral interventions to achieve tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons, and prevent infant low birth weight, is substantial". The USPSTF assessment states "High certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco smoking cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking cessation in pregnant persons is substantial", but there is "Insufficient evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons because of a lack of studies, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined", and "Insufficient evidence on the use of e‑cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Evidence is lacking".

### An appraisal of smoking cessation aids [^115E5qi7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Smoking cessation is the single most efficacious intervention to reduce and prevent smoking-associated morbidity and mortality. This review presents an updated summary of current treatment options. Resources available for management of smoking cessation efforts and variables that may guide treatment of subgroups of patients have also been highlighted.

Recent Findings

The US Department of Health and Human Services released updated guidelines for treatment of smoking cessation in 2008. Recent meta-analyses have reviewed the newly Food and Drug Administration approved drug, varenicline, as well as some new nonpharmacological approaches to treating tobacco dependence.

Summary

Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic aids have proven efficacy in smoking cessation management. The best results are obtained by combining modalities. Tailoring therapy improves success rate.

### A randomized trial of motivational interviewing: cessation induction among smokers with low desire to quit [^113Qtd3k]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite limitations in evidence, the current Clinical Practice Guideline advocates Motivational Interviewing for smokers not ready to quit. This study evaluated the efficacy of Motivational Interviewing for inducing cessation-related behaviors among smokers with low motivation to quit.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Setting/Participants

Two-hundred fifty-five daily smokers reporting low desire to quit smoking were recruited from an urban community during 2010–2011 and randomly assigned to Motivational Interviewing, health education, or brief advice using a 2:2:1 allocation. Data were analyzed from 2012 to 2014.

Intervention

Four sessions of Motivational Interviewing utilized a patient-centered communication style that explored patients' own reasons for change. Four sessions of health education provided education related to smoking cessation while excluding elements characteristic of Motivational Interviewing. A single session of brief advice consisted of brief, personalized advice to quit.

Main Outcomes Measures

Self-reported quit attempts; smoking abstinence (biochemically verified); use of cessation pharmacotherapies; motivation; and confidence to quit were assessed at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups.

Results

Unexpectedly, no significant differences emerged between groups in the proportion who made a quit attempt by 6-month follow-up (Motivational Interviewing, 52.0%; health education, 60.8%; brief advice, 45.1%; p = 0.157). Health education had significantly higher biochemically verified abstinence rates at 6 months (7.8%) than brief advice (0.0%) (8% risk difference, 95% CI = 3%, 13%, p = 0.003), with the Motivational Interviewing group falling in between (2.9% abstinent, 3% risk difference, 95% CI = 0%, 6%, p = 0.079). Both Motivational Interviewing and health education groups showed greater increases in cessation medication use, motivation, and confidence to quit relative to brief advice (all p < 0.05), and health education showed greater increases in motivation relative to Motivational Interviewing (Cohen's d = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.12, 0.60).

Conclusions

Although Motivational Interviewing was generally more efficacious than brief advice in inducing cessation behaviors, health education appeared the most efficacious. These results highlight the need to identify the contexts in which Motivational Interviewing may be most efficacious and question recommendations to use Motivational Interviewing rather than other less complex cessation induction interventions.

Trial Registration

### Telephone counseling and messaging guided by mobile profiling of tobacco users for smoking cessation: a randomized clinical trial [^111uiAfZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is a major modifiable risk factor for premature death, causing about 7.7 million deaths anually. Behavioral and pharmacologic interventions are safe and effective for smoking cessation, but their use remains low. Unassisted quitting is the predominant method for tobacco abstinence, with about two-thirds to three-quarters of individuals who smoke having attempted to quit unassisted worldwide. The World Health Organization recommends leveraging emerging technologies, such as mobile health (mHealth) to increase the accessibility of effective smoking cessation interventions.

Tailored interventions based on individual smoking behaviors such as smoking triggers are common and effective smoking cessation interventions. Personalized telephone counseling increases tobacco abstinence (risk ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19–1.61) compared with self-help materials. Theory-based tailored text messaging could double the biochemical tobacco abstinence rate at 6-month follow-up compared with general messaging. However, lengthy profiling is not accepted for people who smoke who have no intention to seek smoking cessation aids. Mobile apps can facilitate real-time behavioral measurements and user profiling to guide tailored interventions. Nonetheless, about 90% of those apps require active long-term engagement from individuals who smoke, limiting the efficacy in those who do not seek smoking cessation aids. Therefore, there is a need for novel mHealth smoking cessation intervention that enables easy, low-intensity, and accurate smoking profiling to guide smoking cessation intervention.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can prompt participants to report tobacco consumption, nicotine cravings, and smoking triggers by completing very short assessments at multiple time points in a day. Hence, it can be used as a profiling tool for guiding smoking cessation interventions, which is time-saving and highly accessible. In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), we assessed the effectiveness of a novel smoking cessation intervention, which used a self-developed EMA smartphone app to profile smoking behaviors, guiding personalized telephone counseling and instant messaging for tobacco users who had no intention to use smoking cessation aids.

Advice and counseling interventions — a five-step program for intervention provides a helpful strategic framework to guide healthcare providers interested in helping their patients stop smoking; when possible, the patient should be referred to a comprehensive smoking cessation program that incorporates behavioral techniques that enhance patient motivation and confidence, patient education, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; recommendations for treating tobacco use and dependence are summarized in Figure 3.5; because tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, clinicians should recognize that relapse is common and reflects the chronic nature of dependence and addiction, and does not represent failure on the part of the patient or the clinician.

### Interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients [^112p5kRa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020, 32.6% of the world's population used tobacco. Smoking contributes to many illnesses that require hospitalisation. A hospital admission may prompt a quit attempt. Initiating smoking cessation treatment, such as pharmacotherapy and/or counselling, in hospitals may be an effective preventive health strategy. Pharmacotherapies work to reduce withdrawal/craving and counselling provides behavioural skills for quitting smoking. This review updates the evidence on interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients, to understand the most effective smoking cessation treatment methods for hospitalised smokers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any type of smoking cessation programme for patients admitted to an acute care hospital.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 7 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised studies of behavioural, pharmacological or multicomponent interventions to help patients admitted to hospital quit. Interventions had to start in the hospital (including at discharge), and people had to have smoked within the last month. We excluded studies in psychiatric, substance and rehabilitation centres, as well as studies that did not measure abstinence at six months or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was abstinence from smoking assessed at least six months after discharge or the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, preferring biochemically-validated rates where reported. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 82 studies (74 RCTs) that included 42,273 participants in the review (71 studies, 37,237 participants included in the meta-analyses); 36 studies are new to this update. We rated 10 studies as being at low risk of bias overall (low risk in all domains assessed), 48 at high risk of bias overall (high risk in at least one domain), and the remaining 24 at unclear risk. Cessation counselling versus no counselling, grouped by intensity of intervention Hospitalised patients who received smoking cessation counselling that began in the hospital and continued for more than a month after discharge had higher quit rates than patients who received no counselling in the hospital or following hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.49; 28 studies, 8234 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might account for an additional 76 quitters in every 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 103). The evidence was uncertain (very low-certainty) about the effects of counselling interventions of less intensity or shorter duration (in-hospital only counselling ≤ 15 minutes: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.89; 2 studies, 1417 participants; and in-hospital contact plus follow-up counselling support for ≤ 1 month: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20; 7 studies, 4627 participants) versus no counselling. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that smoking cessation counselling for at least 15 minutes in the hospital without post-discharge support led to higher quit rates than no counselling in the hospital (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.58; 12 studies, 4432 participants). Pharmacotherapy versus placebo or no pharmacotherapy Nicotine replacement therapy helped more patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67; 8 studies, 3838 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 62 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 9 to 126). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision (as CI encompassed the possibility of no difference), that varenicline helped more hospitalised patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 4 studies, 829 participants). Evidence for bupropion was low-certainty; the point estimate indicated a modest benefit at best, but CIs were wide and incorporated clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.43, 4 studies, 872 participants). Hospital-only intervention versus intervention that continues after hospital discharge Patients offered both smoking cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge had higher quit rates than patients offered counselling in hospital but not offered post-discharge support (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38; 7 studies, 5610 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 34 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 to 55). Post-discharge interventions offering real-time counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.60, 8 studies, 2299 participants; low certainty-evidence) and those offering unscheduled counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 2 studies, 1598 participants; very low-certainty evidence) may have little to no effect on quit rates compared to control. Telephone quitlines versus control To provide post-discharge support, hospitals may refer patients to community-based telephone quitlines. Both comparisons relating to these interventions had wide CIs encompassing both possible harm and possible benefit, and were judged to be of very low certainty due to imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias (post-discharge telephone counselling versus quitline referral: RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.51; 3 studies, 3260 participants; quitline referral versus control: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.96; 2 studies, 1870 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Offering hospitalised patients smoking cessation counselling beginning in hospital and continuing for over one month after discharge increases quit rates, compared to no hospital intervention. Counselling provided only in hospital, without post-discharge support, may have a modest impact on quit rates, but evidence is less certain. When all patients receive counselling in the hospital, high-certainty evidence indicates that providing both counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge increases quit rates compared to no post-discharge intervention. Starting nicotine replacement or varenicline in hospitalised patients helps more patients to quit smoking than a placebo or no medication, though evidence for varenicline is only moderate-certainty due to imprecision. There is less evidence of benefit for bupropion in this setting. Some of our evidence was limited by imprecision (bupropion versus placebo and varenicline versus placebo), risk of bias, and inconsistency related to heterogeneity. Future research is needed to identify effective strategies to implement, disseminate, and sustain interventions, and to ensure cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy initiated in the hospital is sustained after discharge.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^115mvUVq]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Predicting smoking cessation rates in the comparator and experimental groups: building the model

We ran the pre‐defined models to test the hypotheses for answering the research questions shown in Figure 1 (top row). The decisions after each analysis step are shown in the bottom row of Figure 1. Table SB1 and Supplemental Information SB3 contain all the model output and a detailed explanation of the decisions taken to arrive at the final model. The final model itself is shown in Table 3. We used this final model to estimate the smoking cessation rates in the interpersonal experimental and comparator arms and regressed these on the observed smoking cessation rates (Figure SB4). This model explained approximately half of the variance in smoking cessation rates (pseudo R² = 0.44, r = 0.66).

TABLE 3
Final model used for re‐estimation of smoking cessation rates.

Re‐estimation of cessation rates and comparison of prototypical interventions

The next step was to re‐estimate effect sizes of all trials, as if all interventions had been compared against the same prototypical comparators. Although the final model (Table 3) is based on trials evaluating in‐person delivered interventions so that exposure time can be included, the active content estimates fall well within the 95% CI of the model for written interventions (Tables SB2 and SB3). We, therefore, used the final in‐person delivery model to also re‐estimate the effects for written interventions. Below, we compare trials' reported effect size with seven re‐estimated effect sizes based on the comparator prototypes (Table 2).

Figure 3 shows five panels including bar charts of the reported and re‐estimated effect sizes for all trials, with trials grouped for the five intervention prototypes. The trials are organised from left to right by the size of their reported effect size. The left bar within each trial reflects the reported relative smoking cessation rate in the trial, followed by the seven re‐estimated effect sizes ordered from minimal (no support) to the most intensive (group counselling) prototypical comparator. On the right side of each panel, the aggregated effect size for that group of interventions is shown in boxplots: the reported effect sizes and re‐estimated for the seven prototypical comparators.

### Efficacy of motivational interviewing for smoking cessation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ARwAZ]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

A systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of interventions incorporating motivational interviewing for smoking cessation and identify correlates of treatment effects.

Data Sources

Medline/PubMed, PsycInfo and other sources including grey literature.

Study Selection

Title/abstract search terms were motivational interview* OR motivational enhancement AND smok*, cigarette*, tobacco, OR nicotine. Randomised trials reporting number of smokers abstinent at follow up were eligible.

Data Extraction

Data were independently coded by the first and third authors. We coded for a variety of study, participant, and intervention related variables.

Data Synthesis

A random effects logistic regression with both a random intercept and a random slope for the treatment effect.

Results

31 smoking cessation research trials were selected for the study: eight comprised adolescent samples, eight comprised adults with chronic physical or mental illness, five comprised pregnant/postpartum women and 10 comprised other adult samples. Analysis of the trials (9485 individual participants) showed an overall OR comparing likelihood of abstinence in the motivational interviewing (MI) versus control condition of OR 1.45 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.83). Additional potential correlates of treatment effects such as study, sample, and intervention characteristics were examined.

Conclusions

This is the most comprehensive review of MI for smoking cessation conducted to date. These findings suggest that current MI smoking cessation approaches can be effective for adolescents and adults. However, comparative efficacy trials could be useful.

### Interventions for recruiting smokers into cessation programmes [^115VMwpr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco control is a top public health priority around the globe due to the high prevalence of cigarette smoking and its associated morbidity and mortality. Much effort has been focused on establishing the effectiveness of different smoking cessation strategies. This review, however, aims to address the initial challenge faced by smoking cessation programmes: recruitment of smokers.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of different strategies for recruiting smokers into cessation programmes. The secondary objective was to determine the impact that these strategies had on smoking cessation rates at least six months after enrolment into a cessation programme.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group using a search strategy which included the terms ('recruit$', 'invit$', 'enter', 'entry', 'enrolment') combined with ('smok$', 'cigarette', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco') in the title, abstract or keyword fields. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and registers of current and ongoing trials. We also searched the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised controlled trials that compared at least two different methods of recruiting current smokers into a smoking cessation programme. We also included those studies which focused on the effectiveness of a smoking cessation programme as long as the study involved multiple recruitment methods and reported results of the recruitment phase.

Data Collection and Analysis

From each included study, we extracted data on the type of participants, type of recruitment strategies (i.e., setting, mode of communication used, intensity and duration) and comparisons, and on randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding procedures. Our primary outcome was the proportion of smokers successfully recruited to each cessation programme compared to alternative modalities of recruitment. Our secondary outcome was smoking cessation for at least six months. Given the substantial heterogeneity across recruitment interventions and participants, we adopted a narrative synthesis approach for summarising results.

Main Results

This review includes 19 studies with a total of 14,890 participants. We categorised the included studies according to the modes used to deliver the recruitment strategy: head to head comparison of individual recruitment strategies; comparison of the same delivery mode but with different content or intensity; and the addition of another mode to an existing recruitment method. We identified three studies that made head-to-head comparisons of different types of recruitment strategies. Of these, only one study detected a significant effect, finding that a personal phone call was more effective than a generic invitation letter (RR 40.73, 95% CI 2.53 to 654.74). Five studies compared interventions using the same delivery modes but different content. Results showed that tailored messages through an interactive voice response system resulted in a higher recruitment rate than assessment of smoking status alone using the same system (RR 8.64, 95% CI 4.41 to 16.93), and that text messages indicating scarcity of places available were more effective than generic text message reminders (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.96). One study compared interventions using the same delivery mode but different intensity and found that allowing for more phone call attempts to reach potential participants can result in better recruitment (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.18). Finally, 10 studies investigated the effect of adding a recruitment mode to existing recruitment strategies. Findings showed that: adding a text message reminder or real quotes from participants to a personal phone call improved recruitment of participants (RR 3.38, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.08 and RR 29.07, 95% CI 1.74 to 485.70, respectively); that adding a personal phone call to an existing newsletter can also increase recruitment rates (RR 65.12, 95% CI 4.06 to 1045.4]); that a reactive-proactive recruitment phase is more effective than a proactive phase alone (63.8% versus 47.5%, RR not available); and that active recruitment at schools is more effective than passive recruitment (p < 0.001, denominator not available for calculation of RR). Additionally, a number of studies in this category showed that providing incentives can effectively increase the number of participants recruited into smoking cessation programmes. Out of the 19 included studies, only four reported on the effect of recruitment strategy on smoking cessation at six months or longer. Three of these studies compared strategies that used the same delivery mode with different content. Their results were non-significant. The remaining three studies evaluated adding an additional mode to an existing recruitment intervention. Only one of them showed a significant difference in the levels of smoking cessation that favoured the enhanced recruitment strategy, but this may have reflected the offer of incentives once in the programme rather than the recruitment strategy itself (RR at 15 or 18 months 2.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.56).

Authors' Conclusions

The substantial heterogeneity across the included studies restricts our ability to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies in relation to recruitment of participants into smoking cessation programmes or levels of smoking cessation. The limited evidence, however, suggests that the following elements may improve the recruitment of smokers into cessation programmes: personal, tailored interventions; recruitment methods that are proactive in nature; and more intensive recruitment strategies (i.e., those strategies that require increased contact with potential participants).

### Individual behavioural counselling for smoking cessation [^1141HzSY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Individual counselling from a smoking cessation specialist may help smokers to make a successful attempt to stop smoking.

Objectives

The objective of the review is to determine the effects of individual counselling.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies with counsel* in any field. Date of the most recent search: December 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized trials with at least one treatment arm consisting of face-to-face individual counselling from a healthcare worker not involved in routine clinical care. The outcome was smoking cessation at follow up at least six months after the start of counselling.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors extracted data. The intervention and population, method of randomization and completeness of follow up were recorded.

Main Results

We identified 21 trials with over 7000 participants. Eighteen trials compared individual counselling to a minimal behavioural intervention, four compared different types or intensities of counselling. Individual counselling was more effective than control. The odds ratio for successful smoking cessation was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.84). In a subgroup of three trials where all participants received nicotine replacement therapy the point estimate of effect was smaller and did not reach significance (odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.83). We failed to detect a greater effect of intensive counselling compared to brief counselling (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.56).

Authors' Conclusions

Smoking cessation counselling can assist smokers to quit.

PICO 1 — smoking cessation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): In patients with COPD, we suggest including smoking cessation counseling and treatment using best practices as a component of a comprehensive clinical strategy to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2C). This recommendation places high value on the benefits of smoking cessation for all individuals, and in particular, it is the only evidence-based intervention that improves COPD prognosis by mitigating lung function decline and reduces symptoms.

### Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1139HV7S]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF tobacco smoking cessation — nonpregnant adults evidence and assessment indicates substantial benefit from behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy. The rationale notes "Convincing evidence that the benefit of behavioral interventions (including physician and nurse advice, individual and group counseling, and telephone and mobile phone–based interventions), alone or combined with pharmacotherapy, to increase achievement of tobacco smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial". It also states "Convincing evidence that the benefit of pharmacotherapy interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion (hydrochloride sustained-release [bupropion SR]), and varenicline — with or without behavioral counseling interventions — to achieve tobacco smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial", and "Convincing evidence that using 2 types of NRT (fast-acting plus patch) moderately increases tobacco smoking cessation rates over using 1 type, and that the addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone". Evidence is "Inadequate… to determine the effect of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on achievement of tobacco smoking cessation". The USPSTF assessment concludes "High certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial", with "Insufficient evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults; the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined".

### Pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation [^115ro1Eo]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Among the 3 first-line smoking cessation treatments (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, and varenicline), which is most effective in helping people who smoke achieve and maintain abstinence from smoking for at least 6 months, and what serious adverse events are associated with each?

Bottom Line

Higher rates of smoking cessation were associated with NRT (17.6%) and bupropion (19.1%) compared with placebo (10.6%). Varenicline (27.6%) and combination NRT (31.5%) (eg, patch plus inhaler) were most effective for achieving smoking cessation. None of the therapies was associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events.

Perioperative patient counseling — Smoking cessation before surgery should be routinely recommended to every smoker seen for a preoperative evaluation, regardless of how soon surgery is planned, with benefit increasing with the duration of preoperative abstinence and even brief cessation having benefit; the perioperative risks of smoking are well established and include infection, MI, neurological complications, increased requirement for pain medications, prolonged length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and death; smokers undergoing elective surgery have increased odds of thromboembolism, respiratory and wound complications, unplanned hospital readmissions, and mortality, with excess risk lasting at least 1 year after surgery; patients continuing to smoke following percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery face poorer long-term outcomes, losing 2 to 3 years of life expectancy compared with those who stop smoking.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^1179xkZV]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and aims

Behavioural smoking cessation trials have used comparators that vary considerably between trials. Although some previous meta‐analyses made attempts to account for variability in comparators, these relied on subsets of trials and incomplete data on comparators. This study aimed to estimate the relative effectiveness of (individual) smoking cessation interventions while accounting for variability in comparators using comprehensive data on experimental and comparator interventions.

Methods

A systematic review and meta‐regression was conducted including 172 randomised controlled trials with at least 6 months follow‐up and biochemically verified smoking cessation. Authors were contacted to obtain unpublished information. This information was coded in terms of active content and attributes of the study population and methods. Meta‐regression was used to create a model predicting smoking cessation outcomes. This model was used to re‐estimate intervention effects, as if all interventions have been evaluated against the same comparators. Outcome measures included log odds of smoking cessation for the meta‐regression models and smoking cessation differences and ratios to compare relative effectiveness.

Results

The meta‐regression model predicted smoking cessation rates well (pseudo R² = 0.44). Standardising the comparator had substantial impact on conclusions regarding the (relative) effectiveness of trials and types of intervention. Compared with a 'no support comparator', self‐help was 1.33 times (95% CI = 1.16–1.49), brief physician advice 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.31–1.90), nurse individual counselling 1.76 times (95% CI = 1.62–1.90), psychologist individual counselling 2.04 times (95% CI = 1.95–2.15) and group psychologist interventions 2.06 times (95% CI = 1.92–2.20) more effective. Notably, more elaborate experimental interventions (e.g. psychologist counselling) were typically compared with more elaborate comparators, masking their effectiveness.

Conclusions

Comparator variability and underreporting of comparators obscures the interpretation, comparison and generalisability of behavioural smoking cessation trials. Comparator variability should, therefore, be taken into account when interpreting and synthesising evidence from trials. Otherwise, policymakers, practitioners and researchers may draw incorrect conclusions about the (cost) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions and their constituent components.

### Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111esZGM]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF tobacco cessation — scope and intervention types in adults: The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of primary care interventions on tobacco use cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. For behavioral counseling in nonpregnant adults, evidence came from approximately 830 RCTs and more than 500 000 participants, and the evidence almost exclusively evaluated interventions for cessation of cigarette smoking. Physician advice, nurse advice, individual counseling with a cessation specialist, group behavioral interventions, telephone counseling, and mobile phone–based interventions have all been found to be effective to increase cessation of cigarette smoking.

### Behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1142Zq5P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on counseling and interventions to prevent tobacco use and tobacco-related disease in adults, including pregnant women.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions for tobacco smoking cessation that are relevant to primary care (behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and complementary or alternative therapy) in adults, including pregnant women.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to adults who use tobacco. (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant women who use tobacco. (A recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women. (I statement). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic nicotine delivery systems for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant women. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effectiveness and safety (previously stated). (I statement).

### Smoking cessation interventions in clinical practice [^113umG2g]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Physicians are in a unique position to advise smokers to quit by integrating the various aspects of nicotine dependence. This review provides an overview of interventions for smokers presenting in a clinical setting.

Results

Strategies used for smoking cessation counselling differ according to patient's readiness to quit. For smokers who do not intend to quit smoking, physicians should inform and sensitise them about tobacco use and cessation. For smokers who are dissonant, physicians should use motivational strategies, such as discussing barriers to cessation and their solutions. For smokers ready to quit, the physician should show strong support, help set a quit date, prescribe pharmaceutical therapies for nicotine dependence, such as nicotine replacement therapy (i.e., gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, mouth inhaler, lozenges, micro and sublingual tablets) and/or bupropion (atypical antidepressant thought to work by blocking neural reuptake of dopamine and/or nor epinephrine), with instructions for use, and suggest behavioural strategies to prevent relapse. The efficacy of all of these pharmacotherapies is comparable, roughly doubling cessation rates over control conditions. Varenicline is a promising new effective drug recently approved by many health authorities.

Conclusion

Physician counselling and pharmacotherapeutic interventions for smoking cessation are among the most cost-effective clinical interventions.

### Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation [^116fHuvM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco use is estimated to kill 7 million people a year. Nicotine is highly addictive, but surveys indicate that almost 70% of US and UK smokers would like to stop smoking. Although many smokers attempt to give up on their own, advice from a health professional increases the chances of quitting. As of 2016 there were 3.5 billion Internet users worldwide, making the Internet a potential platform to help people quit smoking.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation, whether intervention effectiveness is altered by tailoring or interactive features, and if there is a difference in effectiveness between adolescents, young adults, and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, which included searches of MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO (through OVID). There were no restrictions placed on language, publication status or publication date. The most recent search was conducted in August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Participants were people who smoked, with no exclusions based on age, gender, ethnicity, language or health status. Any type of Internet intervention was eligible. The comparison condition could be a no-intervention control, a different Internet intervention, or a non-Internet intervention. To be included, studies must have measured smoking cessation at four weeks or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and extracted data. We extracted and, where appropriate, pooled smoking cessation outcomes of six-month follow-up or more, reporting short-term outcomes narratively where longer-term outcomes were not available. We reported study effects as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We grouped studies according to whether they (1) compared an Internet intervention with a non-active control arm (e.g. printed self-help guides), (2) compared an Internet intervention with an active control arm (e.g. face-to-face counselling), (3) evaluated the addition of behavioural support to an Internet programme, or (4) compared one Internet intervention with another. Where appropriate we grouped studies by age.

Main Results

We identified 67 RCTs, including data from over 110,000 participants. We pooled data from 35,969 participants. There were only four RCTs conducted in adolescence or young adults that were eligible for meta-analysis. Results for trials in adults: Eight trials compared a tailored and interactive Internet intervention to a non-active control. Pooled results demonstrated an effect in favour of the intervention (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30, n = 6786). However, statistical heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 58%) and was unexplained, and the overall quality of evidence was low according to GRADE. Five trials compared an Internet intervention to an active control. The pooled effect estimate favoured the control group, but crossed the null (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.09, n = 3806, I² = 0%); GRADE quality rating was moderate. Five studies evaluated an Internet programme plus behavioural support compared to a non-active control (n = 2334). Pooled, these studies indicated a positive effect of the intervention (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.18). Although statistical heterogeneity was substantial (I 2 = 60%) and was unexplained, the GRADE rating was moderate. Four studies evaluated the Internet plus behavioural support compared to active control. None of the studies detected a difference between trial arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18, n = 2769, I² = 0%); GRADE rating was moderate. Seven studies compared an interactive or tailored Internet intervention, or both, to an Internet intervention that was not tailored/interactive. Pooled results favoured the interactive or tailored programme, but the estimate crossed the null (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22, n = 14,623, I² = 0%); GRADE rating was moderate. Three studies compared tailored with non-tailored Internet-based messages, compared to non-tailored messages. The tailored messages produced higher cessation rates compared to control, but the estimate was not precise (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.41, n = 4040), and there was evidence of unexplained substantial statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 57%); GRADE rating was low. Results should be interpreted with caution as we judged some of the included studies to be at high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from trials in adults suggests that interactive and tailored Internet-based interventions with or without additional behavioural support are moderately more effective than non-active controls at six months or longer, but there was no evidence that these interventions were better than other active smoking treatments. However some of the studies were at high risk of bias, and there was evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity. Treatment effectiveness in younger people is unknown.

### The effectiveness of callback counselling for smoking cessation: a randomized trial [^114fbFQK]. Addiction (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

The development of acceptable, widely available and effective smoking cessation methods is central to public health strategy for tobacco control. We examined the effectiveness of a telephone callback counselling intervention, compared to the provision of self-help resources alone.

Methods

Participants were 998 smokers calling a state-wide "Quitline" service randomly allocated to either callback counselling or ordinary care. The callback condition consisted of a series of brief counselling calls at strategic times in addition to ordinary care. The number of calls varied according to caller needs, and most occurred generally just before the person's quit day and in the week or two after it. The service was delivered by trained telephone counsellors.

Results

At the 3-month follow-up, significantly more participants in the callback group (24%) reported that they were quit, compared to those in the usual care comparison group (13%). The difference in point prevalence of smoking declined to 6% by the 12-month follow-up. Using sustained abstinence there was a significant benefit of callback counselling at 12-month follow-up. Treating dropouts as smokers reduced the overall magnitude of the effects somewhat. The benefit of callbacks was to marginally increase quit attempts and to significantly reduce relapse.

Conclusion

Our findings are consistent with those of other studies demonstrating benefits of callback telephone counselling to facilitate cessation. Such counselling provides a flexible, relatively inexpensive and widely available form of cessation service. It appears to encourage a greater proportion of quit attempts and to reduce the rate of relapse among those quitting. Further research is required to determine ways to enhance effectiveness, particularly studies of how to reduce relapse.

### Do smokers know how to quit? Knowledge and perceived effectiveness of cessation assistance as predictors of cessation behaviour [^113Af9j4]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite the existence of effective cessation methods, the vast majority of smokers attempt to quit on their own. To date, there is little evidence to explain the low adoption rates for effective forms of cessation assistance, including pharmaceutical aids. This study sought to assess smokers' awareness and perceived effectiveness of cessation methods and to examine the relationship of this knowledge to cessation behaviour.

Design

A random-digit-dial telephone survey (response rate = 76%) with 3-month follow-up was conducted with 616 adult daily smokers in South-Western Ontario, Canada.

Measurements

A baseline survey assessed smoking behaviour, as well as smokers' awareness and perceived effectiveness of cessation assistance. A follow-up survey measured changes in smoking behaviour and adoption of cessation assistance at 3 months.

Findings

Participants demonstrated a poor recall of cessation methods: 45% of participants did not recall nicotine gum, 33% did not recall the nicotine patch and 57% did not recall bupropion. Also, many participants did not believe that the following cessation methods would increase their likelihood of quitting: nicotine replacement therapies (36%), bupropion (35%), counselling from a health professional (66%) and group counselling/quit programmes (50%). In addition, 78% of smokers indicated that they were just as likely to quit on their own as they were with assistance. Most important, participants who perceived cessation methods to be effective at baseline, were more likely to intend to quit (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.12–2.90), make a quit attempt at follow-up (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.03–3.16) and to adopt cessation assistance when doing so (OR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.04–12.58).

Conclusions

This research suggests that many smokers may be unaware of effective cessation methods and most underestimate their benefit. Further, this lack of knowledge may represent a significant barrier to treatment adoption.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^116FKKmN]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Face‐to‐face behavioural support

Behavioural support involves advice, discussion and encouragement, and other activities designed to (1) maximize motivation to remain abstinent, (2) minimize motivation to smoke, (3) enhance the skills and capacity needed to avoid and resist urges to smoke and (4) optimize effective use of stop‐smoking medication where available 36, 37. It can be delivered individually or in groups. The studies conducted to date have usually involved multiple sessions provided by specially trained health professionals over a period from 1 to more than 4 weeks following a target quit date.

Efficacy

When given to smokers who set a quit date and who are willing to receive such help, individual face‐to‐face behavioural support has been found in multiple RCTs to increase 6–12‐month continuous abstinence rates by 4 percentage points (95% CI = 2–5) compared with provision of written materials or brief advice 38. Group support has been found to increase 6–12‐month continuous abstinence rates by 5 percentage points (95% CI = 4–7) compared with printed self‐help materials 39. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to draw conclusions about whether group‐based support is more effective than individual support 39. Behavioural support has been found to add to the efficacy of medication 40. Behavioural support has also been found to be effective in helping smokeless tobacco users to quit 3.

### Group behaviour therapy programmes for smoking cessation [^111qFJoV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Group therapy offers individuals the opportunity to learn behavioural techniques for smoking cessation, and to provide each other with mutual support.

Objectives

To determine the effect of group-delivered behavioural interventions in achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, using the terms 'behavior therapy', 'cognitive therapy', 'psychotherapy' or 'group therapy', in May 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials that compared group therapy with self-help, individual counselling, another intervention or no intervention (including usual care or a waiting-list control). We also considered trials that compared more than one group programme. We included those trials with a minimum of two group meetings, and follow-up of smoking status at least six months after the start of the programme. We excluded trials in which group therapy was provided to both active therapy and placebo arms of trials of pharmacotherapies, unless they had a factorial design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the interventions provided to the groups and the controls, including programme length, intensity and main components, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in participants smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically-validated rates where available. We analysed participants lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. We expressed effects as a risk ratio for cessation. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model. We assessed the quality of evidence within each study and comparison, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Sixty-six trials met our inclusion criteria for one or more of the comparisons in the review. Thirteen trials compared a group programme with a self-help programme; there was an increase in cessation with the use of a group programme (N = 4395, risk ratio (RR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.33, I² = 0%). We judged the GRADE quality of evidence to be moderate, downgraded due to there being few studies at low risk of bias. Fourteen trials compared a group programme with brief support from a health care provider. There was a small increase in cessation (N = 7286, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.43, I² = 59%). We judged the GRADE quality of evidence to be low, downgraded due to inconsistency in addition to risk of bias. There was also low quality evidence of benefit of a group programme compared to no-intervention controls, (9 trials, N = 1098, RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.76 I² = 55%). We did not detect evidence that group therapy was more effective than a similar intensity of individual counselling (6 trials, N = 980, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28, I² = 9%). Programmes which included components for increasing cognitive and behavioural skills were not shown to be more effective than same-length or shorter programmes without these components.

Authors' Conclusions

Group therapy is better for helping people stop smoking than self-help, and other less intensive interventions. There is not enough evidence to evaluate whether groups are more effective, or cost-effective, than intensive individual counselling. There is not enough evidence to support the use of particular psychological components in a programme beyond the support and skills training normally included.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^111kv68S]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

An important issue with regard to any tobacco cessation intervention is the question about how far it aims to promote attempts to quit versus helping quit attempts to succeed. This leads to what may be termed 'the first law of tobacco cessation', stated as:where E is the number of ex‐tobacco users generated in a given period, N is the number of tobacco users attempting to stop and S is the probability of success of those quit attempts. Note that one may adopt different time‐periods for someone counting as an ex‐user, but for present purposes only permanent ex‐users are considered, except for smoking cessation in pregnancy.

While this equation represents an obvious truth, it serves to focus attention on the need to tailor intervention strategies to different contexts. For example, in populations where the rate of cessation attempts is low but success rates are high, it is more efficient to focus resources on interventions to boost N. In populations where N is already high and S is low, it may be more efficient to seek to boost S. Of course, N and S may affect each other. For example, availability of more effective methods of stopping may boost the rate of attempts to stop. It is necessary to consider these issues when considering the different interventions.

Related to this is the importance of considering the reach of an intervention. A 1 percentage‐point increase in cessation from intervention A that is delivered to 30% of smokers will have a greater population impact than a 5 percentage‐point increase from intervention B that is accessed by only 2% of smokers. Thus, some of the interventions being reviewed with low effectiveness may have a greater impact than others with high effectiveness.

This review covers all forms of tobacco use and is intended to be applicable globally. However, as noted earlier, almost all the evidence is from studies of smoking, and from high‐income countries. Where we have been able to find studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries we have included them. In the absence of evidence to the contrary we propose that evidence on smoking cessation should be applied to all forms of tobacco cessation, and in the absence of evidence from low‐ and middle‐income countries we propose that the evidence from high‐income countries be applied to all countries, interpreted in the light of national circumstances and priorities.

### Motivational interviewing for smoking cessation [^115dxRQf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a directive patient-centred style of counselling, designed to help people to explore and resolve ambivalence about behaviour change. It was developed as a treatment for alcohol abuse, but may help people to a make a successful attempt to stop smoking.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of MI for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, in addition to another form of smoking cessation treatment, and compared with other types of smoking cessation treatment. We also investigated whether more intensive MI is more effective than less intensive MI for smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for studies using the term motivat* NEAR2 (interview* OR enhanc* OR session* OR counsel* OR practi* OR behav*) in the title or abstract, or motivation* as a keyword. We also searched trial registries to identify unpublished studies. Date of the most recent search: August 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which MI or its variants were offered to smokers to assist smoking cessation. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional non-MI intervention components not matched between arms. We excluded trials in pregnant women as these are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking cessation was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for smoking cessation for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models. We extracted data on mental health outcomes and quality of life and summarised these narratively.

Main Results

We identified 37 eligible studies involving over 15,000 participants who smoked tobacco. The majority of studies recruited participants with particular characteristics, often from groups of people who are less likely to seek support to stop smoking than the general population. Although a few studies recruited participants who intended to stop smoking soon or had no intentions to quit, most recruited a population without regard to their intention to quit. MI was conducted in one to 12 sessions, with the total duration of MI ranging from five to 315 minutes across studies. We judged four of the 37 studies to be at low risk of bias, and 11 to be at high risk, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk did not significantly alter results, apart from in one case - our analysis comparing higher to lower intensity MI. We found low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, comparing the effect of MI to no treatment for smoking cessation (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; I² = 0%; adjusted N = 684). One study was excluded from this analysis as the participants recruited (incarcerated men) were not comparable to the other participants included in the analysis, resulting in substantial statistical heterogeneity when all studies were pooled (I² = 87%). Enhancing existing smoking cessation support with additional MI, compared with existing support alone, gave an RR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.36; adjusted N = 4167; I² = 47%), and MI compared with other forms of smoking cessation support gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.69; I² = 54%; N = 5192). We judged both of these estimates to be of low certainty due to heterogeneity and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence detected a benefit of higher intensity MI when compared with lower intensity MI (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; adjusted N = 5620; I² = 0%). The evidence was limited because three of the five studies in this comparison were at risk of bias. Excluding them gave an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I² = n/a; N = 482), changing the interpretation of the results. Mental health and quality of life outcomes were reported in only one study, providing little evidence on whether MI improves mental well-being.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not MI helps people to stop smoking compared with no intervention, as an addition to other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation, or compared with other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation. It is also unclear whether more intensive MI is more effective than less intensive MI. All estimates of treatment effect were of low certainty because of concerns about bias in the trials, imprecision and inconsistency. Consequently, future trials are likely to change these conclusions. There is almost no evidence on whether MI for smoking cessation improves mental well-being.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^113QcN5u]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for smoking cessation

The current study focused on behavioural smoking cessation trials, selected studies using objective outcomes for smoking cessation, collected all published data and a large amount of unpublished data from trial authors, used pre‐registered and hypothesis‐driven analyses plans for the main variables as well as the control variables and accounted for comparator variability when comparing trials and intervention categories. For smoking cessation researchers, practitioners and policymakers, it offers several contributions to the current literature. First, the re‐estimated trial effect sizes in Figure 3 can help identify the most promising smoking cessation interventions to adopt into policy or practice, in terms of their estimated effectiveness under different comparator (including 'usual care') conditions. Figure 3 also shows that interventions that on first sight appear highly effective in helping people stop smoking (usually the one or two trials on the left‐hand side in Figure 4 panels) appear as outliers based on their reported smoking cessation rates and are rarely among the more effective interventions under standardised comparator conditions (and standardised covariates). It, therefore, seems important that these potentially very promising interventions are replicated in another trial before being considered for adoption in guidelines and implemented in practice. Third, Figure 3 also shows that when more resource‐intensive smoking cessation interventions (i.e. nurse and in particular psychologists individual and group counselling comparators) are replaced with 'light' interventions (such as brief advice or self‐help), we can expect to see a substantial decrease in the effectiveness of the smoking cessation services provided.

Figure 4 shows that when you aggregate and compare interventions based on their reported effectiveness, there is actually not a good argument for investing in more resource‐intensive smoking cessation interventions. All types of interventions appear equally effective. However, this turns out to be because more resource‐intensive and effective interventions are compared with more resource‐intensive and effective comparators. When comparators are standardised, however, it becomes evident that psychologist and group counselling interventions are on average three times as effective as self‐help interventions, almost twice as effective as brief physician advice and 1.5 times as effective as the medium‐intensive non‐specialist nurse/pharmacist counselling interventions. Hence, policymakers and practitioners are advised to — when they decide on which smoking cessation services to offer — account for differences in comparators between intervention categories (e.g. by using the results of the current meta‐analysis or network meta‐analyses that successfully account for comparator variability).

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113oAH7j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco cessation — nonpharmacological behavioral interventions include behavioral skills training using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, motivational interviewing, and incentives to motivate and reinforce behavior change; a recent randomized trial reported that adding financial incentives to free cessation aids or free e‑cigarettes resulted in a significantly higher rate of sustained (6 month) smoking abstinence than these aids alone, whereas receiving only information and motivational text messages had a significantly lower sustained smoking abstinence rate. A clinician's advice to stop smoking can be made more effective by connecting smokers with other resources, which may include a tobacco treatment specialist or referral to community-based resources; automated systems that link smokers to specialized treatment services can improve outcomes. Behavioral treatments work best when combined with pharmacological smoking cessation treatments and delivered by trained tobacco treatment specialists over multiple face‑to‑face and/or phone sessions, and even just advice to quit from a doctor has a positive effect on increasing quit rates; however, the most effective delivery formats are widely underutilized, and financial incentives have not been widely implemented in practice.

### Stakeholder research priorities for smoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening programs. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1137sdfC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder prioritization — intervention to study (n = 36) ranks intervention-focused research questions for smoking cessation in lung cancer screening settings with mean score and percentage who ranked 1 or 2. Final rank 1 evaluates effectiveness of established evidence-based interventions including counseling, nicotine replacement, and other pharmacotherapy (2.86; 52.8%). Final rank 2 addresses the most effective counseling strategies and messaging (3.25; 41.7%). Final rank 3 examines the most effective platform to promote use of evidence-based cessation (examples include patient navigators, health maintenance alerts, and texting) (3.89; 33.3%). Final rank 4 compares novel/innovative interventions with established interventions (examples include mobile health applications, e-cigarettes, and financial incentives) (4.11; 27.8%). Final rank 7 asks about optimal intensity and comparative effectiveness of interventions that vary in intensity (5.03; 13.9%).

### Smoking cessation in patients with respiratory disease: existing treatments and future directions [^114SJRbr]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, account for a large proportion of tobacco-related deaths. Smoking cessation benefits almost all smokers, irrespective of the age at which they quit, making smoking cessation a core component of prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases. Evidence shows that psychosocial counselling and pharmacotherapy are effective smoking cessation methods and are most effective when used together. The first-line drugs licensed to aid smoking cessation (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) are effective in patients with COPD. Efforts are underway to improve the efficacy of existing treatments and increase the proportion of smokers who try to quit, and who use treatment when doing so. However, existing smoking cessation counselling and drugs are among the most cost-effective clinical preventive services available. Incorporation of such treatment into routine clinical practice is essential for provision of high-quality care to all patients, especially those with respiratory disease.

### Additional behavioural support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation [^116fgwHj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation increase the likelihood of achieving abstinence in a quit attempt. It is plausible that providing support, or, if support is offered, offering more intensive support or support including particular components may increase abstinence further.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of adding or increasing the intensity of behavioural support for people using smoking cessation medications, and to assess whether there are different effects depending on the type of pharmacotherapy, or the amount of support in each condition. We also looked at studies which directly compare behavioural interventions matched for contact time, where pharmacotherapy is provided to both groups (e.g. tests of different components or approaches to behavioural support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP in June 2018 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline, that evaluated the addition of personal support or compared two or more intensities of behavioural support.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which all participants received pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and conditions differed by the amount or type of behavioural support. The intervention condition had to involve person-to-person contact (defined as face-to-face or telephone). The control condition could receive less intensive personal contact, a different type of personal contact, written information, or no behavioural support at all. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women and trials which did not set out to assess smoking cessation at six months or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically-validated rates, if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Eighty-three studies, 36 of which were new to this update, met the inclusion criteria, representing 29,536 participants. Overall, we judged 16 studies to be at low risk of bias and 21 studies to be at high risk of bias. All other studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias. Results were not sensitive to the exclusion of studies at high risk of bias. We pooled all studies comparing more versus less support in the main analysis. Findings demonstrated a benefit of behavioural support in addition to pharmacotherapy. When all studies of additional behavioural therapy were pooled, there was evidence of a statistically significant benefit from additional support (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22, I² = 8%, 65 studies, n = 23,331) for abstinence at longest follow-up, and this effect was not different when we compared subgroups by type of pharmacotherapy or intensity of contact. This effect was similar in the subgroup of eight studies in which the control group received no behavioural support (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43, I² = 20%, n = 4,018). Seventeen studies compared interventions matched for contact time but that differed in terms of the behavioural components or approaches employed. Of the 15 comparisons, all had small numbers of participants and events. Only one detected a statistically significant effect, favouring a health education approach (which the authors described as standard counselling containing information and advice) over motivational interviewing approach (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94, n = 378).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that providing behavioural support in person or via telephone for people using pharmacotherapy to stop smoking increases quit rates. Increasing the amount of behavioural support is likely to increase the chance of success by about 10% to 20%, based on a pooled estimate from 65 trials. Subgroup analysis suggests that the incremental benefit from more support is similar over a range of levels of baseline support. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of specific components that comprise behavioural support.

### Treatment of tobacco smoking: a review [^1166C5iM]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.

Observations

Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^113QaSpR]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Smoking cessation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — International organizations recommend tobacco cessation for all adults with COPD, citing it as the most effective intervention in reducing COPD progression and morbidity; smoking cessation is the only evidence-based intervention that improves COPD prognosis by ameliorating the annual decline in lung function, reducing cough and sputum production, improving health-related quality of life, and reducing COPD exacerbations. Programs may include advice to quit, pharmacologic therapies or counseling, and reported smoking cessation rates ranging from 8.8% to 34.5% vary by strategy; exacerbation frequency and active smoking may independently result in lung function decline. We identified two observational evaluations of tobacco cessation effects on COPD exacerbations and two RCTs.

### Relapse prevention interventions for smoking cessation [^116gCqdn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A number of treatments can help smokers make a successful quit attempt, but many initially successful quitters relapse over time. Several interventions have been proposed to help prevent relapse.

Objectives

To assess whether specific interventions for relapse prevention reduce the proportion of recent quitters who return to smoking.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in May 2013 for studies mentioning relapse prevention or maintenance in title, abstracts or keywords.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of relapse prevention interventions with a minimum follow-up of six months. We included smokers who quit on their own, were undergoing enforced abstinence, or were participating in treatment programmes. We included trials that compared relapse prevention interventions with a no intervention control, or that compared a cessation programme with additional relapse prevention components with a cessation programme alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were screened and data extracted by one review author, and checked by a second. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by referral to a third review author.

Main Results

Sixty-three studies met inclusion criteria but were heterogeneous in terms of populations and interventions. We considered 41 studies that randomly assigned abstainers separately from studies that randomly assigned participants before their quit date. Upon looking at studies of behavioural interventions that randomly assigned abstainers, we detected no benefit of brief and 'skills-based' relapse prevention methods for women who had quit smoking because of pregnancy, or for smokers undergoing a period of enforced abstinence during hospitalisation or military training. We also failed to detect significant effects of behavioural interventions in trials in unselected groups of smokers who had quit on their own or through a formal programme. Amongst trials randomly assigning smokers before their quit date and evaluating the effects of additional relapse prevention components, we found no evidence of benefit of behavioural interventions or combined behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions in any subgroup. Overall, providing training in skills thought to be needed for relapse avoidance did not reduce relapse, but most studies did not use experimental designs best suited to the task and had limited power to detect expected small differences between interventions. For pharmacological interventions, extended treatment with varenicline significantly reduced relapse in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.36). Pooling of six studies of extended treatment with bupropion failed to detect a significant effect (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.35). Two small trials of oral nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) failed to detect an effect, but treatment compliance was low, and in two other trials of oral NRT in which short-term abstainers were randomly assigned, a significant effect of intervention was noted.

Authors' Conclusions

At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific behavioural intervention to help smokers who have successfully quit for a short time to avoid relapse. The verdict is strongest for interventions focused on identifying and resolving tempting situations, as most studies were concerned with these. Little research is available regarding other behavioural approaches. Extended treatment with varenicline may prevent relapse. Extended treatment with bupropion is unlikely to have a clinically important effect. Studies of extended treatment with nicotine replacement are needed.

### The efficacy of smoking cessation strategies in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from a systematic review [^114zxNA9]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Smoking cessation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It prevents or delays the development of airflow limitation and also reduces its progression. The objective of this study was to systematically review the effects of interventions for smoking cessation in people with COPD. Comprehensive searches of electronic and internet databases were carried out from 1966 to March 2002, using the Cochrane Airways Group search strategy. The reference lists of all selected randomized trials and relevant reviews were inspected for additional published reports and citations of unpublished research. We evaluated the efficacy of behavioural interventions (e.g. counselling), pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine therapy such as bupropion), and combinations of both. The main clinical outcome measure was prolonged abstinence after at least 6 months, confirmed by a biochemical test. Five trials comprising 6491 patients with COPD were included. Results of the Lung Health Study show that, by using an intensive behavioural (relapse prevention) programme combined with nicotine replacement therapy, prolonged abstinence rates are not only significantly higher compared with no intervention, but the difference in efficacy was sustained for over 5 years. A 12-week treatment course with bupropion sustained release combined with individual counselling, however, did not result in significantly higher prolonged abstinence rates after 12 months. Present evidence suggests that the most effective intervention for prolonged smoking cessation in patients with COPD is the combination of nicotine replacement therapy, coupled with an intensive, prolonged relapse prevention programme.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^116o2wpn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 — Pathway for Tobacco Cessation Treatment — cardiovascular clinicians or other professionals ask tobacco use status with categories including current smoker (daily or nondaily cigarette smoking) and former smoker, then proceed through assessment and treatment steps. In current smokers, clinicians assess nicotine dependence including number of cigarettes per day and time to first cigarette after waking, give advice to quit now, and offer treatment options that include behavioral support and to prescribe pharmacotherapy if not contraindicated. For those starting treatment, a phone call or office visit at 2–4 weeks is used to monitor treatment response, adherence and adverse effects, while those declining receive continuous engagement to quit at every visit. For former smokers, the pathway includes assessment for risk of relapse with relapse prevention advice and continued monitoring of tobacco abstinence and SHS exposure.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^115d3YPt]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Behavioural smoking cessation trials have used comparators that vary considerably between trials. Although some previous meta-analyses made attempts to account for variability in comparators, these relied on subsets of trials and incomplete data on comparators. This study aimed to estimate the relative effectiveness of (individual) smoking cessation interventions while accounting for variability in comparators using comprehensive data on experimental and comparator interventions.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted including 172 randomised controlled trials with at least 6months follow-up and biochemically verified smoking cessation. Authors were contacted to obtain unpublished information. This information was coded in terms of active content and attributes of the study population and methods. Meta-regression was used to create a model predicting smoking cessation outcomes. This model was used to re-estimate intervention effects, as if all interventions have been evaluated against the same comparators. Outcome measures included log odds of smoking cessation for the meta-regression models and smoking cessation differences and ratios to compare relative effectiveness.

Results

The meta-regression model predicted smoking cessation rates well (pseudo R 2 = 0.44). Standardising the comparator had substantial impact on conclusions regarding the (relative) effectiveness of trials and types of intervention. Compared with a 'no support comparator', self-help was 1.33 times (95% CI = 1.16–1.49), brief physician advice 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.31–1.90), nurse individual counselling 1.76 times (95% CI = 1.62–1.90), psychologist individual counselling 2.04 times (95% CI = 1.95–2.15) and group psychologist interventions 2.06 times (95% CI = 1.92–2.20) more effective. Notably, more elaborate experimental interventions (e.g. psychologist counselling) were typically compared with more elaborate comparators, masking their effectiveness.

Conclusions

Comparator variability and underreporting of comparators obscures the interpretation, comparison and generalisability of behavioural smoking cessation trials. Comparator variability should, therefore, be taken into account when interpreting and synthesising evidence from trials. Otherwise, policymakers, practitioners and researchers may draw incorrect conclusions about the (cost) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions and their constituent components.

### Screening for lung cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114UuozE]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Smoking cessation counseling in screening programs specifies that all persons enrolled in a screening program who are current smokers should receive smoking cessation interventions; to be consistent with the USPSTF recommendation on counseling and interventions to prevent tobacco use and tobacco-caused disease, persons referred for lung cancer screening through primary care should receive these interventions concurrent with referral, and because many persons may enter screening through pathways besides referral from primary care, the USPSTF encourages incorporating such interventions into all screening programs.

### Aligning the work of two U.S. task forces on behavioral counseling recommendations [^113YPZTY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although the scope and mandates of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) differ, there are many similarities in the methods and approaches used to select topics and make recommendations to their key stakeholders. Behavioral counseling interventions represent an important domain for both Task Forces, given the importance of behavior change in promoting health. This paper explores opportunities for greater alignment between the two Task Forces and compares and contrasts the groups and their current approaches to making recommendations that involve behavioral counseling interventions.

For this paper, we define behavioral counseling interventions broadly, to include interventions designed specifically to modify or reinforce health-promoting behaviors in a person or population. In the clinical setting, this is most often one-on-one counseling in primary care or referable ancillary services outside of the clinical setting (e.g. tobacco quitlines) using specific state-of-the-art techniques such as motivation-based interviewing that assesses readiness to change and focuses on goal setting. In the community setting, behavioral interventions are more diverse and can include one-on-one interactions, group-focused interventions, community media campaigns, multicomponent interventions, and economic incentives to change behavior.

### Estimating the true effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions under variable comparator conditions: a systematic review and meta-regression [^111kDewU]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates three key points. First, at the level of individual trials, if you compare the trials by their reported effect size (take the individual nurse counselling trials in Figure 3C) and then examine their re‐estimated effect sizes after standardising the comparator (take the 'no support' comparator), conclusions about which trial tests the most promising intervention can change substantially. This shows that effect sizes of trials evaluating the same type of intervention cannot be directly compared without detailed knowledge of their comparators. Note that there are some reported effect sizes (trials on the left) that are much larger than the re‐estimated effect size with a 'no support' comparator. This may be because of an exceptional synergy of intervention components and/or sample characteristics not captured by our model, reporting bias or chance (e.g. sample sizes of these trials tend to be small). High‐quality replications of those intervention trials seem warranted.

Second, as we move from left to right through the seven re‐estimated effect sizes within each trial, effect sizes become smaller and often even negative — in particular for scenarios in which self‐help or brief interventions are compared with elaborate comparators more commonly used in individual or group counselling trials (mainly in Figure 3A–C). This is also evident in the aggregated effect sizes for each prototypical intervention (boxplots within each panel), which includes first the reported and then the seven re‐estimated effect sizes for each prototypical intervention. For self‐help interventions, for example, the aggregated reported effect size is 0.06 (95% CI = 0.02–0.11), but the re‐estimated effect size against the comparator using group counselling is negative (−0.06 [95% CI = −0.08 to −0.05]).

### Telephone counselling for smoking cessation [^1174mkch]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Telephone services can provide information and support for smokers. Counselling may be provided proactively or offered reactively to callers to smoking cessation helplines.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of proactive and reactive telephone support via helplines and in other settings to help smokers quit.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for studies of telephone counselling, using search terms including 'hotlines' or 'quitline' or 'helpline'. Date of the most recent search: May 2013.

Selection Criteria

randomized or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which proactive or reactive telephone counselling to assist smoking cessation was offered to smokers or recent quitters.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author identified and data extracted trials, and a second author checked them. The main outcome measure was the risk ratio for abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We selected the strictest measure of abstinence, using biochemically validated rates where available. We considered participants lost to follow-up to be continuing smokers. Where trials had more than one arm with a less intensive intervention we used only the most similar intervention without the telephone component as the control group in the primary analysis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity amongst subgroups of clinically comparable studies using the I² statistic. We considered trials recruiting callers to quitlines separately from studies recruiting in other settings. Where appropriate, we pooled studies using a fixed-effect model. We used a meta-regression to investigate the effect of differences in planned number of calls, selection for motivation, and the nature of the control condition (self help only, minimal intervention, pharmacotherapy) in the group of studies recruiting in non-quitline settings.

Main Results

Seventy-seven trials met the inclusion criteria. Some trials were judged to be at risk of bias in some domains but overall we did not judge the results to be at high risk of bias. Among smokers who contacted helplines, quit rates were higher for groups randomized to receive multiple sessions of proactive counselling (nine studies, > 24,000 participants, risk ratio (RR) for cessation at longest follow-up 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.50). There was mixed evidence about whether increasing the number of calls altered quit rates but most trials used more than two calls. Three studies comparing different counselling approaches during a single quitline contact did not detect significant differences. Of three studies that tested the provision of access to a hotline two detected a significant benefit and one did not. Telephone counselling not initiated by calls to helplines also increased quitting (51 studies, > 30,000 participants, RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.36). In a meta-regression controlling for other factors the effect was estimated to be slightly larger if more calls were offered, and in trials that specifically recruited smokers motivated to try to quit. The relative extra benefit of counselling was smaller when it was provided in addition to pharmacotherapy (usually nicotine replacement therapy) than when the control group only received self-help material or a brief intervention. A further eight studies were too diverse to contribute to meta-analyses and are discussed separately. Two compared different intensities of counselling, both of which detected a dose response; one of these detected a benefit of multiple counselling sessions over a single call for people prescribed bupropion. The others tested a variety of interventions largely involving offering telephone counselling as part of a referral or systems change and none detected evidence of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Proactive telephone counselling aids smokers who seek help from quitlines. Telephone quitlines provide an important route of access to support for smokers, and call-back counselling enhances their usefulness. There is limited evidence about the optimal number of calls. Proactive telephone counselling also helps people who receive it in other settings. There is some evidence of a dose response; one or two brief calls are less likely to provide a measurable benefit. Three or more calls increase the chances of quitting compared to a minimal intervention such as providing standard self-help materials, or brief advice, or compared to pharmacotherapy alone.

### Smoking reduction interventions for smoking cessation [^115CJT8U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The standard way most people are advised to stop smoking is by quitting abruptly on a designated quit day. However, many people who smoke have tried to quit many times and may like to try an alternative method. Reducing smoking behaviour before quitting could be an alternative approach to cessation. However, before this method can be recommended it is important to ensure that abrupt quitting is not more effective than reducing to quit, and to determine whether there are ways to optimise reduction methods to increase the chances of cessation.

Objectives

To assess the effect of reduction-to-quit interventions on long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for studies, using the terms: cold turkey, schedul*, cut* down, cut-down, gradual*, abrupt*, fading, reduc*, taper*, controlled smoking and smoking reduction. We also searched trial registries to identify unpublished studies. Date of the most recent search: 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which people who smoked were advised to reduce their smoking consumption before quitting smoking altogether in at least one trial arm. This advice could be delivered using self-help materials or behavioural support, and provided alongside smoking cessation pharmacotherapies or not. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of less than six months, where participants spontaneously reduced without being advised to do so, where the goal of reduction was not to quit altogether, or where participants were advised to switch to cigarettes with lower nicotine levels without reducing the amount of cigarettes smoked or the length of time spent smoking. We also excluded trials carried out in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking cessation was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking cessation for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison (no smoking cessation treatment, abrupt quitting interventions, and other reduction-to-quit interventions) and carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. We also extracted data on quit attempts, pre-quit smoking reduction, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and meta-analysed these where sufficient data were available.

Main Results

We identified 51 trials with 22,509 participants. Most recruited adults from the community using media or local advertising. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked an average of 23 cigarettes a day. We judged 18 of the studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to the five studies at low or to the 28 studies at unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results. We identified very low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision, comparing the effect of reduction-to-quit interventions with no treatment on cessation rates (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.38; I² = 45%; 6 studies, 1599 participants). However, when comparing reduction-to-quit interventions with abrupt quitting (standard care) we found evidence that neither approach resulted in superior quit rates (RR 1. 01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.17; I² = 29%; 22 studies, 9219 participants). We judged this estimate to be of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Subgroup analysis provided some evidence (P = 0.01, I² = 77%) that reduction-to-quit interventions may result in more favourable quit rates than abrupt quitting if varenicline is used as a reduction aid. Our analysis comparing reduction using pharmacotherapy with reduction alone found low-certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency and imprecision, that reduction aided by pharmacotherapy resulted in higher quit rates (RR 1. 68, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.58; I² = 78%; 11 studies, 8636 participants). However, a significant subgroup analysis (P < 0.001, I² = 80% for subgroup differences) suggests that this may only be true when fast-acting NRT or varenicline are used (both moderate-certainty evidence) and not when nicotine patch, combination NRT or bupropion are used as an aid (all low- or very low-quality evidence). More evidence is likely to change the interpretation of the latter effects. Although there was some evidence from within-study comparisons that behavioural support for reduction to quit resulted in higher quit rates than self-help resources alone, the relative efficacy of various other characteristics of reduction-to-quit interventions investigated through within- and between-study comparisons did not provide any evidence that they enhanced the success of reduction-to-quit interventions. Pre-quit AEs, SAEs and nicotine withdrawal symptoms were measured variably and infrequently across studies. There was some evidence that AEs occurred more frequently in studies that compared reduction using pharmacotherapy versus no pharmacotherapy; however, the AEs reported were mild and usual symptoms associated with NRT use. There was no clear evidence that the number of people reporting SAEs, or changes in withdrawal symptoms, differed between trial arms.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that neither reduction-to-quit nor abrupt quitting interventions result in superior long-term quit rates when compared with one another. Evidence comparing the efficacy of reduction-to-quit interventions with no treatment was inconclusive and of low certainty. There is also low-certainty evidence to suggest that reduction-to-quit interventions may be more effective when pharmacotherapy is used as an aid, particularly fast-acting NRT or varenicline (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence for any adverse effects of reduction-to-quit interventions was sparse, but available data suggested no excess of pre-quit SAEs or withdrawal symptoms. We downgraded the evidence across comparisons due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Future research should aim to match any additional components of multicomponent reduction-to-quit interventions across study arms, so that the effect of reduction can be isolated. In particular, well-conducted, adequately-powered studies should focus on investigating the most effective features of reduction-to-quit interventions to maximise cessation rates.

### Counseling is effective for smoking cessation in head and neck cancer patients – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11617Exd]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the efficacy of smoking cessation counseling and the resulting quit rate in patients with head and neck cancer.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Predictor variables were smoking cessation counseling and smoking cessation interventions. The outcome was smoking cessation. Data collection and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 of the authors. Selected publications were assessed for potential risk of bias, and the level of evidence was evaluated using National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. Review Manager 5.3 was used to conduct the meta-analysis.

Results

Eight studies involving 1,239 patients were included (3 randomized controlled trials, 3 cohorts, and 2 case series). Smoking cessation was achieved considerably more often in patients who received smoking cessation counseling compared with those who received usual care.

Conclusions

This review shows that counseling supplemented with nicotine replacement therapy increases the possibility for smoking cessation in patients with head and neck cancer.

### Smoking cessation interventions for patients with depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112UjCxd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic literature review of smoking cessation interventions for patients with histories of depressive disorders or current significant depressive symptoms. We examined the comparative effectiveness of smoking cessation strategies on abstinence rates, differential effects of cessation strategies by depression status (i.e., history positive vs. current depression), and differential effects by gender.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed literature in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library.

Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants, and Interventions

Randomized controlled trials or secondary analysis of RCT data comparing two or more smoking cessation interventions or intervention to control, and reporting cessation outcomes in adults with depression.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Two trained researchers screened articles for inclusion. When possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals by using a random effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method. We synthesized other studies qualitatively. We classified each intervention as antidepressants, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), brief smoking cessation counseling, smoking cessation behavioral counseling, or behavioral mood management.

Results

We identified 16 unique RCTs, of which, only three trials recruited participants with current depression. Meta-analysis demonstrated a small, positive effect of adding behavioral mood management (RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). All included antidepressant trials showed small, positive effects, but risk ratio summary was not significant (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.73–2.34). Three NRT trials demonstrated small, positive effects on smoking cessation rates. We found insufficient evidence to examine gender and depression status moderator effects.

Limitations

Few RCTs exist that test smoking cessation interventions among adults with depression. To make meaningful comparisons, we created broad intervention categories that contained heterogeneity.

Conclusions and Implications Of Key Findings

Few trials enrolled smokers with current depression. Most of data identified were from subgroup analyses of patients history-positive for depression. However, several promising interventions exist. Healthcare providers should consider encouraging their patients with significant depressive symptoms or depression histories to seek smoking cessation services that include NRT and behavioral mood management.
