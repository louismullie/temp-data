## Question

In electronic health records, how do clinicians' documentation practices regarding patient credibility vary by race?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how clinicians' documentation practices in electronic health records regarding patient credibility vary by race. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely what counts as "questioning credibility" language in clinical documentation. Then, I should confirm whether there is evidence that the use of such language or related skeptical documentation practices differ by race across care settings. Next, I should review mechanisms by which implicit bias may shape documentation and how those notes subsequently transmit bias to other clinicians. After that, I will examine setting-specific manifestations and potential downstream impacts, including algorithmic amplification. Finally, I will synthesize the scope of racial variation and outline practical, evidence-informed documentation strategies that reduce harm while maintaining clinical accuracy [^112AqRaA] [^111JFhbN].

> Let me first confirm the definition and exemplars of credibility-questioning documentation. I need to ensure that we are using the category consistently with the literature: terms like "claims", "alleges", or "insists" to describe patient-reported symptoms implicitly cast doubt on the patient's veracity, whereas neutral phrasing such as "reports" avoids judgmental framing; a commonly cited example is "patient claims she is having abdominal pain" versus "patient reports abdominal pain", the former being stigmatizing and the latter neutral [^112AqRaA]. Hold on, I should verify that this category is embedded within broader stigmatizing language typologies in EHR studies, which it is, alongside stereotyping and disapproval, underscoring that documentation choices can encode clinician bias into the chart [^112AqRaA].

> Next, I should review whether such stigmatizing language, including credibility-questioning phrasing, varies by race across clinical domains. The obstetrics and gynecology consensus review explicitly notes demographic disparities in stigmatizing language within oncology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, and substance use care, identifying "questioning a person's credibility" as a recurrent category in these analyses; this establishes that racial variation in stigmatizing EHR language is a documented phenomenon rather than a hypothetical concern [^112AqRaA]. Wait, let me verify the breadth: these findings come from qualitative and machine learning methods, suggesting stable detection across methodological approaches and reinforcing concerns about differential labeling of similar patient-reported symptoms by race [^112AqRaA].

> I will now examine related documentation behaviors that, while not always literal wording like "claims", functionally question credibility, especially around pain and opioid management. In a VA cohort on chronic opioid therapy, Black patients had pain documented less frequently in follow-up notes, underwent more urine drug testing at higher opioid doses, and were less likely to be referred to pain specialists while being more often referred for substance use assessment, collectively encoding suspicion and doubt into the record and care plan [^115YVysk]. Wait, I should double-check: this study evaluates documentation frequency and monitoring patterns rather than directly counting skeptical words, but the monitoring asymmetry and selective documentation align with credibility-questioning practices in how records portray and act upon patient-reported pain [^115YVysk].

> But wait, what if documentation disparities also emerge in diagnostic entries rather than only in symptom narratives. Let me consider obstetric imaging–validated diagnoses: an NLP-based analysis of fibroid uterus in pregnancy found that Black patients were more likely to have late or missing EHR documentation of the diagnosis despite radiologic confirmation, implying that symptom credibility and diagnostic salience may be differentially captured and codified across races in obstetric care [^111X4djd]. Hold on, I should verify that this reflects a documentation gap rather than disease prevalence differences; the comparison was within radiologically confirmed cases, supporting a true documentation disparity signal [^111X4djd].

> Next, I should review social commentary in critical care pediatrics as another vector for credibility judgments. In NICU notes, social commentary about families most often read as neutral, but negative ratings were significantly more frequent for American Indian/Alaska Native patients' families than for others, indicating the encoding of negative attributions into chart narratives that shape subsequent clinician perceptions of caregiver credibility and reliability [^115KRyrR]. Hmm, wait a minute, this is about family-level commentary rather than symptom credibility per se, but the mechanism — negative social framing transmitting bias forward — is analogous and clinically consequential for care decisions and trust [^115KRyrR].

> I need to check mechanisms now: how do implicit biases translate into documentation that questions credibility. Systematic and experimental work shows that clinician implicit racial bias is associated with altered decision-making and communication patterns, including language choices and anxiety-related word use in racially discordant encounters, which plausibly manifests in note phrasing and emphasis [^112Pqs37] [^114bg8ek] [^114qMuaU]. Hold on, I should verify that altered language is explicitly observed; indeed, clinicians with higher implicit bias used more anxiety-related words like "worry" and "nervous" in interactions with Black patients, a signal likely to be reflected in contemporaneous or subsequent documentation and to shape how future clinicians interpret the patient's account [^114qMuaU].

> Let me now confirm whether biased documentation actually transmits harm to subsequent clinicians. A randomized vignette trial showed that reading a prior note containing stigmatizing language led physicians-in-training to hold more negative attitudes and to provide less aggressive pain management for an otherwise identical patient, thereby demonstrating a causal path from stigmatizing language to downstream clinical decisions; this is the key evidence that EHR language functions as a vehicle for bias transmission [^111JFhbN]. Wait, I nearly overextended and implied this study quantified real-world rates of stigmatizing language; to be precise, it tested the effect of exposure to such language, not its prevalence, so I should couple it to observational disparities work for a full picture [^111JFhbN] [^112AqRaA].

> Next, I should review how these patterns vary by clinical context. In emergency and pain settings, particularly with conditions like sickle cell disease, credibility of pain reports is frequently contested, and when such skepticism is documented or encoded via intensified monitoring, it creates a high-risk loop for undertreatment and stigma that is then read by subsequent teams [^111JFhbN] [^115YVysk]. In obstetrics, delayed or missing documentation of significant comorbidities among Black patients, together with documented disparities in stigmatizing language use in pregnancy care, compounds risk and erodes trust in clinician–patient relationships [^111X4djd] [^112AqRaA]. Let me also consider digital amplification: when biased free text feeds NLP or downstream algorithms, inequities can be silently propagated or magnified in decision support or risk stratification systems, further entrenching differential credibility judgments at scale [^112w7HkZ] [^1143jPyC].

> I should now synthesize the scope of racial variation across the evidence base. Across multiple settings, Black patients are more likely to have their pain under-documented, to be monitored and referred in ways that signal suspicion, and to experience late or missing diagnostic entries relative to objective findings; Latinx patients face higher rates of stigmatizing EHR language use; American Indian/Alaska Native families receive more negatively framed social commentary in NICU notes; by contrast, White patients are more often described with neutral language, experience more straightforward specialty referral patterns, and avoid the additive burden of suspicion communicated in charts, acknowledging that not all studies directly measure wording frequency but converge on documentation that differentially questions credibility by race [^112AqRaA] [^115YVysk] [^111X4djd] [^115KRyrR] [^111JFhbN]. Hold on, I should verify that conflating documentation content and care processes is justified here; the linkage is supported both by direct language typologies and by encoded behaviors that express doubt, each of which is preserved in the EHR and influences subsequent care [^112AqRaA] [^111JFhbN].

> Let me consider the impact pathway so I do not jump to conclusions without articulating the chain. First, implicit bias shapes narrative choices and documentation emphasis, including credibility-questioning phrasing or proxy behaviors such as selective monitoring; second, those records are read and trusted by future teams, altering attitudes and treatment intensity as demonstrated experimentally; third, NLP and algorithmic tools trained on biased notes may perpetuate or exacerbate disparities unless mitigated, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of inequity that degrades outcomes and trust [^111JFhbN] [^112nkxZg] [^1143jPyC]. I should double-check that algorithmic harms are not hypothetical; multiple reviews document both exacerbation and mitigation of disparities by healthcare algorithms, underscoring the need to treat documentation bias as an upstream data quality and equity problem [^112nkxZg] [^112w7HkZ].

> Now, I need to translate this into concrete clinical documentation guidance, while verifying that recommendations align with evidence. Use neutral, person-centered phrasing for symptoms ("reports" rather than "claims"), avoid editorializing social commentary, and focus notes on objective findings and patient-prioritized concerns to prevent seeding downstream bias; this aligns with relationship-centered care principles that counteract stigmatizing language and foster equity in obstetric and general care contexts [^112AqRaA]. Let me reconsider structural levers: simple EHR changes such as structured fields increase completeness for sensitive domains like sexual orientation and gender identity, and structured templates for serious illness conversations can steer documentation toward clinically relevant content and away from subjective editorializing, though free text still captures important nuances and must be written carefully [^116bGXjs] [^114KXqSH]. Finally, I should not overlook team-level bias reduction strategies; peer-networked feedback and iterative review have experimentally reduced race and gender bias in treatment recommendations, suggesting that feedback on note language and referral patterns may similarly attenuate credibility-questioning documentation over time [^113KsfCz].

> In sum, I should confirm that the evidence supports a consistent conclusion: documentation practices that question patient credibility vary by race, with Black, Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native patients disproportionately subjected to stigmatizing phrasing, under-documentation of symptoms or diagnoses, and suspicious monitoring or referrals; these entries transmit bias to subsequent clinicians and risk algorithmic amplification, contributing to inequitable care, whereas neutral, structured, and relationship-centered documentation coupled with bias-mitigation strategies offers a path to reduce harm [^112AqRaA] [^115YVysk] [^111X4djd] [^115KRyrR] [^111JFhbN] [^1143jPyC] [^112nkxZg]. Hold on, I should verify I did not overstate causality in observational segments; where causality is claimed it rests on the randomized vignette experiment for downstream effects, while the racial patterning of documentation and monitoring behaviors arises from observational studies that are consistent and plausibly mechanistic when integrated with implicit bias research [^111JFhbN] [^112Pqs37] [^114bg8ek] [^114qMuaU].

Clinician documentation in EHRs differs by race [^112AqRaA], with **Black and Hispanic patients more often described with stigmatizing, credibility-questioning language** (e.g. "claims", "insists", "adamant") than White patients. This language is linked to **less aggressive pain management and more frequent substance use referrals** for Black patients, while White patients receive more pain specialist referrals. Implicit bias contributes to these patterns [^112Pqs37], and stigmatizing documentation can perpetuate bias in subsequent care [^111JFhbN] [^115KRyrR]. Standardized, **bias-aware documentation** [^111iE831] and **clinician training** [^1143jPyC] are needed to reduce these disparities.

---

### Evidence of racial differences in clinician documentation

- **Stigmatizing language**: Black and Hispanic patients' records [^112AqRaA] more often contain credibility-questioning terms (e.g. "claims", "insists", "adamant") than White patients.
- **Pain management documentation**: Black patients' pain is documented less frequently, and they undergo more urine drug testing [^115YVysk], while White patients are more often referred to pain specialists.
- **Substance use documentation**: Black patients are more likely to be referred for substance abuse assessment [^115YVysk], reflecting implicit bias in documentation and care [^112Pqs37].

---

### Impact of clinician bias on documentation

Implicit bias shapes documentation [^112Pqs37], **influencing language and care** and contributing to disparities. The **transmission of bias** [^115KRyrR] occurs when stigmatizing language in records leads to negative attitudes and less aggressive care from subsequent clinicians [^111JFhbN].

---

### Consequences of biased documentation

Biased documentation has **significant clinical consequences**, affecting **clinical decision-making** [^112Pqs37] — stigmatizing language leads to less aggressive pain management [^111JFhbN] and more substance use referrals for Black patients [^115YVysk]. Patient **trust and engagement** also suffer, as biased documentation erodes trust and reduces engagement, worsening outcomes [^116FMZGb].

---

### Strategies to address documentation bias

To reduce bias, **standardized, bias-aware documentation** is needed:

- **Standardized documentation**: Use structured, bias-aware templates to reduce subjective language [^116bGXjs] [^114KXqSH].
- **Clinician training**: Provide implicit bias training to improve documentation and care [^114qMuaU].
- **Patient engagement**: Involve patients in reviewing records to identify and correct bias [^111KZF4x].

Clinician documentation of patient credibility differs by race [^112AqRaA], with **Black and Hispanic patients more often described with stigmatizing, credibility-questioning language** than White patients. This bias affects clinical decisions and outcomes [^112Pqs37], and addressing it requires standardized documentation, clinician training, and patient engagement [^114qMuaU].

### Do words matter? Stigmatizing language and the transmission of bias in the medical record [^111JFhbN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Clinician bias contributes to healthcare disparities, and the language used to describe a patient may reflect that bias. Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, no studies have evaluated patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another.

- **Objective**: To assess whether stigmatizing language written in a patient medical record is associated with a subsequent physician-in-training's attitudes towards the patient and clinical decision-making.

- **Design**: Randomized vignette study of two chart notes employing stigmatizing versus neutral language to describe the same hypothetical patient, a 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease.

- **Participants**: A total of 413 physicians-in-training: medical students and residents in internal and emergency medicine programs at an urban academic medical center (54% response rate).

- **Main measures**: Attitudes towards the hypothetical patient using the previously validated Positive Attitudes Towards Sickle Cell Patients Scale (range 7–35) and pain management decisions (residents only) using two multiple-choice questions (composite range 2–7 representing intensity of pain treatment).

- **Key results**: Exposure to the stigmatizing language note was associated with more negative attitudes towards the patient (20.6 stigmatizing vs. 25.6 neutral, p < 0.001). Furthermore, reading the stigmatizing language note was associated with less aggressive management of the patient's pain (5.56 stigmatizing vs. 6.22 neutral, p = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: Stigmatizing language used in medical records can potentially influence clinician attitudes and patient management decisions.

### Racial disparities in the monitoring of patients on chronic opioid therapy [^115YVysk]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Despite well-documented racial disparities in prescribing opioid medications for pain, little is known about whether there are disparities in the monitoring and follow-up treatment of patients who are prescribed opioid medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine whether there are racial differences in the use of recommended opioid monitoring and follow-up treatment practices. Our sample included 1,646 white and 253 black patients who filled opioid prescriptions for noncancer pain for ≥ 90 consecutive days at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System pharmacy in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Several opioid monitoring and follow-up treatment practices were extracted from electronic health records for a 12-month follow-up period.

Findings indicated that 26.3% of patients had opioid agreements on file, pain was documented in 71.7% of primary care follow-up visits, urine drug tests were administered to 49.3% of patients, and 21.2% and 4.2% of patients were referred to pain and substance abuse specialists, respectively. Racial differences were observed in several of these practices. In adjusted comparisons, pain was documented less frequently for black patients than for white patients. Among those who had at least one urine drug test, black patients were subjected to more tests, especially if they were on higher doses of opioids. Compared with white patients, black patients were less likely to be referred to a pain specialist and more likely to be referred for substance abuse assessment. Addressing disparities in opioid monitoring and follow-up treatment is crucial to ensure equitable healthcare outcomes.

### The power of language in hospital care for pregnant and birthing people: A vision for change [^112AqRaA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Clinician documentation of stigmatizing language in the electronic health record (EHR) has also been studied. Demographic disparities in stigmatizing language use have been identified in the EHRs of Black and Latinx people in oncology, the emergency department, internal medicine, and substance use care. These studies used qualitative and machine learning methods to identify categories of stigmatizing language such as stereotyping (highlighting unsophisticated terms, e.g. "states the wound 'busted open'"), disapproval (e.g. "patient adamantly declined weekly testing"), and questioning a person's credibility (e.g. "patient claims she is having abdominal pain"). Recent research has begun to qualitatively examine stigmatizing language in the EHR in pregnancy and birth settings.

Stigmatizing language use hinders the development of authentic relationships between pregnant people and clinicians, contributing to inequity. The relationship-centered care framework describes four principles to improve clinical relationships:

- **Uniqueness and life experiences**: Clinicians should acknowledge each person's uniqueness and life experiences, with a focus on internal and externally expressed authenticity.

- **Empathy over detachment**: Clinicians should use empathy, instead of a detached or neutral approach to people seeking care, and demonstrate empathy through their affect and emotion.

- **Reciprocal influence**: Relationships require reciprocal influence and can benefit both the person seeking care and the clinician.

- **Moral basis**: There is a moral basis to relationships between people seeking care and clinicians, centering genuine relationships between humans.

### A systematic review of the impact of physician implicit racial bias on clinical decision making [^112Pqs37]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Disparities in diagnosis and treatment of racial minorities exist in the emergency department (ED). A better understanding of how physician implicit (unconscious) bias contributes to these disparities may help identify ways to eliminate such racial disparities. The objective of this systematic review was to examine and summarize the evidence on the association between physician implicit racial bias and clinical decision making.

- **Methods**: Based on PRISMA guidelines, a structured electronic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Eligible studies were those that: 1) included physicians, 2) included the Implicit Association Test as a measure of implicit bias, 3) included an assessment of physician clinical decision making, and 4) were published in peer-reviewed journals between 1998 and 2016. Articles were reviewed for inclusion by two independent investigators. Data extraction was performed by one investigator and checked for accuracy by a second investigator. Two investigators independently scored the quality of articles using a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist.

- **Results**: Of the 1,154 unique articles identified in the initial search, nine studies (n = 1,910) met inclusion criteria. Three of the nine studies involved emergency providers, including residents, attending physicians, and advanced practice providers. The majority of studies used clinical vignettes to examine clinical decision making. Studies that included emergency medicine (EM) providers had vignettes relating to treatment of acute myocardial.

### Research priorities for interventions to address health disparities in lung nodule management: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114qMuaU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Racial or ethnic concordance between patients and their healthcare providers is associated with higher patient experience scores. It is unclear whether and how clinician characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity, years of education, specialty, years since completion of training, or practice setting affect disparities in lung nodule evaluation. The committee acknowledged that practice setting might affect access to diagnostic procedures, diagnostic biomarker testing, and expert review and input regarding management.

Little is known about the role of implicit bias or stereotypes in disparities in lung nodule evaluation. In lung cancer screening, women may be less likely than men to have discussed lung cancer screening with their clinicians, suggesting an implicit gender bias. In mammography screening for breast cancer, where abnormal imaging results and false-positive results are common, perceived discrimination was associated with significant diagnostic delays.

Studies on patients with advanced cancer showed that higher degrees of oncologist implicit racial bias were associated with shorter patient interactions, less patient-centered and supportive communication, and more patient difficulty remembering the contents of the interaction. In primary care, physicians' implicit racial bias was associated with more frequent use of first-person pronouns, which may suggest a sense of social dominance, and anxiety-related words such as "worry" and "nervous", highlighting the potential role of anxiety in racially discordant interactions.

### A question of trust: Does mistrust or perceived discrimination account for race disparities in advance directive completion [^111KjFmu]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

Interactions between patients and health care providers may be shaped by structural discrimination and contribute to lower rates of advance directive completion by black older adults. Physicians tend to spend clinical time differently and employ different communication styles depending on whether the patient is white or black. The "racial framing" of health care services provided by a predominantly white medical profession may lead to systemic race disparities in how advance care planning (ACP) information and assistance are offered, based on implicit assumptions about patients' receptivity or abilities. These biases and accompanying differential treatment may be unrecognized by both patients and providers.

Although black participants were more likely to report experiencing different forms of discriminatory treatment, neither perceived discrimination nor mistrust in health care providers explained race differences in advance directive completion. These results call into question the common assertion that mistrust accounts for lower rates of ACP by older blacks. Future research should examine the potential relationships between ACP and other dimensions of discrimination.

We still do not fully understand the barriers that contribute to lower rates of ACP by black older adults as well as other diverse race populations. Finding answers will require a careful examination of the historical context of health, health outcomes, access to resources, and acceptability of treatment among these groups. Advancing the literature in this area allows for a more thorough exploration of the many social and behavioral factors affecting these disparities.

### Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in cancer care: Addressing disparities, bias, and data diversity [^1143jPyC]. Cancer Discovery (2022). High credibility.

Health provider expertise and practice delivery are an integral part of generating and translating evidence into cancer clinical care for improved health and outcomes. Data that are transcribed into EHR systems for patient care, administrative claims, and cancer databases inform predictive, prognostic, and risk algorithms in cancer care. A patient may arrive at a medical facility with symptoms, and the primary care practitioner will determine the course of action based on their assessment and beliefs, often in combination with tumor biomarkers, lab results, or imaging data. They may combine sources of patient-generated data with professional guidelines, including evidence-based practices, to make treatment decisions. The cancer care management and treatment plan can be based on a thorough examination of the patient, listening to their story, and understanding their values, preferences, culture, beliefs, and life experiences. However, actions can also include unconscious (or conscious) bias, stemming either from experience with a cohort of similar patients or from the practitioner's own stereotypes or other influences.

Unconscious bias may rely on stereotypes and lead to discriminatory practices. Actions influenced by compassion or values for equity and fairness can help drive and ensure patient satisfaction and optimal health outcomes. Addressing unconscious bias and promoting patient-centered care are important aspects for promoting AI–ML fairness, optimizing algorithmic bias, and achieving cancer health equity. Training in cultural competency is critical in this context.

### Physician perspectives on responding to clinician-perpetuated interpersonal racism against Black patients with serious illness [^117EP9vT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Racism negatively affects clinical outcomes in Black patients, but uncertainty remains among physicians regarding how to address interpersonal anti-Black racism incidences involving them to facilitate racial healing and promote accountability.

- **Objective**: Elicit physician perspectives on addressing concerns from Black patients about interpersonal racism involving them or their team.

- **Participants**: Twenty-one physician subspecialists at an urban academic medical center.

- **Approach**: We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews to help inform the development of a clinician-facing component of a program to address the distress of racism experienced by Black patients with serious illness. We asked clinicians to describe experiences discussing racism with patients and identify additional resources to support these conversations.

- **Main measures**: Physician perspectives, including barriers and facilitators, to promote racial healing and clinician accountability when discussing clinician-perpetuated interpersonal racism with Black patients.

- **Key results**: Of the 21 participating physicians, 67% were women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean of 10.8 years of experience as an attending physician. Four identified as Asian, three identified as Black, and 14 identified as White. Participants largely felt unprepared to discuss racism with their patients, especially if the harm was caused by them or their team. Participants felt patients should be given tools to discuss concerns about racism with their clinicians, but worried about adding additional burdens to Black patients.

### Race-based medicine in the point-of-care clinical resource UpToDate: A systematic content analysis [^1145SnqX]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Race-based practices in medical education and clinical care may exacerbate health inequities. Misguided use of race in popular point-of-care clinical decision-making tools like UpToDate® may promote harmful practices of race-based medicine. This article investigates the nature of mentions of Black/African American race in UpToDate®.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic content analysis of UpToDate® articles mentioning Black or African American race to assess for biological interpretations of racial categories. Following a simple text search for the terms "Black" and "African American" in UpToDate® on January 24 and March 19, 2020, respectively, removal of duplicates yielded an analytical sample of 208 documents. We adopted a deductive coding approach and systematically applied 16 a priori codes to all documents, refining the codebook to achieve a final inter-rater reliability of 0.91. We then developed these codes into two themes: (1) biologization of race and (2) racialized research and practice.

- **Findings**: Biologization of race occurred nearly universally across all documents (93.3%), with discussions of inherent physiological differences between racial groups and presentation of epidemiologic disparities without context emerging most frequently. Sixty-eight documents (32.7%) included codes related to racialized biomedical research and clinical practice, including references to racialized patterns of behavior and cultural practices, insufficient data on Black populations, research limiting study to a specific racial group, and race-based clinical practices guidance.

### Cannabis use assessment and documentation in healthcare: Priorities for closing the gap [^115UGpxo]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Several factors, including the lack of a systematic cannabis use assessment within healthcare systems, have led to significant under-documentation of cannabis use and its correlates in medical records. This has resulted in the unpreparedness of clinicians and poor quality of cannabis-related electronic health record data, limiting its utilization in research. Multiple steps are required to overcome the existing knowledge gaps and accommodate the health needs implied by the increasing cannabis use prevalence. These steps include:

- **Enhancing clinician and patient education**: Educate on the importance of cannabis use assessment and documentation.
- **Implementing a standardized approach**: Develop comprehensive cannabis use assessment methods within and across healthcare systems.
- **Improving documentation**: Improve records of cannabis use and its correlates in medical and electronic health records by building in prompts.
- **Developing computable phenotypes**: Develop and validate reliable computable phenotypes of cannabis use.
- **Conducting research utilizing electronic health data**: Use this data to study a wide array of related health outcomes.
- **Establishing evidence-based guidelines**: Formulate guidelines to inform clinical practices and policies.

Integrating comprehensive cannabis use assessment and documentation within healthcare systems is necessary to enhance patient care and improve the quality of electronic health databases. Employing electronic health record data in cannabis-related research is crucial to accelerate research in light of the existing knowledge gaps on a wide array of health outcomes.

### Use of patient identifiers at the University of Washington School of Medicine: Building institutional consensus to reduce bias and stigma [^111iE831]. Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patient identifiers are used in the opening lines of case presentations and written documentation in healthcare and medical education settings. These identifiers can reflect physicians' implicit biases, which are known to impact patient care. Yet, no clear recommendations for the use of patient identifiers to reduce bias and stigma in patient care and medical education learning environments currently exist. We describe a process and outcomes for articulating such recommendations.

- **Methods**: The University of Washington School of Medicine convened a group of diverse stakeholders to create patient identifier recommendations for use in the undergraduate medical education program. After a literature review, 22 recommendations for the use of patient identifiers were articulated. These underwent public comment periods reaching 11,150 potential respondents across our five-state institution. Feedback from 437 respondents informed modifications to the recommendations. We used consensus methodology with three rounds of surveys and an expert group of 27 stakeholders to adopt recommendations with an a priori threshold of 90% agreeing the recommendation should be used.

- **Results**: We adopted 12 recommendations for patient identifiers for age, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, size, and stigma; nine in round one, three in round two, and none in the third round.

- **Discussion**: Our institution vetted these patient identifier recommendations via public comment and consensus methodology. Next steps include implementation across the undergraduate medical education program.

### Association of early childhood wheeze and asthma diagnosis documentation by race, ethnicity, and language in children [^114TPjSj]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

To determine whether electronic health record (EHR) documentation of certain early childhood risk factors for asthma, such as wheeze, differs by race, ethnicity, and language group, and whether these children have different subsequent asthma prevalences.

- **Methods**: We used EHR data from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center (ADVANCE) Clinical Research Network. The data includes children receiving care in US community health centers (n = 71,259 children) across 21 states to examine the presence of ICD-coded documentation of early childhood wheeze and its association with subsequent asthma diagnosis documentation in the EHR by race/ethnicity/language.

- **Results**: ICD-coded wheeze was present in 2 to 3% of each race/ethnicity/language group. Among the total sample, 18.5% had asthma diagnosed after age 4. The adjusted prevalence of subsequent asthma diagnosis was greater in children with wheeze than those without. Odds of asthma diagnosis did not differ among children in all race/ethnicity/language groups with early childhood wheeze. However, non-Latino Black children without wheeze had higher odds of asthma (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.08–1.32) compared with non-Latino White children without wheeze.

- **Discussion**: In US community health centers, which serve medically underserved populations, EHR documentation of early childhood wheeze was uncommon and did not differ significantly among race/ethnicity/language groups. Differences in asthma diagnosis in Latino populations may not stem from differences in early-life wheeze documentation. However, our findings suggest that there may be opportunities for improvements in documentation and the understanding of asthma in diverse populations.

### Bias in vital signs? Machine learning models can learn patients' race or ethnicity from the values of vital signs alone [^116DaGe8]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). Low credibility.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are evolving to tackle increasingly complex clinical challenges. The general appeal is that clinical practice will likely benefit from algorithm-assisted decision-making by optimizing clinical workflows, diagnostic interventions, and enhancing personalized precision care. Some insights derived from algorithms will likely assist in clinical decision-making where patients' lives are at risk. Therefore, ML algorithms that become integrated as part of decision-making in clinical practice must be robust, reliable, and unbiased.

Healthcare disparities resulting from discrimination and bias are pervasive. These can be encoded in algorithms trained on clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs). Existing inequities can be perpetuated or even magnified by algorithms developed to inform decision-making due to bias in data used for training the models, bias introduced during model development or deployment, and post-deployment monitoring. Any of these can result in decision-making that can be discriminatory and harmful to socially disadvantaged population groups inadequately represented in the data.

There is overwhelming evidence that race or ethnicity impacts clinical decision-making. Hispanic patients seen by non-Hispanic providers received breast and colorectal cancer screening at higher rates than Hispanic patients seen by Hispanic providers. Greenwood and colleagues reported a 58% reduction in mortality of Black newborns when under the care of Black physicians compared with White physicians. Despite reporting greater pain and pain-

### Mental disorders as risk factors: Assessing the evidence for the Global Burden of Disease Study [^117Wg43Y]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The literature suggests a strong link between childhood psychopathology, such as autistic disorders and behavioral disorders, and increased risks for accidental and self-inflicted injuries. However, inclusion for clinical risk assessment (CRA) is hindered by unrepresentative sampling, such as registry data or small sample sizes, and a lack of data on potential comorbid and environmental risk factors. Common comorbid conditions, including epilepsy and intellectual disability, and environmental factors, such as the family context and unsafe physical environments, may inflate the risk of injury. Obtaining objective data on family and physical environments is difficult and is rarely collected when children with injuries present for treatment.

Determining temporality and establishing which condition precedes the other constitute the greatest areas of contention in establishing an argument for mental disorders as a risk factor. The temporality of onset is subject to bias arising from self-reports of onset and from the use of routinely collected clinical data. Prospective cohort studies, while still subject to some degree of bias, produce the best empirical evidence for temporality in risk factor associations.

Bias can arise from medical records, which document the diagnosis and the start of treatment more accurately than the onset of the disorder. Symptoms of mental disorders and chronic physical health conditions are often present for some time prior to clinical diagnosis. For example, studies based on data linkage of medical records have reported higher…

### The potential for health information technology tools to reduce racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality [^111VUqf2]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Health information technology (health IT) is a promising tool to address racial and ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM). Approximately 60% of maternal deaths are considered preventable, highlighting the importance of such interventions. Interventions that leverage health IT tools to target the underlying drivers of disparities at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels could potentially reduce disparities in quality of care throughout the continuum of maternity care, including antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum phases.

This article presents an overview of the research and the existing gaps concerning the potential of health IT tools. These tools can document social determinants of health (SDoH) and community-level geocoded data in EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems, minimize implicit bias, and improve adherence to clinical guidelines and coordinated care. The aim is to inform multilevel interventions throughout the continuum of maternity care for populations affected by health disparities related to MMM.

Furthermore, telemedicine models are discussed as a means to improve access in rural areas. New technologies for risk assessment and disease management, such as those concerning preeclampsia, are also examined.

### Electronic versus manual data processing: Evaluating the use of electronic health records in out-of-hospital clinical research [^112uMStU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to compare case ascertainment, agreement, validity, and missing values for clinical research data obtained, processed, and linked electronically from electronic health records (EHR) compared to "manual" data processing and record abstraction in a cohort of out-of-hospital trauma patients.

This study was a secondary analysis of two sets of data collected for a prospective, population-based, out-of-hospital trauma cohort evaluated by 10 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies transporting to 16 hospitals, from January 1, 2006, through October 2, 2007. Eighteen clinical, operational, procedural, and outcome variables were collected and processed separately and independently using two parallel data processing strategies by personnel blinded to the patient groups.

The electronic approach included EHR data exports from EMS agencies, reformatting, and probabilistic linkage to outcomes from local trauma registries and state discharge databases. The manual data processing approach involved chart matching, data abstraction, and data entry by a trained abstractor. Descriptive statistics, measures of agreement, and validity were used to compare the two approaches at the time of data processing.

During the 21-month period, 418 patients underwent both data processing methods and formed the primary cohort. Agreement was good to excellent (kappa = 0.76 to 0.97; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.49 to 0.97), with exact agreement in 67% to 99% of cases and a median difference of zero for all continuous and ordinal variables.

### Clinician implicit racial bias and contraceptive counseling in the United States [^1178TcES]. Journal of Women's Health (2025). Low credibility.

Objective: Unequal treatment of patients based on race or ethnicity still exists in reproductive health. One possible reason is clinician bias. While explicit bias has been studied in relation to contraception, the influence of a clinician's implicit bias on contraceptive recommendations has not been examined. We sought to assess the degree of implicit racial bias among reproductive health clinicians and to determine whether bias correlates with recommendations for contraception.

Methods: Clinicians were approached in person at multiple hospitals in New York City and one national conference over a 7-month period. The computer-based study included a demographic survey, clinical vignettes about contraception, and a racial Implicit Association Test. The clinical vignettes were randomized 1:1 to describe either all White patients or all Black patients for each provider. We assessed the likelihood that patient race would factor into contraceptive counseling, looking separately at White and Black clinicians.

Results: Of 500 clinicians invited to participate, 426 completed the survey and were analyzed. They were mostly non-Hispanic, White female attending physicians working in urban areas. White clinicians showed a pro-White bias (p < 0.001), while Black clinicians did not show racial bias in either direction (p = 0.637). White clinicians with pro-White bias were significantly more likely to recommend sterilization to Black patients than to White patients. Implicit racial bias differed based on clinician race, and contraceptive recommendations differed based on their biases.

### Physician perspectives on responding to clinician-perpetuated interpersonal racism against Black patients with serious illness [^1111tmvJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Clinician skills and resources: Many participants reported feeling they did not have the language or skills to discuss racism with their patients. One participant expressed, "I am open to the idea that patients experience racialized healthcare and I would like to be able to have those conversations, but I'm afraid I'll step on a landmine". Participants wanted a framework and accompanying language, stating, "Standard recommendations for these kinds of discussions, like language and framework. How do you have a discussion with someone who feels that you're racist, between a privileged White person and a marginalized patient?" Participants thought patient advocates would be helpful, viewing them as a resource to guide them through their approach, with one physician stating, "I want to be called out if I've communicated in some way that's offending or noncommunicative".

Objective data on subjective experiences: Participants thought clinician-directed anti-racism trainings were important but limited in their ability to advance knowledge and skills in being an anti-racist clinician. They described themselves and their colleagues as data- and evidence-driven, identifying contextually relevant literature as helpful accompanying resources: "Everything is rational, scientific, and evidence-based". Another remarked, "You should provide data for people who are very scientifically minded. Then they may wonder, am I doing that too?" Another physician remarked, "I could imagine data to support self-reflection".

### Clinicians' implicit ethnic/racial bias and perceptions of care among black and Latino patients [^116FMZGb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated whether clinicians' explicit and implicit ethnic/racial bias is related to Black and Latino patients' perceptions of their care in established clinical relationships.

- **Methods**: We administered a telephone survey to 2,908 patients, stratified by ethnicity/race, and randomly selected from the patient panels of 134 clinicians who had previously completed tests of explicit and implicit ethnic/racial bias. Patients completed the Primary Care Assessment Survey, which addressed their clinicians' interpersonal treatment, communication, trust, and contextual knowledge. We created a composite measure of patient-centered care from the four subscales.

- **Results**: Levels of explicit bias were low among clinicians and unrelated to patients' perceptions. Levels of implicit bias varied among clinicians, and those with greater implicit bias were rated lower in patient-centered care by their Black patients compared with a reference group of white patients (P = 0.04). Latino patients gave the clinicians lower ratings than did other groups (P < .0001), and this did not depend on the clinicians' implicit bias (P = 0.98).

- **Conclusions**: This is among the first studies to investigate clinicians' implicit bias and communication processes in ongoing clinical relationships. Our findings suggest that clinicians' implicit bias may jeopardize their clinical relationships with Black patients, which could have negative effects on other care processes. As such, this finding supports the Institute of Medicine's suggestion that clinician bias may contribute to health disparities.

### Conducting real-world evidence studies on the clinical outcomes of diabetes treatments [^113BuSks]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Electronic health records have been heralded as a potential solution to supplement the shortcomings of claims data. EHRs are primarily intended for clinical documentation and encompass a wide range of patient health-related information, including symptoms, results of physical examinations, laboratory tests and procedures, diagnoses, and treatment plans, as well as medical and social history. This data, obtained from multiple clinicians involved in a patient's care, comprises both structured and free text data. EHRs are increasingly used in research as they provide detailed clinical information often missing from claims databases; for example, HbA1c levels can be extracted from EHR data, and the onset of diabetes is frequently recorded in physician notes.

A significant limitation of most EHR data is that only patient health information generated within the provider network maintaining the system will be documented. Consequently, this results in "data leakage", yielding an incomplete picture if a patient's care is fragmented and pertinent information is not electronically shared between providers. Since EHRs were initially designed to support clinical care rather than research, data incompleteness is a common challenge in assuring quality. Moreover, the lack of a universally adopted standard for the data types constituting EHRs results in heterogeneity between systems. Both missing data and between-system heterogeneity must be addressed when designing real-world evidence studies based on EHR data.

### The age-friendly learning healthcare system: Replicating electronic health record based documentation metrics for 4Ms care [^111okhWR]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

We reviewed the measure descriptions with our clinical and biomedical informatics teams and associated Structured Query Language (SQL) code with our biomedical informatics research team. The technical team identified general adaptations necessary for implementation, including adapting the code to be suitable for the relational database management system used at University of Utah Health (Oracle), which differed from the system used at UCSF (Microsoft SQL Server). It was also clear from the beginning that while both institutions used the Epic EHR system, which made the code translation much more facile than if different EHR systems were being used, there would need to be adaptations to local clinical contexts, such as different clinical assessment tools used across the health systems.

To complement our clinical research team consultations, we conducted eight semi‐structured interviews with clinical experts familiar with the EHR documentation related to the inpatient 4Ms care. The clinical experts interviewed included specialists in mobility and rehabilitation assessment and intervention, an emergency department physician, a geriatrician leader in 4Ms implementation in inpatient care, and an RN expert in the delivery of 4Ms care in the UUH outpatient clinics. In these interviews, we discussed the candidate measures designated by the IHI. For example, one validated mobility measure is an Activity Measure for Post‐Acute Care (AMPAC) documentation in the EHR.

### Effect of restriction of the number of concurrently open records in an electronic health record on wrong-patient order errors: A randomized clinical trial [^112gb2cA]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations in the United States suggest limiting the number of patient records displayed in an electronic health record (EHR) to one at a time, although little evidence supports this recommendation. The objective was to assess the risk of wrong-patient orders in an EHR configuration limiting clinicians to one record versus allowing up to four records opened concurrently.

This randomized clinical trial included 3,356 clinicians at a large health system in New York and was conducted from October 2015 to April 2017 in emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient settings. Clinicians were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an EHR configuration limiting to one patient record open at a time (restricted; n = 1,669) or allowing up to four records open concurrently (unrestricted; n = 1,687).

The unit of analysis was the order session, a series of orders placed by a clinician for a single patient. The primary outcome was order sessions that included one or more wrong-patient orders identified by the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder measure (an electronic query that identifies orders placed for a patient, retracted, and then reordered shortly thereafter by the same clinician for a different patient).

Among the 3,356 clinicians who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [12.5] years; mean [SD] experience at study site, 6.5 [6.0] years; 1,894 females [56.4%]), all provided order data and were included in the analysis. The study included 12,140,298 orders, in 4,486,631 order sessions, placed for 543,490 patients.

### The reduction of race and gender bias in clinical treatment recommendations using clinician peer networks in an experimental setting [^1137wBga]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates the changing rates at which clinicians recommended each treatment option: Option A (unsafe undertreatment), Option B (undertreatment), Option C (guideline-recommended treatment), and Option D (overtreatment) for each patient, from initial to final response, across all conditions. We are particularly interested in the inequity of patient care, defined as the rate at which clinicians made an unsafe recommendation (Option A) versus recommending the guideline-recommended treatment (Option C).

Initial responses showed significant inequity between patients. For the Black female patient, 29.9% of clinicians initially recommended the unsafe undertreatment, while only 14.1% recommended the guideline-recommended treatment, resulting in a 15.7 percentage point difference in clinicians recommending unsafe undertreatment over the guideline-recommended treatment. In contrast, for the white male patient, 23.4% of clinicians recommended unsafe undertreatment, while 21.4% recommended the guideline-recommended treatment, leading to a 2 percentage point difference in the likelihood of recommending unsafe undertreatment over the guideline-recommended treatment. This resulted in a 13.7 percentage point difference between the Black female patient and the white male patient in their likelihood of clinicians recommending unsafe undertreatment rather than the guideline-recommended treatment (p = 0.02, n = 28).

### Agreement of ocular symptom reporting between patient-reported outcomes and medical records [^111fJux5]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Accurate documentation of patient symptoms in the electronic medical record (EMR) is crucial for high-quality patient care. This study aimed to explore inconsistencies between patient self-reports on an Eye Symptom Questionnaire (ESQ) and documentation in the EMR.

The investigation was an observational study conducted in comprehensive ophthalmology and cornea clinics at an academic institution. It involved a convenience sample of 192 consecutive eligible patients, of whom 30 declined participation. Patients were recruited at the Kellogg Eye Center from October 1, 2015, to January 31, 2016, and were eligible if they were 18 years or older.

The main focus was on the concordance of symptoms reported on an ESQ with data recorded in the EMR. The agreement of symptom reports was analyzed using κ statistics and McNemar tests. Disagreement was defined as a negative symptom report or lack of mention in the EMR for patients who reported moderate to severe symptoms on the ESQ. Logistic regression was used to investigate if patient factors, physician characteristics, or diagnoses were associated with the probability of disagreement for symptoms of blurry vision, pain or discomfort, and redness.

A total of 162 patients (324 eyes) participated in the study. The mean (SD) age of participants was 56.6 (19.4) years, with 62.3% (101 of 162) being female, and 84.9% (135 of 159) being white. At the participant level, 33.8% (54 of 160) had discordant reporting of blurry vision between the ESQ and EMR. Likewise, documentation was discordant.

### A shared opportunity for improving electronic medical record data [^113VDW1g]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

With the recent rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs), studies reporting results based on EMR data have become increasingly common. While analyzing data extracted from our EMR for a retrospective study, we identified various types of erroneous data entries. This report investigates the root causes of the incompleteness, inconsistency, and inaccuracy of the medical records analyzed in our study.

Experienced health information management professionals are well aware of the many shortcomings with EMR data. The aims of this case study are to highlight the significance of the negative impact of erroneous EMR data, provide fundamental principles for managing EMRs, and offer recommendations to facilitate the successful use of electronic health data, whether to inform clinical decisions or for clinical research.

### Use of natural language processing to uncover racial bias in obstetrical documentation [^111X4djd]. Clinical Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Natural language processing (NLP), a form of artificial intelligence, allows free-text based clinical documentation to be integrated in ways that facilitate data analysis, data interpretation, and formation of individualized medical and obstetrical care. In this cross-sectional study, we identified all births during the study period carrying the radiology-confirmed diagnosis of fibroid uterus in pregnancy (defined as size of largest diameter of > 5 cm) by using an NLP platform and compared it to non-NLP derived data using ICD10 codes of the same diagnosis. We then compared the two sets of data and stratified documentation gaps by race. Using fibroid uterus in pregnancy as a marker, we found that Black patients were more likely to have the diagnosis entered late into the patient's chart or had missing documentation of the diagnosis. With appropriate algorithm definitions, cross-referencing, and thorough validation steps, NLP can contribute to identifying areas of documentation gaps and improve quality of care.

### Transmission of negative biases through social commentary included in neonatal intensive care unit progress notes [^115KRyrR]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine how the perception of families elicited after reading progress note social commentary differs by patient race.

The study design involved a retrospective content analysis of social commentary in physician progress notes for neonatal intensive care unit patients hospitalized from 2018 to 2019. Neonatologists, blinded to patient race, rated how commentary impacted their perception of the patient's family on a 5-point Likert scale. The frequency of negative ratings was compared across reported race using chi-squared tests.

Results showed that we reviewed charts of 460 neonates, of which 225 (49%) contained social commentary beyond parents' names. Twelve neonatologists rated how commentaries impacted their perception of the patient's family; 79%, 18%, and 3% were rated neutrally, negatively, and positively, respectively. The frequency of negative ratings was significantly greater among American Indian/Alaska Native patients than other patients (35% vs. 22%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions indicated that physician documentation of social commentary in patient notes may reflect and perpetuate implicit biases that contribute to race-based healthcare disparities.

### The potential for health information technology tools to reduce racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality [^111xvwtU]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Health information technology (health IT) is potentially a vital lever to address racial and ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM). This is especially relevant given that approximately 60% of maternal deaths are considered preventable. Interventions that leverage health IT tools to target the underlying drivers of disparities at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels could reduce disparities in the quality of care throughout the continuum (antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum) of maternity care.

This article presents an overview of the research (and gaps) on the potential of health IT tools to document social determinants of health (SDoH) and community-level geocoded data in EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems, minimize implicit bias, and improve adherence to clinical guidelines and coordinated care to inform multilevel (patient, clinician, system) interventions throughout the continuum of maternity care for health disparity populations impacted by MMM. Telemedicine models for improving access in rural areas and new technologies for risk assessment and disease management (e.g. regarding preeclampsia) are also discussed.

### Medical student experiences with accessing and entering patient information in electronic health records during the obstetrics-gynecology clerkship [^115AhqFs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Medical school graduates should be able to enter information from patient encounters and write orders and prescriptions in the electronic health record. Studies have shown that, although students often can access electronic health records, some may receive inadequate preparation for these skills. Greater understanding of student exposure to electronic health records during their obstetrics and gynecology clerkships can help determine the extent to which students receive the educational experiences that may best prepare them for their future training and practice.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to examine medical student reporting of electronic health record use during the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship.

- **Study design**: A Step 2 Clinical Knowledge End-of-Examination Survey about electronic health record use was administered to medical students after they completed the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge component of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. For inpatient and outpatient rotations, students were asked if they accessed a record and if they entered notes or orders into it. Descriptive statistics for a sample of 16,366 medical students who graduated from Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited schools from 2012–2016 summarize student interactions with electronic health records by rotation type and graduation year. Chi-square techniques were used to examine mean differences in access and entry.

- **Results**: The survey had an overall response rate of 70%. In 2016, most survey respondents (94%) accessed electronic health records.

### The reduction of race and gender bias in clinical treatment recommendations using clinician peer networks in an experimental setting [^113KsfCz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Networks reduce race and gender bias: Figure 1b shows that in the network conditions, there were significant improvements, from the initial response to the final response, in the accuracy of the assessments given to both the White male patient (p = 0.04, n = 7, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, two-sided; Fig. 1b inset) and the Black female patient (p = 0.01, n = 7 observations, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, two-sided; Fig. 1b inset).

Figure 1d shows that in the network conditions, after two rounds of revision, there was no significant change in the rate at which clinicians recommended the guideline-recommended treatment for the White male patient (p = 0.57, n = 7 observations, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, two-sided; Fig. 1d inset). This lack of change is due to the fact that, regardless of the accuracy of their initial assessments for the White male patient, clinicians were initially significantly more likely to recommend the guideline-recommended treatment for the White male patient (p < 0.01, OR = 1.78, CI = [1.2–2.6], Supplementary Table 7). Consequently, improvements in assessment accuracy for the White male patient had a smaller positive impact on increasing clinicians' likelihood of recommending the guideline-recommended treatment.

By contrast, clinicians were initially significantly less likely to recommend the guideline-recommended treatment for the Black female patient (p < 0.01, OR = 0.56, CI = [0.38–0.83], Supplementary Table 7), while they were significantly more likely to recommend unsafe undertreatment for this patient (p < 0.05, OR = 1.5, CI = [1.08–2.04], Supplementary Table).

### Does "AI" stand for augmenting inequality in the era of COVID-19 healthcare [^112w7HkZ]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

AI technologies rely on large datasets. When biases from existing practices and institutional policies and norms affect those datasets, the algorithmic models they generate will reproduce inequities. In clinical and public health settings, biased judgment and decision-making, as well as discriminatory healthcare processes, policies, and governance regimens, can affect electronic health records, case notes, training curriculums, clinical trials, academic studies, and public health monitoring records. For example, during clinical decision-making, well-established biases against members of marginalized groups, such as African American and LGBT patients, can enter the clinical notes taken by healthcare workers during and after examination or treatment. If these free-text notes are then used by natural language processing technologies to identify symptom profiles or phenotypic characteristics, the real-world biases that inform them will be silently tracked as well.

The datasets which are the basis of data-driven AI and machine learning models thus reflect complex and historically situated practices, norms, and attitudes. This means that inferences drawn from such medical data by AI models used for diagnosis or prognosis might incorporate the biases of previous inequitable practices. This could reinforce or amplify discriminatory structures. Risks of this kind of discrimination creep pose special challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, hospital systems are already using natural language processing technologies and should be aware of these potential biases.

### Physician perspectives on responding to clinician-perpetuated interpersonal racism against Black patients with serious illness [^112SmqzW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Racism negatively affects clinical outcomes in Black patients, but uncertainty remains among physicians regarding how to address interpersonal anti-Black racism incidences involving them, to facilitate racial healing and promote accountability.

- **Objective**: Elicit physician perspectives on addressing concerns from Black patients about interpersonal racism involving them or their team.

- **Participants**: Twenty-one physician subspecialists at an urban academic medical center.

- **Approach**: We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews to help inform the development of a clinician-facing component of a program to address the distress of racism experienced by Black patients with serious illness. Clinicians were asked to describe experiences discussing racism with patients and identify additional resources to support these conversations.

- **Main measures**: Physician perspectives, including barriers and facilitators, to promote racial healing and clinician accountability when discussing clinician-perpetuated interpersonal racism with Black patients.

- **Key results**: Of the 21 participating physicians, 67% were women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean of 10.8 years of experience as an attending physician. Four identified as Asian, three identified as Black, and 14 identified as White. Participants largely felt unprepared to discuss racism with their patients, especially if the harm was caused by them or their team. Participants felt patients should be given tools to discuss concerns about racism with their clinicians but worried about adding additional burdens to Black patients.

### Accuracy of race, ethnicity, and language preference in an electronic health record [^111KZF4x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Collection of data on race, ethnicity, and language preference is required as part of the "meaningful use" of electronic health records (EHRs). These data serve as a foundation for interventions to reduce health disparities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to compare the accuracy of EHR-recorded data on race, ethnicity, and language preference to that reported directly by patients.

- **Design/Subjects/Main measures**: Data collected as part of a tobacco cessation intervention for minority and low-income smokers across a network of 13 primary care clinics (n = 569).

- **Key results**: Patients were more likely to self-report Hispanic ethnicity (19.6% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.001) and African American race (27.0% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001) than was reported in the EHR. Conversely, patients were less likely to complete the survey in Spanish than the language preference noted in the EHR suggested (5.1% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.001). Thirty percent of Whites self-reported identification with at least one other racial or ethnic group, as did 37.0% of Hispanics, and 41.0% of African Americans. Over one-third of EHR-documented Spanish speakers elected to take the survey in English. One-fifth of individuals who took the survey in Spanish were recorded in the EHR as English-speaking.

- **Conclusion**: We demonstrate important inaccuracies and the need for better processes to document race/ethnicity and language preference in EHRs.

### The impact of health care algorithms on racial and ethnic disparities: A systematic review [^112nkxZg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

There is increasing concern for the potential impact of health care algorithms on racial and ethnic disparities.

- **Purpose**: To examine the evidence on how health care algorithms and associated mitigation strategies affect racial and ethnic disparities.

- **Data sources**: Several databases were searched for relevant studies published from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2023.

- **Study selection**: Using predefined criteria and dual review, studies were screened and selected to determine: 1) the effect of algorithms on racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care outcomes, and 2) the effect of strategies or approaches to mitigate racial and ethnic bias in the development, validation, dissemination, and implementation of algorithms.

- **Data extraction**: Outcomes of interest (that is, access to health care, quality of care, and health outcomes) were extracted with risk-of-bias assessment using the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool and adapted CARE-CPM (Critical Appraisal for Racial and Ethnic Equity in Clinical Prediction Models) equity extension.

- **Data synthesis**: Sixty-three studies (51 modeling, 4 retrospective, 2 prospective, 5 pre-post studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial) were included. Heterogeneous evidence on algorithms was found to: a) reduce disparities (for example, the revised kidney allocation system), b) perpetuate or exacerbate disparities (for example, severity-of-illness scores applied to critical care resource allocation), and/or c) have no statistically significant effect on select outcomes (for example, the.

### Racial and ethnic disparity in clinical outcomes among patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in a large US electronic health record database [^1123qxeu]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected by the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, nationwide data on COVID-19 outcomes stratified by race/ethnicity and adjusted for clinical characteristics are sparse. This study analyzed the impacts of race/ethnicity on outcomes among US patients with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in the electronic health record from 01 February 2020 through 14 September 2020. Index encounter site, hospitalization, and mortality were assessed by race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black [Black], non-Hispanic White [White], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], or Other/unknown). Associations between racial/ethnic categories and study outcomes adjusted for patient characteristics were evaluated using logistic regression.

- **Findings**: Among 202,908 patients with confirmed COVID-19, patients from racial/ethnic minority groups were more likely than White patients to be hospitalized on initial presentation (Hispanic: adjusted odds ratio 1.690, 95% CI 1.620–1.763; Black: 1.810, 1.743–1.880; Asian: 1.503, 1.381–1.636) and during follow-up (Hispanic: 1.700, 1.638–1.764; Black: 1.578, 1.526–1.633; Asian: 1.391, 1.288–1.501). Among hospitalized patients, adjusted mortality risk was lower for Black patients (0.881, 0.809–0.959) but higher for Asian patients (1.205, 1.000–1.452).

- **Interpretation**: Racial/ethnic minority patients with COVID-19 had more severe disease on initial presentation than White patients, with increased mortality risks.

### Differences in physicians' verbal and nonverbal communication with Black and White patients at the end of life [^1147Mr1e]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2016). Low credibility.

Black patients are more likely than White patients to die in the intensive care unit with life-sustaining treatments. Differences in patient- and/or surrogate-provider communication may contribute to this phenomenon.

- **Objectives**: To test whether hospital-based physicians use different verbal and/or nonverbal communication with Black and White simulated patients and their surrogates.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized factorial trial of the relationship between patient race and physician communication using high-fidelity simulation. Using a combination of probabilistic and convenience sampling, we recruited 33 hospital-based physicians in western Pennsylvania who completed two encounters with prognostically similar, critically and terminally ill Black and White elders with identical treatment preferences. We then conducted detailed content analysis of audio and video recordings of the encounters, coding verbal emotion-handling and shared decision-making behaviors, and nonverbal behaviors such as time interacting with the patient and/or surrogate, open vs. closed posture, touching the patient, and physical proximity. We used a paired t-test to compare each subject's summed verbal and nonverbal communication scores with the Black patient compared to the White patient.

- **Results**: Subject physicians' verbal communication scores did not differ by patient race (Black vs. White: 8.4 vs. 8.4, P-value = 0.958). However, their nonverbal communication scores were significantly lower with the Black patient than with the White patient (Black vs. White: 2.7 vs. 2.9, P-value 0.0).

In Study 2, patients had a mean age of 56.7 years, ranging from 19 to 85 years. Among them, 39.3% were aged 65 years or older, and 6.1% were 75 years or older. Patients were categorized by sex and US census-based racial and ethnic categories, comprising 69.0% female, 88% White, 8% Black or African American, 4% Asian, and less than 1% from other races.

Primary efficacy endpoints for both studies were changes from baseline to Month 1 and Month 3 in latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and wake after sleep onset (WASO), as measured objectively by polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. LPS evaluates sleep induction, while WASO assesses sleep maintenance.

The secondary endpoint, included in the statistical testing hierarchy with Type 1 error control, was patient-reported total sleep time (sTST). This was evaluated every morning at home using a validated sleep diary questionnaire (SDQ).

In Study 1, doses of 25 and 50 mg of Quviviq demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in polysomnography measures (LPS, WASO) and self-reported total sleep time (sTST) at Month 1 and Month 3.

In Study 2, Quviviq 25 mg showed statistically significant improvements versus placebo on WASO and sTST at Month 1 and Month 3. However, Quviviq 10 mg did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements on LPS, WASO, or sTST at either Month 1 or Month 3.

The efficacy of Quviviq was consistent across subgroups based on age, sex, race, and region. The effects on LPS, WASO, and sTST observed at Month 1 were maintained through Month 3.

### Perceptions of electronic health record implementation: A statewide survey of physicians in Rhode Island [^11775DHX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although electronic health record use improves healthcare delivery, adoption into clinical practice is incomplete. We sought to identify the extent of adoption in Rhode Island and the characteristics of physicians and electronic health records associated with positive experiences.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional study of data collected by the Rhode Island Department of Health for the Health Information Technology Survey 2009 to 2013. Survey questions included provider and practice demographics, health record information, and Likert-type scaled questions regarding how electronic health record use affected clinical practice.

- **Results**: The survey response rate ranged from 50% to 65%, with 62% in 2013. Increasing numbers of physicians in Rhode Island use an electronic health record. In 2013, 81% of physicians used one, and adoption varied by clinical subspecialty. Most providers think that electronic health record use improves billing and quality improvement but has not improved job satisfaction. Physicians with longer and more sophisticated electronic health record use report positive effects of introduction on all aspects of practice examined (P < .001). Older physician age is associated with worse opinion of electronic health record introduction (P < .001). Of the 18 electronic health record vendors most frequently used in Rhode Island, 5 were associated with improved job satisfaction.

- **Conclusions**: We report the largest statewide study of electronic health record adoption at the time of writing. We found increasing physician use in Rhode Island, and the extent of adoption.

### Frequency of sexual orientation and gender identity documentation after electronic medical record modification [^116bGXjs]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Documentation of sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI) is crucial for identifying lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth and conducting meaningful research to address health disparities in this community. Some electronic medical records (EMRs) have integrated SO and GI as part of the provider's workflow for documentation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this modification on the frequency of SO and GI documentation. This was a retrospective chart review of patient encounters from an outpatient pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinical practice. The rates of SO and GI documentation were compared between encounters before and after the implementation of the EMR modification. Additionally, the rates of GI and SO documentation were analyzed according to visit type and patient race.

A statistically significant increase in the frequency of SO and GI documentation after the EMR modification was detected. The SO documentation rate increased from 13.7% (10/73) to 45.1% (32/73) (P < .01), and the GI documentation rate increased from 1.4% to 46.5% (P < .01) after the EMR changes were implemented. SO or GI was most commonly documented in the social history section (90%). There were no differences in documentation based on race or type of encounter.

Including a specific tab for SO and GI in the EMR significantly increased the frequency of SO and GI documentation. Despite this increase, the frequency of documentation remained incomplete as the study concluded.

### Racial and ethnic disparity in clinical outcomes among patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in a large US electronic health record database [^114uL7Qa]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patient demographic characteristics, insurance type, and body mass index were assessed as of the index date; comorbidities and medication use were assessed during the baseline period, which began 13 months prior to the index date and ended 1 month prior to the index date. The month prior to the index date was excluded out of concern that it could reflect healthcare utilization associated with early effects of COVID-19 infection. Patient race/ethnicity (patient-reported or provider-documented) was identified from the EHR and categorized as Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black (Black), non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), non-Hispanic White (White), or Other/unknown. The Asian category includes patients identified as East Asian or Southeast Asian. The Other/unknown category includes patients with unknown race/ethnicity, those identified as Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaskan Native, and those with multiple races reported. Race/ethnicity was masked for these groups because sample sizes were too small to maintain the deidentified classification of the data source.

Study outcomes (index encounter site, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality) were assessed during the follow-up period, which began on the index date and ended on the last date of data availability (14 October 2020), with a minimum follow-up of 1 month. The index encounter site was defined as the highest level of healthcare intensity on the date of the index encounter, classified in mutually exclusive hierarchies of inpatient hospital admission, emergency department (ED) visit, or other healthcare settings.

### Consistency, completeness and external validity of ethnicity recording in NHS primary care records: A cohort study in 25 million patients' records at source using OpenSAFELY [^113MVWSN]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ethnicity is an important correlate of health outcomes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where some ethnic groups were at higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes. The recording of patients' ethnic groups in primary care supports research and efforts to achieve equity in service provision and outcomes; however, the coding of ethnicity presents complex challenges. We set out to describe ethnicity coding in detail to support the use of this data in a wide range of settings, as part of wider efforts to robustly describe and define methods of using administrative data.

- **Methods**: We describe the completeness and consistency of primary care ethnicity recording in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, containing linked primary care and hospital records in over 25 million patients in England. We also compared the ethnic breakdown in OpenSAFELY-TPP with that of the 2021 UK census.

- **Results**: 78.2% of patients registered in OpenSAFELY-TPP on 1 January 2022 had their ethnicity recorded in primary care records, rising to 92.5% when supplemented with hospital data. The completeness of ethnicity recording was higher for women than for men. The rate of primary care ethnicity recording ranged from 77% in the South East of England to 82.2% in the West Midlands. Ethnicity recording rates were higher in patients with chronic or other serious health conditions. For each of the five broad ethnicity groups, primary care recorded ethnicity was within 2.9 percentage points of the population rate as recorded in the 2021 Census.

### Are electronic health records ready for genomic medicine [^114T1VCT]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The goal of this project was to assess genetic/genomic content in electronic health records. Semistructured interviews were conducted with key informants, addressing documentation, organization, display, decision support, and security of family history and genetic test information. Challenges and opportunities in integrating genetic/genomics content in electronic health records were also explored.

There were 56 participants: 10 electronic health record specialists, 18 primary care clinicians, 16 medical geneticists, and 12 genetic counselors. Few clinicians felt their electronic records met their genetic/genomic medicine needs. Barriers to integration were mostly related to problems with family history data collection, documentation, and organization. Lack of demand for genetics content and privacy concerns were also mentioned as challenges. Data elements and functionality requirements identified by clinicians include pedigree drawing, clinical decision support for familial risk assessment and genetic testing indications, a patient portal for patient-entered data, and standards for data elements, terminology, structure, interoperability, and clinical decision support rules. Although most participants said there is little impact of genetics/genomics on electronic records today, many stated that genetics/genomics would be a driver of content in the next 5–10 years.

Electronic health records have the potential to enable the clinical integration of genetic/genomic medicine and improve the delivery of personalized health care.

### Willingness to take, use of, and indications for pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men-20 US cities, 2014 [^116CuZEU]. Clinical infectious diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention tool for people at substantial risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To monitor the state of PrEP use among men who have sex with men (MSM), we report on willingness to use PrEP and PrEP utilization. To assess whether the MSM subpopulations at highest risk for infection have indications for PrEP according to the 2014 clinical guidelines, we estimated indications for PrEP for MSM by demographics.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the 2014 cycle of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system among MSM who tested HIV negative in NHBS and were currently sexually active. Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from log-linked Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to explore differences in willingness to take PrEP, PrEP use, and indications for PrEP.

- **Results**: Whereas over half of MSM said they were willing to take PrEP, only about 4% reported using PrEP. There was no difference in willingness to take PrEP between black and white MSM. PrEP use was higher among white compared with black MSM and among those with greater education and income levels. Young, black MSM were less likely to have indications for PrEP compared with young MSM of other races/ethnicities.

- **Conclusions**: Young, black MSM, despite being at high risk of HIV acquisition, may not have indications for PrEP under the guidelines. Clinicians may need to consider other factors besides risk behaviors such as HIV incidence and prevalence in subgroups of their community.

### Content analysis of serious illness conversation documentation: Structured vs. free-text information [^114KXqSH]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Low credibility.

Clear, accessible, and thorough documentation of serious illness conversations helps ensure that critical information patients share with clinicians is reflected in their future care.

Objectives: We sought to characterize and compare serious illness conversations recorded in two different ways in the electronic health record to better understand patterns of serious illness conversation documentation.

Methods: We performed content analysis of serious illness conversations documented in the electronic health record, whether documented via a structured tab or free-text clinical notes, for patients (n = 150) with advanced cancer who started a treatment associated with a poor prognosis between October 2020 and June 2022. A multidisciplinary team iteratively developed a codebook to classify serious illness conversation content (e.g. goals/hopes) on a preliminary sample (n = 30), and two researchers performed mixed deductive-inductive coding on the remaining data (n = 120). We reviewed documentation from 34 patients with serious illness conversation documentation in the structured tab only, 43 with documentation in only free-text clinical notes, and 44 with documentation of both types. We then compared content between documentation types.

Results: Information documented more frequently in structured tabs included fears/worries and illness understanding; clinical notes more often included treatment preferences, deliberations surrounding advance directives, function, and trade-offs. Qualitative insights highlight a range of length and detail across documentation types.

### Implicit bias among physicians and its prediction of thrombolysis decisions for black and white patients [^114bg8ek]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Studies documenting racial and ethnic disparities in health care frequently implicate physicians' unconscious biases. At the time of writing, no study had measured physicians' unconscious racial bias to test whether this predicts physicians' clinical decisions.

- **Objective**: To test whether physicians show implicit race bias and whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: An internet-based tool comprising a clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute coronary syndrome was used. It was followed by a questionnaire and three Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were emailed to all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic medical centers in Atlanta and Boston. A total of 287 participants completed the study, met inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white vignette patient.

- **Main outcome measures**: IAT scores were measured as a normal continuous variable to assess physicians' implicit race preference and perceptions of cooperativeness. Physicians' attribution of symptoms to coronary artery disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race and their decisions about thrombolysis were evaluated. Assessment of physicians' explicit racial biases was conducted through a questionnaire.

- **Results**: Physicians reported no explicit preference for white versus black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast, IATs revealed an implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT score = 0.36, P < .001, one-sample t-test) and implicit stereotypes.

### Establishing a national cardiovascular disease surveillance system in the United States using electronic health record data: Key strengths and limitations [^113PJacR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The underlying concepts suggested above — geographic proximity, insurance coverage through the organization, and receipt of primary care — may be just a few of several definitions that organizations might apply to identify surveillable subsets. More generally, however, many organizations may need to identify this subset by applying some sort of EHR footprint rule to its patient population. Patients with a larger EHR footprint — more encounters, more data, and more information — should be closer to the data completeness ideal and thus more appropriate for surveillance. Unfortunately, this strategy also identifies a subset predictably biased toward a less healthy group, creating difficulties when generalizing findings to the entire country. Ultimately, any functional EHR-derived surveillance system will need to make imperfect trade-offs between data completeness and external validity.

- **Limitation #2: Data quality**: Beyond the data completeness concerns related to care (data) fragmentation and infrequent health care utilizers discussed earlier, other EHR data quality issues pose challenges for surveillance. Two distinct aspects of data quality are considered related to: (1) measurement and documentation within the clinical enterprise, and (2) their implications for operationalizing a surveillance system.

The intrinsic nature of service provision within US health care organizations creates significant interpatient variation in how much, when, and what information is collected and recorded. This reality is far from the epidemiologic ideal of standardized measurement according to a…

### Disparity of race reporting and representation in clinical trials leading to cancer drug approvals from 2008 to 2018 [^116agsDf]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The importance of representative racial/ethnic participation in research, especially in clinical trials that establish standards of care, is crucial to minimize disparities in outcomes and uphold societal equity in health care.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the frequency of race reporting and proportional race representation in trials supporting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oncology drug approvals.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This database study involved all reported trials supporting FDA oncology drug approvals granted between July 2008 and June 2018. Primary reports of trials were obtained from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. FDA approvals were identified using the FDA archives. US population-based cancer estimates by race were calculated using the National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and US Census databases.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were the proportion of trials reporting race and the proportion of patients by race participating in trials. Secondary outcomes included race subgroup analyses reporting and gaps between race proportion in trials and the US population. Descriptive statistics, Fisher exact, and χ2 tests were used to analyze the data. Proportions and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were reported.

- **Results**: Among 230 trials with a total of 112,293 participants, 145 (63.0%) reported on at least one race, 18 (7.8%) documented the four major races in the United States (white, Asian, Black, and Hispanic), and 58 (25.2%) reported race subgroup analyses. Reporting on white, Asian, black, and Hispanic races appeared in more detailed analyses.

### Use of electronic healthcare records in large-scale simple randomized trials at the point of care for the documentation of value-based medicine [^116oBuLr]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A solid foundation of evidence of the effects of an intervention is a prerequisite of evidence-based medicine. The best source of such evidence is considered to be randomized trials, which are able to avoid confounding. However, they may not always estimate effectiveness in clinical practice. Databases that collate anonymized electronic health records (EHRs) from different clinical centers have been widely used for many years in observational studies. Recently, randomized point-of-care trials have been initiated to recruit and follow patients using the data from EHR databases. In this review, we describe how EHR databases can be used for conducting large-scale simple trials and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their use.

### Randomized controlled trials of electronic health record interventions: Design, conduct, and reporting considerations [^111Nxxvi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Electronic health record (EHR) systems can be configured to deliver novel EHR interventions that influence clinical decision-making and support efficient randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and costs of those interventions.

In designing RCTs of EHR interventions, careful consideration should be given to the unit of randomization (e.g. patient, encounter, clinician, or clinical unit). It is important to balance concerns about contamination of an intervention across randomization units within clusters (e.g. patients within clinical units) against the superior control of measured and unmeasured confounders that comes with randomizing a larger number of units.

Another important consideration is whether the key computational assessment components of the EHR intervention, such as a predictive algorithm used to target a subgroup for decision support, should occur before randomization (so that only one subgroup is randomized) or after randomization (including all subgroups). When these components are applied after randomization, one must consider expected heterogeneity in the effect of the differential decision support across subgroups, which has implications for overall impact potential, analytic approach, and sample size planning.

Trials of EHR interventions should be reviewed by an institutional review board but may not require patient-level informed consent when the interventions being tested can be considered minimal risk or quality improvement, and when clinical decision-making is supported, rather than controlled, by an EHR intervention.
