## Question

finasteride dosage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about finasteride dosing across indications, including androgenetic alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hirsutism, and hidradenitis suppurativa, with attention to special populations, safety, and practical administration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and their approved doses. Then, I should verify off-label dosing ranges and the strength of evidence for hirsutism and hidradenitis suppurativa. Next, I will review pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to justify dose selection. After that, I need to check special populations, including renal and hepatic impairment, pediatrics, and pregnancy. Finally, I will examine safety signals, including sexual adverse effects, fertility, and post-finasteride syndrome, and close with practical administration pearls and a concise dosing summary.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-approved indications and labeled doses, because I need to ensure the foundation is correct before discussing off-label use. For male androgenetic alopecia, the approved dose is 1 mg orally once daily, and for benign prostatic hyperplasia, the approved dose is 5 mg orally once daily, with both regimens supported by pivotal trials and labeling that detail efficacy and safety over multi-year horizons [^9a2fef29] [^25fa9e88] [^923eb3e6] [^0b67cb45].

> Wait, let me verify the off-label indications and their dosing, since these are commonly asked about but are not FDA-approved. For hirsutism in women, guideline-supported dosing ranges from 2.5 to 7.5 mg orally daily, with 5 mg being the most commonly used dose in trials, and with the caveat that finasteride is not FDA-approved for this indication and requires reliable contraception due to teratogenic risk [^192b744b] [^4eab0109] [^9e6d7426]. For hidradenitis suppurativa in women, dosing of 1.25 to 5 mg orally daily has been described, though evidence is limited and this remains off-label, so I should emphasize the low-certainty nature of this recommendation [^a629e781] [^846e1ad7].

> I need to check the pharmacologic rationale for dose selection to ensure the dosing aligns with mechanism and clinical effect. Finasteride selectively inhibits type II 5α-reductase, rapidly suppressing serum DHT by about 65–70% with 1 mg and maintaining suppression with 5 mg, which explains why 1 mg suffices for scalp androgen signaling while 5 mg is needed for prostatic tissue where DHT drives hypertrophy and symptoms [^eb637254] [^ef552da3] [^c1caf199]. Hold on, I should verify onset and durability; clinically meaningful symptom improvement in BPH typically requires at least 6 months, and benefits are sustained with continued therapy, which supports the chronic daily dosing strategy [^3ede5a83] [^ba2f591b].

> Next, I should review special populations and dose adjustments, and I need to be careful not to overstate anything unsupported. For renal impairment, no dose adjustment is necessary because finasteride is metabolized hepatically and excreted via bile, with increased fecal excretion of metabolites when renal function is reduced, and this is reflected in both FDA labeling and pharmacokinetic summaries [^c2a2031b] [^479212d8]. For hepatic impairment, I initially thought no adjustment is needed, but wait, I should double-check; the FDA advises caution due to extensive hepatic metabolism, and although no specific dose reduction is mandated, clinical vigilance is prudent, especially in significant liver disease [^c2a2031b] [^96af3df2]. In older adults, the terminal half-life is modestly prolonged, but no routine dose adjustment is recommended, which aligns with clinical experience in BPH cohorts [^4e8c570c] [^c2a2031b]. In pediatrics, finasteride is not indicated and safety and efficacy have not been established, so it should not be used in children [^c2a2031b] [^234c3d54].

> I will now examine pregnancy and reproductive safety, because this is critical and often misunderstood. Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy due to risk of abnormal development of the external genitalia in a male fetus; women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not handle crushed or broken tablets, and men of reproductive potential should be counseled on semen exposure considerations, even though semen finasteride levels are far below pharmacologically active thresholds [^234c3d54] [^17206371] [^5ea33d6f]. Hold on, I should verify the semen data; multiple studies show semen exposure is roughly 50–100 fold below doses that affect circulating DHT, supporting the practical counseling that normal intercourse poses negligible risk, though caution remains reasonable in shared decision-making [^5ea33d6f] [^17206371].

> Let me consider safety signals, starting with sexual adverse effects, because patients frequently ask about persistence. In randomized trials for BPH, sexual adverse effects occur in a minority and often resolve with continued therapy or after discontinuation, with no clear increase over time in long-term studies, though postmarketing reports describe persistent sexual dysfunction in some men, which is reflected in FDA warnings and ongoing debate about post-finasteride syndrome [^244b54ff] [^119229b2] [^b3da8978]. I should confirm the magnitude; in a 4-year BPH study, 3.7% on finasteride vs 2.1% on placebo discontinued for sexual adverse effects, and in years 2–4 there was no significant difference, suggesting attenuation of risk with continued use in many patients [^244b54ff]. But wait, what if the patient is using 1 mg for hair loss; meta-analytic and pharmacovigilance data suggest underreporting of sexual adverse events in hair-loss trials and signal increases in younger men on 1 mg, so counseling should be balanced and individualized [^7d172da1] [^494aa094].

> I should confirm fertility considerations, especially for men pursuing conception. Finasteride can reduce ejaculate volume and, in some men, impair spermatogenesis, with case series and prospective data showing substantial recovery after discontinuation; therefore, in couples with subfertility, holding finasteride is reasonable, and recovery of semen parameters after cessation has been documented [^cbaa67d8] [^ccbda637] [^aad98af1]. Hold on, I should verify the time course; sperm counts can improve several-fold within months after stopping, though individual recovery varies, which supports a cautious approach in fertility-focused care [^cbaa67d8] [^ccbda637].

> Next, I should review prostate cancer risk, because this affects PSA interpretation and shared decision-making. Finasteride reduces overall prostate cancer incidence but increases the relative risk of high-grade disease in large prevention trials; accordingly, PSA should be baselined and interpreted using finasteride-adjusted norms, with any confirmed rise from nadir prompting evaluation even if values remain within "normal" ranges [^efb7b17b] [^ec82f68e] [^0288a632]. I need to ensure I state the practical step: establish a new PSA baseline after about 6 months and double PSA values for comparison to untreated ranges, while remembering that percent free PSA does not require adjustment [^ec82f68e].

> Let me think about administration and adherence, because these can materially affect outcomes. Finasteride can be taken with or without food, and if a dose is missed, the patient should not double up; instead, resume the next scheduled dose, which helps avoid fluctuations and supports steady-state DHT suppression [^4f3e9b34] [^31de680d]. I should confirm onset and persistence; for androgenetic alopecia, visible benefit typically emerges after 3–6 months and is lost within about 12 months after discontinuation, so counseling on persistence and expectations is essential [^31de680d].

> But wait, what about alternative dosing strategies to mitigate adverse effects or cost. Small studies suggest that intermittent low-dose regimens, such as 2.5 mg every 3 days for hirsutism, may maintain efficacy with fewer side effects, and an every-other-month 1 mg regimen for alopecia has been explored for maintenance, though these approaches are not standard of care and should be framed as investigational or individualized strategies rather than replacements for evidence-based dosing [^7ed7990d] [^16502210] [^1bd03a6f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; until larger, high-quality trials validate these schedules, daily dosing remains the reference standard for both AGA and BPH [^9a2fef29] [^923eb3e6].

> I should double-check the final dosing synthesis to ensure internal consistency and clarity. For male androgenetic alopecia, use 1 mg orally once daily, typically for at least 3–6 months to assess benefit and continued long term to maintain results. For benign prostatic hyperplasia, use 5 mg orally once daily, with counseling on slow onset and the need for sustained therapy. For female hirsutism, off-label dosing of 2.5–7.5 mg daily is supported by guidelines, with 5 mg commonly used and mandatory contraception. For hidradenitis suppurativa in women, off-label dosing of 1.25–5 mg daily has been described, though evidence is limited. Across all indications, no dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment, caution is advised in hepatic impairment, and finasteride is not indicated in pediatrics or in pregnancy [^9a2fef29] [^923eb3e6] [^192b744b] [^4eab0109] [^a629e781] [^c2a2031b] [^234c3d54].

## Special populations and dose adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is necessary [^c2a2031b] [^479212d8].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use with caution; finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver [^c2a2031b] [^96af3df2].
- **Elderly patients**: No dosage adjustment is necessary, although the elimination rate is decreased in older adults [^4e8c570c] [^c2a2031b].
- **Pediatric patients**: Not indicated for use in pediatric patients [^c2a2031b] [^234c3d54].
- **Pregnancy**: Contraindicated due to potential risk of abnormal development of the male fetus [^234c3d54] [^17206371].

---

## Clinical efficacy and safety

- **Androgenetic alopecia**: Finasteride 1 mg daily significantly increases hair count and hair weight, with sustained efficacy over long-term use [^11cc2acc] [^49ca8a2e].
- **BPH**: Finasteride 5 mg daily significantly improves urinary symptoms, increases urinary flow rate, and reduces prostate volume, with durable effects over long-term treatment [^128f08a8] [^9159259b].

This review critically examines Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS), a condition eventually reported by men who have used finasteride for androgenetic alopecia or benign prostatic enlargement and experienced persistent adverse effects after discontinuation. We explore the clinical manifestations, including sexual dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and physical changes, that collectively challenge both diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the evidence for PFS, discusses potential mechanisms including neurobiological alterations, genetic predispositions, and addresses the controversies surrounding its existence and recognition by the medical community. Emphasis is placed on the role of patient education and the need for thorough risk assessment before prescribing finasteride. Although contrasting data from literature, men treated with finasteride could develop a plethora of non-neglectable physical and psychological symptoms identifying PFS. A multidisciplinary approach to research, policy-making, and patient advocacy is essential to better understand, diagnose, and manage PFS, underlining the necessity for greater awareness and scientific inquiry into this contentious and impactful syndrome.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

 Females

Finasteride is not indicated for use in females.

 Males

Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

There have been postmarketing reports of male infertility and/or poor seminal quality; normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects included in a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1480 and 105 subjects were 65 and over and 75 and over, respectively. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Caution should be exercised in the administration of finasteride in those patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Finasteride [^4e8c570c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean terminal half-life of finasteride in subjects ≥ 70 years of age was approximately 8 hours (range, 6 to 15 hours; n = 12), compared with 6 hours (range, 4 to 12 hours; n = 12) in subjects 45 to 60 years of age. As a result, mean AUC(0 to 24 hr)after 17 days of dosing was 15% higher in subjects ≥ 70 years of age than in subjects 45 to 60 years of age (p = 0.02).

* Range

Pediatric

Finasteride pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients < 18 years of age.

Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

 Gender

Finasteride is not indicated for use in females [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and 5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

 Geriatric

No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly. Although the elimination rate of finasteride is decreased in the elderly, these findings are of no clinical significance. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5).]

### Intermittent low-dose finasteride is as effective as daily administration for the treatment of hirsute women [^7ed7990d]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

In a prospective randomized study 38 women with idiopathic hirsutism or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) received 2.5 mg of finasteride every day or every 3 days. Intermittent low-dose administration of finasteride was as effective as continuous administration in reducing hirsutism score and was accompanied by a lower incidence of side effects.

### The effectiveness of reducing the daily dose of finasteride in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^65221660]. BMC Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Finasteride, a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, is an established treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The recommended dosage is 5 mg a day, however case reports have show effectiveness with lower doses. The objective of the current study was to determine in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, previously treated for at least one year with finasteride 5 mg daily, if they will maintain subjective and objective improvements in urinary obstruction when treated with 2.5 mg of finasteride daily for one year.

Methods

In an open label, prospective study, 40 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, previously treated for at least one year with 5 mg of finasteride, took 2.5 mg of finasteride daily for one year. Measurements included AUA symptom score, maximum flow rate, voided volume and PSA.

Results

There were no significant changes in maximum flow rate, voided volume, or AUA symptom score after one year of finasteride 2.5 mg daily therapy. PSA increased significantly, p < .01, after one year of finasteride 2.5 mg daily, 2.0 +1.4 ng/ml, when compared to finasteride 5 mg daily, 1.4+ 1.0 ng/ml.

Conclusions

The daily dose of finasteride can be reduced to 2.5 mg daily without significant effect on subjective and objective measures of urinary obstruction. Although statistically significant increases in PSA are noted when reducing the daily finasteride dose from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, the clinical significance of a mean.6 ng/ml increase in PSA is questionable.

### A randomized, active-and placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of different doses of dutasteride versus placebo and finasteride in the treatment of male subjects with androgenetic alopecia [^7838b70e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dihydrotestosterone is the main androgen causative of androgenetic alopecia, a psychologically and physically harmful condition warranting medical treatment.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of dutasteride (type 1 and 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) with finasteride (type 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) and placebo in men with androgenetic alopecia.

Methods

Men aged 20 to 50 years with androgenetic alopecia were randomized to receive dutasteride (0.02, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/d), finasteride (1 mg/d), or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was hair count (2.54-cm diameter) at week 24. Other assessments included hair count (1.13-cm diameter) and width, photographic assessments (investigators and panel), change in stage, and health outcomes.

Results

In total, 917 men were randomized. Hair count and width increased dose dependently with dutasteride. Dutasteride 0.5 mg significantly increased hair count and width in a 2.54-cm diameter and improved hair growth (frontal view; panel photographic assessment) at week 24 compared with finasteride (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, and P = 0.002, respectively) and placebo (all P < .001). The number and severity of adverse events were similar among treatment groups.

Limitations

The study was limited to 24 weeks.

Conclusions

Dutasteride increased hair growth and restoration in men with androgenetic alopecia and was relatively well tolerated.

### Finasteride [^128f09a8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Monotherapy

Finasteride 5 mg/day was initially evaluated in patients with symptoms of BPH and enlarged prostates by digital rectal examination in two 1-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies and their 5-year open extensions.

Finasteride was further evaluated in a long-term efficacy and safety study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-year, multicenter study. 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78, with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH and an enlarged prostate upon digital rectal examination, were randomized into the study (1524 to finasteride, 1516 to placebo) and 3016 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 1883 patients completed the 4-year study (1000 in the finasteride group, 883 in the placebo group).

 Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using a score similar to the American Urological Association Symptom Score, which evaluated both obstructive symptoms (impairment of size and force of stream, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, delayed or interrupted urination) and irritative symptoms (nocturia, daytime frequency, need to strain or push the flow of urine) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for six symptoms and a 0 to 4 scale for one symptom, for a total possible score of 34.

### Interventions for hirsutism [^59d381dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What medical therapies are associated with greatest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating hirsutism?

Bottom Line

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been associated with improvement for mild hirsutism, as has flutamide (250 mg) twice daily and spironolactone for more severe cases. Finasteride and gonadotropin-releasing analogues are associated with inconsistent results and metformin is not associated with benefit.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In a study of 15 healthy young subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 5 mg tablets was 63% (range 34 to 108%), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. Maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27 to 49 ng/mL) and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose. Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.

 Distribution

Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44 to 96 liters). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing. After dosing with 5 mg/day of finasteride for 17 days, plasma concentrations of finasteride were 47 and 54% higher than after the first dose in men 45 to 60 years old (n = 12) and ≥ 70 years old (n = 12), respectively. Mean trough concentrations after 17 days of dosing were 6.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4 to 9.8 ng/mL) and 8.1 ng/mL (range, 1.8 to 19.7 ng/mL), respectively, in the two age groups. Although steady state was not reached in this study, mean trough plasma concentration in another study in patients with BPH (mean age, 65 years) receiving 5 mg/day was 9.4 ng/mL (range, 7.1 to 13.3 ng/mL; n = 22) after over a year of dosing.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of finasteride at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10 to 20% but remained within the physiologic range. In a separate study in healthy men treated with finasteride 1 mg per day (n = 82) or placebo (n = 69), mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.

In patients receiving finasteride 5 mg/day, increases of about 10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but levels remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected.

In patients with BPH, finasteride has no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine. No clinically meaningful effect was observed on the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.

Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α-reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH.

In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1 to 100 mg/day) for 7 to 10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of PSA was also decreased.

In healthy male volunteers treated with finasteride for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.

### Relative safety and efficacy of finasteride for treatment of hirsutism [^c1f75a7b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relative safety and efficacy of finasteride for treatment of hirsutism related to hyperandrogenism in women.

Data Sources

Literature retrieval was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-March 2003) using the terms finasteride and hirsutism. Additional information was obtained from the drug manufacturer.

Data Synthesis

Finasteride has been evaluated for treatment of hirsutism in multiple observational and randomized trials. Finasteride lowered hirsutism scores by 30–60% in most trials, as well as decreasing average hair diameter. In comparative trials, finasteride demonstrated efficacy similar to that of other antiandrogens, with fewer adverse effects.

Conclusions

Finasteride does reduce the overall hair diameter and number in androgen-sensitive areas. Reported adverse effects have been minimal. Concern over potential teratogenicity and lack of long-term safety information leave finasteride a secondary treatment option for hirsutism.

### Dutasteride [^097dde07]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy

Over 4,300 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5-mg daily doses of dutasteride in 3 identical 2-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 treatment trials, each followed by a 2-year open-label extension. During the double-blind treatment period, 2,167 male subjects were exposed to dutasteride, including 1,772 exposed for 1 year and 1,510 exposed for 2 years. When including the open-label extensions, 1,009 male subjects were exposed to dutasteride for 3 years and 812 were exposed for 4 years. The population was aged 47 to 94 years (mean age: 66 years) and greater than 90% were white. Table 1 summarizes clinical adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving dutasteride and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo.

Long-term Treatment (Up to 4 Years)

High-grade Prostate Cancer: The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of dutasteride (n = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%).

### Long-term 6-year experience with finasteride in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1946ce3d]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the 6-year clinical trial data with finasteride. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a chronic and progressive disease and therefore assessment of long-term safety and efficacy is important.

Methods

The North American and International Phase III Finasteride trials enrolled symptomatic men with enlarged prostate glands. The initial 1-year placebo-controlled study was followed by a 5-year open-label extension. In total, 6-year finasteride data were available in 487 patients originally randomized to finasteride, and 5-year data were available on 238 patients originally randomized to placebo.

Results

After 6 years of treatment with finasteride 5 mg, the mean quasi-American Urological Association Symptom Score improved by 4.0 points, the median prostate volume decreased by 24%, and the mean maximal urinary flow rate increased by 2.9 mL/s (P < 0.001 for all parameters). Long-term finasteride treatment was well tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related sexual adverse events occurring during the first year and even fewer occurrences during the 5-year open extension.

Conclusions

Treatment with finasteride leads to durable improvement in urinary tract symptoms, flow rate, and prostate volume, with no increase in the prevalence of drug-related adverse events over time.

Finasteride — symptom outcomes and counseling. Numerous robust analyses of randomized, placebo‑controlled trials have shown an improvement in standardized symptom scores superior to placebo, with improvements of 3 to 4 points observed and maintained for 6 to 10 years of follow‑up. Given the slow onset of action of this class, other medication classes may lead to more immediate relief, and patients should be counseled on a slower improvement in symptoms if men are treated with 5‑ARI alone.

### Finasteride treatment of hair loss in women [^b15230b5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available evidence on the safety and efficacy of finasteride in the treatment of alopecia in women.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted through PubMed (1948-March 2010) and MEDLINE (1950-March 2010) using the search terms finasteride and alopecia. References cited in relevant publications were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All data sources identified were reviewed for inclusion. Reports of finasteride treatment of female alopecia were included in the review. This included prospective and retrospective trials, case series, and case reports. Studies in men were not included.

Data Synthesis

Few pharmacologic options exist for women with alopecia who do not achieve satisfactory responses to topical minoxidil solution. Treatment successes with finasteride in women with female pattern hair loss, although an off-label indication, have been primarily described in uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports. In 2 controlled clinical studies, finasteride showed no benefit over placebo or no treatment in female pattern hair loss. A finasteride regimen of 1 mg orally daily, as indicated in male pattern hair loss, may be recommended for those who fail or cannot tolerate minoxidil therapy. A 12-month trial is needed to assess stabilization of hair loss, and hair regrowth may take 2 years or longer. Although data are sparse, menopausal status, circulating androgen concentrations, and concomitant symptoms of hyperandrogenism do not appear to predict response to finasteride. Overall, finasteride is well tolerated; however, women of childbearing potential must adhere to reliable contraception while receiving finasteride, and treatment is contraindicated in pregnancy, due to known teratogenicity.

Conclusions

Although objective evidence of efficacy is limited, finasteride may be considered for treatment of female pattern hair loss in patients who fail topical minoxidil treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha‑reductase inhibitors (5‑ARI) — dosing, PSA threshold, and pharmacology are as follows: providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5‑ARI response, and a minimum threshold PSA 1.5ng/mL is advised when initiating therapy; approved doses are finasteride 5 mg daily and dutasteride 0.5 mg tablet daily. Finasteride inhibits 5‑AR type II while dutasteride inhibits types I and II; serum dihydrotestosterone reduction is approximately 70% with finasteride versus approximately 95% with dutasteride, with prostate tissue reductions approximately 80% (finasteride) and approximately 94% (dutasteride). The serum half‑life of finasteride ranges from six to eight hours, whereas that of dutasteride is five weeks.

### What's new in therapy for male androgenetic alopecia? [^7158f963]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Male androgenetic alopecia is a common condition and represents a major concern for patients who experience this condition. While there are different treatments to stop hair loss and improve hair density, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have demonstrated to be effective in improving androgenetic alopecia in men and can maintain a positive response for many years. Oral finasteride 1 mg is a US FDA-approved option, but dutasteride 0.5 mg has been proven to induce better responses, especially in the frontal area. Both have been shown to be safe in clinical trials but there is widespread concern about sexual adverse effects among patients. The use of topical finasteride has increased during the last few years as a useful option to avoid systemic therapy. The efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% daily has been demonstrated in clinical trials, with a less marked decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone levels than with oral intake. Mesotherapy with dutasteride has also become more widespread recently, although evidence of its effectiveness is limited to retrospective studies in real clinical practice. The use of oral minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia has not been approved by the FDA, however several clinical studies have shown that it is an effective treatment option. The initial dose recommended to treat male hair loss is 2.5 mg daily, although the dose is frequently increased to 5 mg daily. The main adverse effect of oral minoxidil is hypertrichosis, followed by dizziness or lower limb edema, which are much less common. Platelet-rich plasma is a non-pharmacological option to treat male androgenetic alopecia, with some clinical trials demonstrating an improvement in hair count after several months. Among the published studies, the main limitation to compare its efficacy is the heterogeneity of the procedure. The most frequent regimens propose treatment every 4 weeks for 3 months initially to assess the individual response. Another treatment alternative is the use of light devices with wavelengths of between 630 and 660 nm, known as low-level laser therapy. These devices can be used at home every day for 15–30 min. Their efficacy has been shown in a limited number of clinical trials; however, there is a lack of evidence about the efficacy of these devices compared with other medical options or as a complementary therapy in hair loss. The pipeline of potential new treatments for male androgenetic alopecia is strong. Pyrilutamide and GT20029 are being studied as topical antagonists of the androgen receptor, while cetirizine is another topical option with some initial promising results. Furthermore, according to isolated studies with heterogeneous treatment schemes, the use of botulinum toxin in the scalp might improve androgenetic alopecia, and lastly, scalp threading might increase the total hair count as growth factors are released during implantation.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^0288a632]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of finasteride PO (also known as Proscar, Proscar):
- **Decreased serum PSA**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as finasteride reduces serum PSA levels even in the presence of prostate cancer. Measure baseline PSA at least 3 months after initiating finasteride and monitor periodically thereafter. Evaluate for prostate cancer in case of any increase from the lowest PSA level, even if the values are still within the normal range.
- **High-grade prostate cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving finasteride. Assess for other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms before initiating finasteride, recognizing that BPH and prostate cancer may coexist.

### Post-finasteride syndrome: a surmountable challenge for clinicians [^d885af21]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.

5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.

For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride.

Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.

The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^930101c7]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) evidence appraisal: PFS is a controversial and poorly-defined constellation of chronic 5-ARI-induced sexual, physical, and psychological symptoms that putatively persist after discontinuation of the 5-ARI. Concerns regarding PFS prompted the FDA to amend the labels for 5-ARI with a warning of its risks, and the robustness of the data justifying this change, which is based on anecdotal patient-reported outcomes rather than prospective trials, remains unclear. Dutasteride, which has activity at more 5-ARI receptors than finasteride, has largely not been implicated, and dose response association with finasteride does not seem present as the 1mg dose has been more closely linked to PFS than the more potent 5mg dose. The significant increases in reporting after the first published reports of PFS in 2012 (with no signal before 2012) points towards stimulated reporting. In general, current data on PFS draw primarily from case reports rather than prospective trials, and it is the assessment of the Panel that much of these data are susceptible to bias. Overall, the existence of persistent sexual dysfunction following cessation of 5-ARI is currently not demonstrated by reliable scientific research; there are no properly designed studies that report a significant association, and if the Bradford-Hill criteria are applied, they do not support an inference of causality with neither a strong nor consistent association reported. As for biological gradient, it is difficult to understand how 1 mg of finasteride may cause persistence when the 5 mg dose of the same drug is much less likely, and DHT levels return to normal within four weeks after cessation of finasteride use, which implies no persistent effect through a mechanism involving suppressed serum DHT levels.

### Effect of 1 mg / day finasteride on concentrations of serum prostate-specific antigen in men with androgenic alopecia: a randomised controlled trial [^80735b4e]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of 5 mg/day finasteride (Proscar) for benign prostatic hyperplasia is known to affect serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). When men taking this treatment undergo screening for prostate cancer, a compensatory adjustment of the PSA concentration (to multiply the value by two) is recommended. Whether this recommendation should apply to men taking 1 mg/day finasteride (Propecia) for the treatment of androgenic alopecia is unknown. We aimed to assess the effect of 1 mg/day finasteride on serum PSA in men aged 40–60 years with male-pattern hair loss.

Methods

Between March 13, 1998, and Jan 12, 2000, 355 men aged 40–60 years with male-pattern hair loss were stratified by age decade (40–49 years and 50–60 years), and randomised in a ratio of four to one to 1 mg/day finasteride or placebo. The primary endpoint was the effect of this treatment for 48 weeks on serum PSA concentration compared with placebo. This trial is in the process of being registered on the US National Institutes of Health website. Analyses were according to protocol.

Findings

Within 48 weeks of randomisation, men aged 40–49 years and 50–60 years who were assigned 1 mg/day finasteride had a median decrease in serum PSA concentration of 40% (95% CI 34–46) and 50% (44–57), respectively. In men assigned placebo, the median changes were 0% [-14 to 14] and a median increase of 13% [2 to 24], respectively.

Interpretation

In men aged 40–60 years, 1 mg/day finasteride for 48 weeks lowers serum PSA concentration. Therefore, the existing recommendation for the adjustment of serum PSA concentration in prostate-cancer screening in men taking 5 mg/day finasteride should also apply to men taking the 1 mg/day preparation for male-pattern hair loss. Research is needed to assess the effect of 1 mg/day finasteride preparation beyond 48 weeks of treatment.

### Adverse event reporting in clinical trials of finasteride for androgenic alopecia: a meta-analysis [^7d172da1]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Two meta-analyses conclude that finasteride treatment of androgenic alopecia (AGA) is safe but do not assess quality of safety reporting.

Objective

To assess safety reporting for clinical trial reports of finasteride for AGA.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and a clinical data repository for an academic medical center.

Study Selection

Published clinical trial reports for finasteride treatment of AGA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For each trial, we assessed quality of adverse event reporting, extracted the number and type of adverse events in treatment and placebo groups, and assessed duration of safety evaluation and adequacy of blinding. Two observers independently extracted the data; differences were resolved by consensus. We assessed generalizability in a large cohort of men prescribed finasteride, 1.25 mg/d or less, by assessing for eligibility in the finasteride-AGA pivotal trials.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Quality was assessed as adequate, partially adequate, inadequate, or no events reported. We used funnel plots of the hazard ratio to assess bias.

Results

Of 34 clinical trials, none had adequate safety reporting, 19 were partially adequate, 12 were inadequate, and 3 reported no adverse events. Funnel plots were asymmetric with a bias toward lower odds ratio for sexual adverse effects, suggesting systematic underdetection. No reports assessed adequacy of blinding, 18 (53%) disclosed conflicts of interest, and 19 (56%) received funding from the manufacturer. Duration of drug safety evaluation was 1 year or less for 26 of 34 trials (76%). Of 5704 men in the clinical data repository who were treated for AGA with finasteride, 1.25 mg/d or less, for AGA, only 31% met inclusion criteria for the pivotal trials referenced in the manufacturer's full prescribing information and 33% took finasteride for more than 1 year.

Conclusions and Relevance

Available toxicity information from clinical trials of finasteride in men with AGA is very limited, is of poor quality, and seems to be systematically biased. In a cohort of men prescribed finasteride for routine treatment of AGA, most would have been excluded from the pivotal studies that supported US Food and Drug Administration approval for AGA. Published reports of clinical trials provide insufficient information to establish the safety profile for finasteride in the treatment of AGA.

### Dutasteride: a dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia [^06cc89db]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and dosing recommendations of dutasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2006) was conducted to extract human research data in the English language on dutasteride. Search terms included benign prostatic hyperplasia, dutasteride, and finasteride. The reference lists of articles identified through this search process, the manufacturer's Web site, and dutasteride prescribing information were also examined.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All published studies and clinical data from the manufacturer were included, with emphasis placed on randomized, controlled trials.

Data Synthesis

Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate to improve urinary symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the need for BPH-related surgical interventions. Compared with placebo, dutasteride has been shown to significantly improve BPH symptoms, reduce the incidence of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery, and improve BPH-related quality of life. Few published data exist comparing dutasteride with finasteride. The most common adverse effects of dutasteride include ear, nose, and throat infection; malaise; headache; dizziness; and musculoskeletal pain.

Conclusions

Clinical trials, sponsored primarily by the manufacturer, have shown dutasteride to be an effective treatment of BPH compared with placebo and to likely possess efficacy similar to that of finasteride. Further studies are needed to gain a more clear understanding of any clinically significant differences between dutasteride and finasteride.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^119229b2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Long-Term Data

High-Grade Prostate Cancer

The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men ≥ 55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo).

No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR.

Breast Cancer

During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.

Sexual Function

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy.

### Finasteride in the treatment of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review of randomised trials [^6ce52143]. BMC Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects older men. This systematic review determined efficacy and adverse effects of finasteride.

Review Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, reference lists of reports, and reviews were searched for randomised, double-blind trials of finasteride in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Outcomes included symptom score, urinary flow rate, prostate volume, discontinuation, and adverse effects. Relative risk and NNT or NNH were calculated for dichotomous data. Sensitivity analyses assessed influences of baseline symptom severity, initial prostate volume, a dominating trial, and previous interventions.

Results

Three trials had active controls and 19 had placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, 8820 patients received finasteride 5 mg and 5909 placebo over 3–48 months. Over 48 months finasteride produced greater improvements in total symptom score, maximum urinary flow rate, and prostate volume. Significantly more sexual dysfunction, impotence, ejaculation disorder and decreased libido occurred with finasteride at 12 months; the NNH for any sexual dysfunction at 12 months was 14. Significantly fewer men treated with finasteride experienced acute retention or had surgery at 24 or 48 months than with placebo; at 12 months the NNT was 49 (31 to 112) to avoid one acute urinary retention and 31 (21 to 61) to avoid one surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed benefit with finasteride 5 mg to be constant irrespective of the initial prostate volume.

Conclusions

Information from many patients in studies of high quality showed beneficial effects of finasteride in terms of symptoms, flow rate and prostate volume. More utility would result if patient centred outcomes were reported in dichotomous form.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^558adc10]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In a study of 15 healthy young subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 5-mg tablets was 63% (range 34–108%), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. Maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27–49 ng/mL) and was reached 1–2 hours postdose. Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.

Distribution

Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44–96 liters). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing. After dosing with 5 mg/day of finasteride for 17 days, plasma concentrations of finasteride were 47 and 54% higher than after the first dose in men 45–60 years old (n = 12) and ≥ 70 years old (n = 12), respectively. Mean trough concentrations after 17 days of dosing were 6.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4–9.8 ng/mL) and 8.1 ng/mL (range, 1.8–19.7 ng/mL), respectively, in the two age groups. Although steady state was not reached in this study, mean trough plasma concentration in another study in patients with BPH (mean age, 65 years) receiving 5 mg/day was 9.4 ng/mL (range, 7.1–13.3 ng/mL; n = 22) after over a year of dosing.

### The post-finasteride syndrome: possible etiological mechanisms and symptoms [^abd490a9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride and dutasteride, synthetic 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are recommended in many guidelines for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms and alopecia despite a variety of side effects like sexual, neurological, psychiatric, endocrinological, metabolic and ophthalmological dysfunctions and the increased incidence of high grade prostate cancer. The sexual side effects are common during the use of the drug but in a small subgroup of patients, they can persist after stopping the drug. This so-called post-finasteride syndrome has serious implications for the quality of life without a clear etiology or therapy. Three types of 5α-reductases are present in many organs in- and outside the brain where they can be blocked by the two 5ARIs. There is increasing evidence that 5ARIs not only inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate and the scalp but also in many other tissues. The lipophilic 5ARIs can pass the blood-brain barrier and might block many other neurosteroids in the brain with changes in the neurochemistry and impaired neurogenesis. Further research and therapeutic innovations are urgently needed that might cure or relieve these side effects. More awareness is needed for physicians to outweigh these health risks against the benefits of 5ARIs.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^341b2fb9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — medical therapy for hirsutism highlights that no combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that antiandrogens are used empirically with important cautions. No combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hirsutism; observational or nonrandomized studies note improvement but no studies of adequate power confirm benefit, few comparative studies exist, and no one type has been shown superior; oral contraceptives may have additive benefit when combined with other modalities, most commonly spironolactone, and if a pill contains drospirenone it may be necessary to reduce the dose of spironolactone and evaluate potassium levels. None of the antiandrogen agents were developed to treat hyperandrogenism in women or are FDA-approved; a meta-analysis could only include 12 out of 348 eligible trials and found these agents are mildly effective; as a class they are teratogenic with a risk of feminization of the external genitalia in a male fetus, so they are frequently used with oral contraceptives. Spironolactone usual dosage is 25–100 mg, twice a day; a full clinical effect may take 6 months or more; approximately 20% of women will experience increased menstrual frequency; it should be used cautiously in women with renal impairment; and rarely exposure has resulted in ambiguous genitalia in male infants. Flutamide common dosage is 125–250 mg/d; the risk of teratogenicity is significant and contraception should be used; it has been combined with lifestyle and metformin therapy for PCOS and may have additive effects. Finasteride inhibits both forms of 5-α-reductase and is available as a 5-mg tablet for prostate cancer and a 1-mg tablet for male alopecia.

### Relative efficacy of minoxidil and the 5-α reductase inhibitors in androgenetic alopecia treatment of male patients: a network meta-analysis [^2b59cb26]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There are knowledge gaps regarding the relative efficacy of 3 commonly used drugs for androgenetic alopecia (AGA), namely, minoxidil and the two 5-α reductase inhibitors dutasteride and finasteride.

Objective

To examine the relative efficacy of any dose and administration route of minoxidil, dutasteride, and finasteride for the treatment of male AGA.

Data Sources

Systematic searches were performed in PubMed on March 5, 2021, without date restrictions.

Study Selection

Eligible studies included those that investigated monotherapy with any dose and administration route of minoxidil, dutasteride, and finasteride.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data on the mean (SD) difference and sample size were used for the bayesian network meta-analyses. League tables and surface under the cumulative ranking curve values were used to examine the relative efficacy of the interventions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Study end points were change in total and terminal hair count after 24 and 48 weeks of therapy. The 4 end points were quantified in hairs per square centimeters.

Results

The PubMed search yielded 848 records; after the 2 stages of screening, 23 studies were eligible for quantitative analyses. Mean (SD) age of patients ranged from 22.8(3.3) years to 41.8(12.3) years. The greatest increase in total hair count at 24 weeks (ie, first end point) was with 0.5 mg/d of dutasteride, which was significantly more efficacious than 1 mg/d of finasteride (mean difference, 7.1 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 5.1–9.3 hairs/cm2) and minoxidil (0.25 mg/d [mean difference, 23.7 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 9.5–38.0 hairs/cm2], 5 mg/d [mean difference, 15.0 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 3.9–26.1 hairs/cm2], and 2% solution [mean difference, 8.5 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 4.8–12.3 hairs/cm2]). The greatest increase in terminal hair count at 24 weeks (ie, second end point) was with 5 mg/d of minoxidil, which was significantly more efficacious than the 0.25-mg/d dose (mean difference, 43.6 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 29.7–57.7 hairs/cm2) and its topical forms (in 2% [mean difference, 29.3 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 21.1–37.5 hairs/cm2] and 5% [mean difference, 29.8 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 19.7–39.8 hairs/cm2]); 5 mg/d of minoxidil was significantly more efficacious than 1 mg/d of finasteride (mean difference, 10.4 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 2.2–18.6 hairs/cm2). The greatest increase in total hair count at 48 weeks (ie, third end point) was with 5 mg/d of finasteride, which was significantly more efficacious than 2% topical minoxidil (mean difference, 20.7 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 9.5–31.9 hairs/cm2). The greatest increase in terminal hair count at 48 weeks (ie, fourth end point) was with 1 mg/d of finasteride, which was significantly more effective than topical minoxidil (in 2% [mean difference, 32.1 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 23.9–40.3 hairs/cm2] and 5% [mean difference, 26.2 hairs/cm2; 95% CI, 16.2–36.2 hairs/cm2]).

Conclusions and Relevance

As efficacy data from head-to-head trials accumulate, there could be a better sense of the relative efficacy of the different doses of the 5-α reductase inhibitors and minoxidil. The findings of this meta-analysis contribute to the comparative effectiveness literature for AGA therapies with regard to the compared interventions.

### Does variation in either age at start of therapy or duration of therapy make chemoprevention with finasteride cost-effective? [^b15f7cb4]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of finasteride for prostate cancer prevention are consistent with estimates beyond $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The majority of these analyses are based on chemoprevention starting in men aged 50–55 years. We sought to evaluate the impact of varying both age at commencement of therapy and length of therapy on the cost-effectiveness of finasteride.

Methods

A probabilistic Markov model was designed to estimate lifetime prostate health-related costs and quality-adjusted survival for men receiving or not receiving chemoprevention with finasteride. ICERs across scenarios varying age at start of therapy and duration of chemoprevention were compared.

Results

The ICER for men starting chemoprevention at age 50 and continuing to age 75 was $88800 per QALY when assuming finasteride causes a constant risk reduction across all tumor grades (base case 1) and $142300 per QALY when assuming a differential treatment effect according to Gleason score (base case 2). When starting age is increased, the ICERs trend downward and nadir at 65 years to $64700 per QALY (base case 1) and $118600 per QALY (base case 2). Altering duration of therapy had minimal impact. Patient-level experiences with finasteride and BPH significantly influenced the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention.

Conclusions

Initiating chemoprevention at ages when prostate cancer incidence is higher improves its cost-effectiveness profile. Only when assuming a constant risk reduction for all tumor grades, did finasteride fall below $100000 per QALY, but this finding was not upheld when accounting for side effects associated with the drug.

### Finasteride use in the male infertility population: effects on semen and hormone parameters [^cbaa67d8]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the degree of improvement in semen parameters after finasteride discontinuation.

Design

A prospective database of men presenting for a fertility evaluation was analyzed for semen and hormone parameters before and after discontinuation of finasteride.

Setting

A male infertility specialty clinic.

Patient(S)

Men presenting for fertility evaluation from 2008–2012 on finasteride.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen and hormone parameters before and after discontinuation of finasteride.

Result(S)

At presentation, 27 (0.6%) of 4,400 men on finasteride. The mean duration of treatment with finasteride was 57.4 months, and mean dose was 1.04 mg/day. There was an average 11.6-fold increase in sperm counts after finasteride discontinuation. Of the men with severe oligospermia (< 5 M/mL), 57% had counts increase to > 15 M/mL after finasteride cessation. No man had a decrease in sperm count. There was no change in hormone parameters, sperm motility, or sperm morphology.

Conclusion(S)

Finasteride, even at low doses, may cause reduced sperm counts in some men. In this population, counts improved dramatically for the majority of men after finasteride discontinuation. The hormone parameters, sperm motility, and sperm morphology were unchanged after cessation. Finasteride should be discontinued in subfertile men with oligospermia, and used with caution in men who desire fertility.

### A population-based nested case-control study: the use of 5-α-reductase inhibitors and the increased risk of osteoporosis diagnosis in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia [^70a93e08]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are the potent androgen responsible for the development and enlargement of the prostate gland by decreasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This results in inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and markedly suppresses serum dihydrotestosterone levels. Testosterone replacement therapy improves bone density in men with hypogonadal osteoporosis. This study explores the possible association between the use of two typical 5ARIs (finasteride and dutasteride) and the subsequent risk of osteoporosis diagnosis.

Methods

We identified 1352 osteoporosis diagnosis cases and 5387 control cases without osteoporosis diagnosis from the claims data for patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), which are collected in the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Four controls were frequency matched to each case according to age (every 5 years) and diagnosis date. We measured the effect of 5ARIs and determined the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We observed a 1.52-fold increase in osteoporosis diagnosis among patients with BPH using finasteride (95% CI, 1.01–2.30). Furthermore, a dosage analysis showed that higher doses of finasteride were associated with higher osteoporosis diagnosis risk (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01–2.81), relative to the patients not using 5ARIs.

Conclusion

This population-based nested case-control study suggests that the use of finasteride can increase the risk of osteoporosis diagnosis among patients with BPH. The effects were more prominent in patients using higher doses of finasteride.

### The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer [^efb7b17b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study PCPT was published by Thompson IM and colleagues in 2003 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the PCPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer? In the PCPT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PCPT study, the population was: 18882 male patients. The inclusion criteria were men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL. The key exclusion criteria were PSA level > 3.0 ng/mL, previous prostate cancer, early termination of the study, or declined biopsy. In the PCPT study, the interventions were: n = 9423 finasteride (5 mg/day for 7 years) n = 9459 placebo (matching placebo for 7 years). In the PCPT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period (18.4% vs. 24.4%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). In the PCPT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in tumors of Gleason grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 (6.4% vs. 5.1%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.5). In the PCPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in number of deaths (5 vs. 5). significant difference in sexual side-effects more common in finasteride group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons) and urinary symptoms more common in placebo group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In the PCPT study, the conclusion was: in men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL, finasteride was superior to placebo with respect to the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period.

### Controversies in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia: the history of finasteride [^9032028d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects up to 60% of men by the age of 50. Currently, there are only two approved drugs for the treatment of male AGA: topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. Topical minoxidil is readily available over the counter and has a well-established safety record. However, following 24weeks of treatment, less than 40% of men respond to the drug. Additionally, due to the topical route of administration, compliance with minoxidil remains low. In contrast, oral finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in arresting hair loss in more than 80% of patients following 12months of treatment. However, controversy surrounding potential adverse sexual side effects has negatively affected public perception of the drug and may significantly reduce the number of patients that can benefit from the drug.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Studies for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss

In three controlled clinical trials for PROPECIA of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking PROPECIA (n = 945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n = 934).

Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in ≥ 1% of patients treated with PROPECIA or placebo are presented in Table 1.

Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p = 0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to ≤ 0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA.

In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment.

In the clinical studies with PROPECIA, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo.

### Bioequivalence of a single 10-mg dose of finasteride 5-mg oral disintegrating tablets and standard tablets in healthy adult male han Chinese volunteers: a randomized sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study [^a4cf1b5a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Finasteride, an inhibitor of the steroid 5alpha-reductase, has been approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenetic alopecia. An orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) 5-mg formulation of finasteride was recently developed. Information regarding its pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence was required to assess the efficacy and safety of this formulation before marketing it in China.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare the bioavailability of finasteride ODTs and standard tablets in healthy adult male Han Chinese volunteers and to determine whether any observed differences exceeded Chinese regulatory guidelines for bioequivalence.

Methods

This single-dose, randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover trial was conducted in China. Healthy adult male Han Chinese volunteers were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of either the ODT or standard tablet formulation, followed by a 1-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. Doses were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For analysis of pharmacokinetic properties, including C(max), AUC(0–24), and AUC(0-infinity), blood samples were obtained at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 24 hours after administration. The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if calculations of the 90% CI for the ratio of the means of the measures for the test and reference formulations fell within bioequivalence limits, 80% to 125%, for logarithmic (log) transformation of C(max) and AUC, and if Schuirmann's two 1-sided tests showed P < 0.05. Tolerability was assessed using vital sign measurements (ie, blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate), laboratory analysis (ie, hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis), and interviews with participants.

Results

Twenty-four men (mean [SD] age, 22.0 [1.2] years [range, 20–24 years]; weight, 63.5 [4.6] kg [range, 55–70 kg]; height, 172.8 [4.4] cm [range, 164–180 cm]) were enrolled in this study, and 24 (12 each randomized to receive the ODT or standard tablet first) completed it. No period or sequence effects were observed. The 90% CIs for the log-transformed C(max), AUC(0–24), and AUC(0-infinity) values were 86.8 to 106.8, 95.1 to 119.1, and 96.2 to 117.5, respectively (all, P < 0.05). The Wilcoxon rank sum test of T(max) found a significant difference between the ODT formulation (mean [SD], 2.40 [0.47] hours) and standard tablet formulation (1.98 [0.63] hours). No adverse events were reported by the volunteers or found in clinical laboratory testing during the study.

Conclusions

In this single-dose study, based on the rate and extent of absorption, the ODT (ie, test) and standard tablet (ie, reference) formulations of finasteride met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence in these fasting healthy adult male Han Chinese volunteers. However, a significant difference was found for T(max) between the test and reference formulations. Both formulations were well tolerated. ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: 2005L02216.

### Changes in hair weight and hair count in men with androgenetic alopecia after treatment with finasteride, 1 mg, daily [^11cc2acc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Finasteride, a type II 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, reduces scalp and serum dihydrotestosterone and has been shown to be effective in men with androgenetic alopecia (AGA).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of finasteride on scalp hair weight in men with AGA.

Methods

Sixty-six men with AGA received finasteride, 1 mg/d, or placebo in a 48-week study, and 49 men continued in a 48-week extension. Efficacy was assessed by scalp hair weights and hair counts.

Results

As expected, hair counts improved with finasteride (net mean percent change ± SE [95% CI] compared with placebo = 9.2% ± 2.8% [3.8, 14.6] and 15.4% ± 3.2% [9.1, 21.7] at 48 and 96 weeks, respectively; P < .01 for both time points), and net improvements in hair weight were greater (25.6% ± 3.6% [18.5, 32.7] and 35.8% ± 4.6% [26.7, 44.8] at 48 and 96 weeks, respectively; P < .001 for both time points). Finasteride was generally well tolerated.

Conclusion

In this study, finasteride, 1 mg, increased hair weight in men with AGA. Hair weight increased to a larger extent than hair count, implying that factors other than the number of hairs, such as increased growth rate (length) and thickness of hairs, contribute to the beneficial effects of finasteride in treated men.

### Long-term treatment with finasteride in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: 10-year follow-up [^d004e72e]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of finasteride 5 mg during a 10-year period in men with enlarged prostates from a single center who participated in the double-blind and extension phases of the multicenter, Phase III, North American benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) trial. It is important that the long-term safety and efficacy of drugs intended for chronic administration in men with BPH be well understood.

Methods

The Phase III North American BPH trial involved a 1-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, followed by a 5-year open extension with finasteride 5 mg/day. The trial enrolled men with symptomatic BPH, an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination, and no evidence of prostate cancer. Of the 46 patients originally enrolled from our institution, 43 were randomized to receive finasteride or placebo, of whom 41 (95%) completed the double-blind study and entered the 5-year extension. Thirty (73%) of these 41 patients completed the 5-year extension. Patients continued to be followed up by their physicians for an additional 5 years, for a total follow-up of at least 10 years.

Results

Twenty-four (56%) of the original 43 patients randomized to finasteride or placebo were judged as successfully treated during the 10-year finasteride follow-up (17 patients taking finasteride alone at 10 years and 7 patients who were taking finasteride alone when they discontinued during the 10-year follow-up for reasons not related to finasteride treatment). Altogether, 22 (51%) of the original 43 randomized patients continued finasteride treatment at 10 years (17 taking finasteride alone, 4 taking finasteride plus an alpha-blocker, and 1 taking finasteride for treatment of hematuria). Finasteride was well tolerated, with no new adverse experiences occurring with increasing duration of exposure to the drug.

Conclusions

This long-term follow-up study has demonstrated that appropriately selected patients with symptomatic BPH and enlarged prostates are likely to have a long-term response to taking finasteride 5 mg daily.

Finasteride

Finasteride is a 5-α-reductase inhibitor that inhibits the type 2 isoform, specifically leading to a reduction in the production of dihydrotestosterone, thereby leading to a decrease in hirsutism. Primarily used in men for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic cancer, a large cohort population concluded that there was no adverse cardiovascular risk in men. This is likely to also be the case in women, but there are no data to confirm this.

*First-dose values; all other parameters are last-dose values

 Race

The effect of race on finasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied.

 Hepatic Impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on finasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Caution should be exercised in the administration of finasteride in those patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver.

 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. In patients with chronic renal impairment, with creatinine clearances ranging from 9.0 to 55 mL/min, AUC, maximum plasma concentration, half-life, and protein binding after a single dose of14C-finasteride were similar to values obtained in healthy volunteers. Urinary excretion of metabolites was decreased in patients with renal impairment. This decrease was associated with an increase in fecal excretion of metabolites. Plasma concentrations of metabolites were significantly higher in patients with renal impairment (based on a 60% increase in total radioactivity AUC). However, finasteride has been well tolerated in BPH patients with normal renal function receiving up to 80 mg/day for 12 weeks, where exposure of these patients to metabolites would presumably be much greater.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — finasteride outcomes and recommendation: (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The Proscar Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled U.S. trial, randomized more than 3,000 men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE) to finasteride 5 mg/day or placebo; over the 4-year study period, 10% of the 1,516 men on placebo underwent surgery for BPH versus 5% of the 1,524 men on finasteride (a 55% reduction), and acute urinary retention (AUR) developed in approximately 7% versus approximately 3% (a 57% reduction). Finasteride produced a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with a 3.3-fold reduction versus a 1.3 reduction on placebo, improved urinary flow rates, and significantly (p < 0.001) reduced prostate volume; the study suggests that long-term medical therapy could impact the natural history of BPH as manifested by AUR and surgery.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^256d2136]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 June 2003). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. All included trials were small (no more than 41 participants) randomised and controlled. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Two trials investigated spironolactone versus placebo; one trial was a dosage studies of spironolactone; one trial compared spironolactone with spironolactone in combination with dexamethasone; one trial used topical spironolactone for the treatment of acne, one trial compared three treatments; spironolactone, finasteride, cyproterone acetate. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

All sample populations were small and confidence intervals were wide. In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in Ferriman-Galwey scores 12 months after the end of treatment in those women who received 100mg/day spironolactone compared to 12.5 mg/day cyproterone acetate (first 10 days of cycle) (WMD -1.18, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.26) and 5mg/day finasteride (WMD -2.34, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.45).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Six months treatment with 100 mg/day spironolactone compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant subjective improvement in hair growth and a decrease in Ferriman-Galwey scores. Spironolactone 100mg/day is superior to finasteride 5 mg/day and low dose cyproterone acetate 12.5 mg/day (first 10 days of cycle) up to 12 months after the end of treatment. The effectiveness of treatment for acne vulgaris cannot be determined due to the small sample populations involved in the trials. Its value in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research.

### Finasteride [^17206371]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride is a Type II 5α-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus.

Abnormal male genital development is an expected consequence when conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is inhibited by 5α-reductase inhibitors. These outcomes are similar to those reported in male infants with genetic 5α-reductase deficiency. Females could be exposed to finasteride through contact with crushed or broken finasteride tablets or semen from a male partner taking finasteride. With regard to finasteride exposure through the skin, finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent skin contact with finasteride during normal handling if the tablets have not been crushed or broken. Females who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets because of possible exposure of a male fetus. With regard to potential finasteride exposure through semen, three studies have been conducted that measured finasteride concentrations in semen in men receiving finasteride 5 mg/day. In these studies the highest amount of finasteride in semen was estimated to be 50- to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 mcg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A review of the FAERS data on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: implications for postfinasteride syndrome [^494aa094]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify reports made to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), create a demographic of patient reports, and examine the cluster of symptoms to correlate consistency of postfinasteride syndrome (PFS) complaints. PFS is a provisional diagnosis encompassing a cluster of sexual, physical, and psychological and/or neurologic symptoms associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use that emerge or continue after discontinuation of medication.

Materials and Methods

FAERS dataset of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from April 2011 to October 2014 was obtained. Each FAERS report had 16 categories for completion, but not every report was fully completed. Statistical analysis compared variables of interest between the 2 doses of finasteride (1 mg vs 5 mg).

Results

From FAERS, 2048 monotherapy cases were identified: 1581 of finasteride 1 mg, 240 of finasteride 5 mg, and 226 of unreported doses. Possibly related to labeling changes, from 2011 to 2014, there was a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) reported involving 1 mg dosing. Finasteride use was reported with many sexual AEs including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory complaints. Other common AEs included dermatologic, metabolic, and psychological and/or neurologic complaints. There were more AE reports with the 1 mg dose than the 5 mg dose. One case of dutasteride reported back pain, not generally attributed to PFS.

Conclusion

FAERS data suggests that finasteride exposure is reported with a diverse collection of symptoms, particularly in younger men on 1 mg dosage compared to older men on 5 mg. Many of these complaints fall well out of the realm of previously established AEs from long-term controlled studies.

### Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7a312167]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms (intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library (which includes CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Heath Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and which includes EMBASE and MEDLINE), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) and Google Scholar for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated, urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of ≤ 1 year (short term) and > 1 year (long term).

Main Results

Finasteride consistently improved urinary symptom scores more than placebo in trials of > 1 year duration, and significantly lowered the risk of BPH progression (acute urinary retention, risk of surgical intervention, ≥ 4 point increase in the AUASI/IPSS). In comparison to alpha-blocker monotherapy, finasteride was less effective than either doxazosin or terazosin, but equally effective compared to tamsulosin. Both doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more likely than finasteride to improve peak urine flow and nocturia, versus finasteride. Versus tamsulosin, peak urine flow and QoL improved equally well versus finasteride. However, finasteride was associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention compared to doxazosin, but not to terazosin, while finasteride and doxazosin were no different for risk of acute urinary retention. Two small trials reported no difference in urinary symptom scores between finasteride and tamsulosin. Finasteride + doxazosin and doxazosin monotherapy improved urinary symptoms equally well (≥ 4 point improvement). For finasteride, there was an increased risk of ejaculation disorder, impotence, and lowered libido, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, finasteride had a lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension, and versus terazosin, finasteride had a significant, lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension.

Authors' Conclusions

Finasteride improves long-term urinary symptoms versus placebo, but is less effective than doxazosin. Long-term combination therapy with alpha blockers (doxazosin, terazosin) improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy. Finasteride + doxazosin improves symptoms equally - and clinically - to doxazosin alone. In comparison to doxazosin, finasteride + doxazosin appears to improve urinary symptoms only in men with medium (25 to < 40 mL) or large prostates (≥ 40 mL), but not in men with small prostates (25 mL). Comparing short to long-term therapy, finasteride does not improve symptoms significantly better than placebo at the short term, but in the long term it does, although the magnitude of differences was very small (from < 1.0 point to 2.2 points). Doxazosin improves symptoms better than finasteride both short and long term, with the magnitude of differences ∼2.0 points and 1.0 point, respectively. Finasteride + doxazosin improves scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term, with mean differences ∼2.0 points for both time points. Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin improves scores equally for short and long term. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, which has higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder. Finasteride significantly reduces asthenia, postural hypotension, and dizziness versus terazosin. Finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride + terazosin.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^c1caf199]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of PROSCAR produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of PROSCAR at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10–20% but remained within the physiologic range. In a separate study in healthy men treated with finasteride 1 mg per day (n = 82) or placebo (n = 69), mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.

In patients receiving PROSCAR 5 mg/day, increases of about 10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but levels remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with PROSCAR did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected.

In patients with BPH, PROSCAR has no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine. No clinically meaningful effect was observed on the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.

Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α-reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH.

In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1–100 mg/day) for 7–10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of PSA was also decreased.

In healthy male volunteers treated with PROSCAR for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.

### Finasteride and fertility: case report and review of the literature [^aad98af1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although millions of men have taken or are taking finasteride, there are no documented cases of successful pregnancy in the literature after discontinuation of the drug. Early studies did not show significant influence of finasteride on semen parameters, whereas some recent observations have suggested that in subfertile patients, the effects of the drug might be amplified. Therefore, counseling is particularly difficult for men taking finasteride and planning pregnancy. We report the case of a couple whose male partner had used finasteride for approximately 10 years and who presented for primary infertility. The first semen analysis, carried out 3 months after finasteride cessation, revealed severe oligospermia. One month later, sperm concentration increased, and the following month, the couple spontaneously conceived. A healthy baby was delivered at full term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful full-term pregnancy and live birth after long-term use of finasteride, which suggests that treatment with finasteride, even after several years, does not prevent normal conception. However, caution should be advised with the use of finasteride in male partners of couples who are attempting to become pregnant.

14.2 Combination with Alpha-Blocker Therapy

The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 4- to 6-year study (average 5 years) in 3047 men with symptomatic BPH, who were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n = 768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 786), or placebo (n = 737). All participants underwent weekly titration of doxazosin (or its placebo) from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg/day. Only those who tolerated the 4 or 8 mg dose level were kept on doxazosin (or its placebo) in the study. The participant's final tolerated dose (either 4 mg or 8 mg) was administered beginning at end-Week 4. The final doxazosin dose was administered once per day, at bedtime.

The mean patient age at randomization was 62.6 years (± 7.3 years). Patients were Caucasian (82%), African American (9%), Hispanic (7%), Asian (1%) or Native American (< 1%). The mean duration of BPH symptoms was 4.7 years (± 4.6 years). Patients had moderate to severe BPH symptoms at baseline with a mean AUA symptom score of approximately 17 out of 35 points. Mean maximum urinary flow rate was 10.5 mL/sec (± 2.6 mL/sec). The mean prostate volume as measured by transrectal ultrasound was 36.3 mL (± 20.1 mL). Prostate volume was ≤ 20 mL in 16% of patients, ≥ 50 mL in 18% of patients and between 21 and 49 mL in 66% of patients.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Finasteride:

In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of finasteride at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%.

The page states data are very sparse, that benefit is unclear when testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are already lowered, "we therefore do not recommend their routine use in trans feminine populations", that "Finasteride may be an appropriate treatment option" for bothersome alopecia, and that treatment "may impair clitoral growth and the development of facial and body hair".

### Finasteride [^93cc6ac5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.

Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t½∼ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Do not split CIALIS tablets; entire dose should be taken.

2.1 CIALIS for Use as Needed for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of CIALIS for use as needed in most patients is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity.
The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients.
CIALIS for use as needed was shown to improve erectile function compared to placebo up to 36 hours following dosing. Therefore, when advising patients on optimal use of CIALIS, this should be taken into consideration.

2.2 CIALIS for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 2.5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.
The CIALIS dose for once daily use may be increased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability.

2.3 CIALIS for Once Daily Use for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day.
When therapy for BPH is initiated with CIALIS and finasteride, the recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day for up to 26 weeks.

2.4 CIALIS for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of CIALIS for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.

2.5 Use with Food

CIALIS may be taken without regard to food.

### Finasteride, 1 mg daily administration on male androgenetic alopecia in different age groups: 10-year follow-up [^281ff816]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Finasteride 1 mg is indicated for the treatment of men with androgenetic alopecia (AGA). However, more than 5 years efficacy and safety has not been previously reported. To assess the efficacy over 10 years in different age groups of men with AGA. 118 men, between 20 and 61 years, with AGA receiving finasteride (1 mg/day), were enrolled in this uncontrolled study. Efficacy evaluation was assessed with standardized global photographs at T0, T1, T2, T5, T10. Statistical analysis was made using frequency tables and evaluating the chi-square index with its p-value. Better improvements are observed in patients older than 30 years (42.8% aged between 20 and 30 years did not improve also after 10 years) or with higher AGA grades (58.9% for AGA grade IV and 45.4% for AGA grade V had the first improvement just after 1 year). In 21% of cases, the treatment continuation beyond 5 years provided better results. Side effects were referred by 6% of the patients; nevertheless, some of them went on with treatment because of the great results. In our opinion, the result after the first year can help in predicting the effectiveness of the treatment. Its efficacy was not reduced as time goes on; in fact, a big proportion of subjects unchanged after 1 year, improved later on, maintaining a positive trend.

5.3 Exposure of Women-Risk to Male Fetus

Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnant females and in females who may potentially be pregnant and not indicated for use in females. Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, finasteride may cause abnormal development of external genitalia in a male fetus if administered to a pregnant female. Females who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets. finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. If a pregnant female comes in contact with crushed or broken finasteride tablets, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 and 12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16).]

5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women

Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or females [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics

Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks.

5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions

Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist.

Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy.

### Finasteride-associated male infertility [^ccbda637]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a male patient with finasteride-associated infertility.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Tertiary-care clinic for male infertility.

Patient(S)

A patient with azoospermia who had been taking finasteride (1-mg dose) for 1 year for androgenic alopecia. He had been diagnosed with oligospermia 5 years before.

Intervention(S)

Discontinuation of finasteride.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Improvement of semen parameters.

Result(S)

After cessation of finasteride, the patient's semen volume increased immediately, and sperm concentration was up to more than 10 × 10⁶/mL 16 weeks after stopping finasteride. He is now trying to achieve pregnancy by intrauterine insemination.

Conclusion(S)

Cessation of finasteride improved spermatogenesis and allowed the couple to attempt less-invasive fertility therapy. In this case, the patient had impaired spermatogenesis before he started the drug. In such patients, the drug may further decrease spermatogenesis. We suggest that drug cessation could be taken into consideration for infertile male patients with impaired semen parameters who are taking finasteride at a 1-mg dose.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study)

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions.

Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was ≥ 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

### Finasteride (Propecia) [^eb637254]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, reaching 65% suppression within 24 hours of oral dosing with a 1-mg tablet. Mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.

Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor and has no androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or progestational effects. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanisms(s) by which PROPECIA exerts its clinical effect is unknown. In studies with finasteride, no clinically meaningful changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or prolactin were detected. In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected. Finasteride had no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine, nor did it affect the plasma lipid profile (e.g., total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.

In a study in 15 healthy young male subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 1-mg tablets was 65% (range 26–170%), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. At steady state following dosing with 1 mg/day (n = 12), maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 9.2 ng/mL (range, 4.9–13.7 ng/mL) and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose; AUC(0–24 hr)was 53 ng∙hr/mL (range, 20–154 ng∙hr/mL). Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

- hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face)

- testicular pain

- hematospermia

- sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown.

- male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown.

- depression

- male breast cancer.

The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

- orgasm disorders

Data

 Human Data

In 2 studies of healthy subjects (n = 69) receiving finasteride 5 mg/day for 6–24 weeks, finasteride concentrations in semen ranged from undetectable (< 0.1 ng/mL) to 10.54 ng/mL. In an earlier study using a less sensitive assay, finasteride concentrations in semen of 16 subjects receiving finasteride 5 mg/day ranged from undetectable (< 1.0 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Using the highest semen level measured and assuming 100% absorption would be up to 105 ng per day, which is 50- to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 mcg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Animal Data

In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). At maternal doses of oral finasteride approximately 0.1 to 86 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day (based on AUC at animal doses of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day) there was a dose-dependent increase in hypospadias that occurred in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring. Exposure multiples were estimated using data from nonpregnant rats. Days 16 to 17 of gestation is a critical period in male fetal rats for differentiation of the external genitalia. At oral maternal doses approximately 0.03 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day), male offspring had decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development. Decreased anogenital distance occurred in male offspring of pregnant rats that received approximately 0.003 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.003 mg/kg/day). No abnormalities were observed in female offspring at any maternal dose of finasteride.

### Finasteride [^3ede5a83]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients in a long-term efficacy and safety study had moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (mean of approximately 15 points on a 0 to 34 point scale). Patients randomized to finasteride who remained on therapy for 4 years had a mean (± 1 SD) decrease in symptom score of 3.3 (± 5.8) points compared with 1.3 (± 5.6) points in the placebo group. (See Figure 1.) A statistically significant improvement in symptom score was evident at 1 year in patients treated with finasteride vs placebo (–2.3 vs –1.6), and this improvement continued through Year 4.

 Figure 1

 Symptom Score in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Although an early improvement in urinary symptoms was seen in some patients, a therapeutic trial of at least 6 months was generally necessary to assess whether a beneficial response in symptom relief had been achieved. The improvement in BPH symptoms was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.

 Effect on Acute Urinary Retention and the Need for Surgery

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, efficacy was also assessed by evaluating treatment failures. Treatment failure was prospectively defined as BPH-related urological events or clinical deterioration, lack of improvement and/or the need for alternative therapy. BPH-related urological events were defined as urological surgical intervention and acute urinary retention requiring catheterization. Complete event information was available for 92% of the patients. The following table (Table 5) summarizes the results.

### Finasteride [^91b9bbe1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier but does not appear to distribute preferentially to the CSF.

In 2 studies of healthy subjects (n = 69) receiving finasteride 5 mg/day for 6 to 24 weeks, finasteride concentrations in semen ranged from undetectable (< 0.1 ng/mL) to 10.54 ng/mL. In an earlier study using a less sensitive assay, finasteride concentrations in the semen of 16 subjects receiving finasteride 5 mg/day ranged from undetectable (< 1.0 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Thus, based on a 5 mL ejaculate volume, the amount of finasteride in semen was estimated to be 50- to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 mcg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men [see also Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

 Metabolism

Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme subfamily. Two metabolites, the t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites, have been identified that possess no more than 20% of the 5α-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride.

 Excretion

In healthy young subjects (n = 15), mean plasma clearance of finasteride was 165 mL/min (range, 70 to 279 mL/min) and mean elimination half-life in plasma was 6 hours (range, 3 to 16 hours). Following an oral dose of14C-finasteride in man (n = 6), a mean of 39% (range, 32 to 46%) of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites; 57% (range, 51 to 64%) was excreted in the feces.

### Therapeutic maintenance effect of finasteride 1 mg every other month regimen in androgenetic alopecia and study on the difference in response to finasteride treatment: a prospective cohort study [^1bd03a6f]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Finasteride is commonly used for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic maintenance effect of a finasteride every other month (EOM) regimen and analyze clinical and laboratory differences in patients with AGA according to their treatment response. One hundred males with AGA who received finasteride 1mg daily treatment for a year were enrolled in the study. At 1year follow-up, treatment responses of patients who completed the visit schedule were assessed using five scales. The patients were assigned to good or bad response groups according to their assessment. Further, they were randomly divided into two groups (daily vs. EOM) and treated with finasteride (1mg) for 1 more year. At 2years follow-up, treatment efficacy was assessed. At 1-year follow-up, 36 patients completed the schedule, including eight and three patients in the good and bad response groups, respectively. At the 2-year follow-up, 23 patients completed the schedule, with nine in the daily group and 14 in the EOM group. Changes in global photographic assessment in the second year were 1.33 and 1.29 for the daily and EOM groups, respectively. The daily group showed an elevated hair density and lower concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the DHT to testosterone ratio (DHT/T). However, the EOM group showed decreased hair density and elevated DHT and DHT/T. Following treatment response assessment after 1year of treatment, the good response group showed early onset which was associated with maternal AGA. Analysis of serum androgen hormone magnitude of DHT reduction was much greater (54.4% vs. 44.4%). DHT/T was higher in the bad response group (1.98 vs. 2.33). We concluded that the finasteride EOM regimen showed similar maintenance effects to the daily regimen.

### Management of hirsutism [^bd4a9166]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

This review reports our own experience with, and literature studies of, the pharmacological management of hirsutism in women with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome) or with normal serum androgen levels and regular ovulatory menstrual cycles (idiopathic hirsutism). Treatment consists of suppressing ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion, or blocking androgen actions in the skin. The major drugs used are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and steroidal (cyproterone acetate and spironolactone) or nonsteroidal (flutamide and finasteride) antiandrogens. GnRH agonists, suppressing the pituitary, decrease androgen and estradiol secretion and improve severe hirsutism. To avoid estrogen deficiency problems, 'add back' therapy with estrogen-progestogen or COCs is advisable. This method of treatment is complicated and expensive, limiting its use to severe forms of ovarian hyperandrogenism with hyperinsulinemia. The third-generation COCs, containing new progestogens or cyproterone, have very restricted effectiveness in the short term (6 cycles), but their long term use (> 12 cycles) cures mild-to-moderate hirsutism and improves severe hirsutism. As well as suppressing gonadotropins and ovarian androgen steroidogenesis, these formulations decrease free testosterone levels and may also decrease adrenal androgen production. In women being treated with antiandrogens, COCs are important to provide control of the menstrual cycle and contraception. Cyproterone, a progestational agent, inhibits gonadotropin secretion and blocks androgen action. It is used in COCs or in a reverse sequential regimen. In the latter, it is very effective in the short term treatment of hirsutism. Spironolactone blocks androgen receptors. Its effectiveness in hirsutism is dosage-dependent: low dosages are less active than other antiandrogens, whereas high dosages (200 mg/day) are very effective at the cost of several adverse effects (particularly dysfunctional uterine bleeding), but the concomitant use of a COC may prevent these. Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptors and inhibits hair growth. It is very effective in treating hirsutism within 6 to 12 months. Dry skin is very frequent during treatment with flutamide, and hepatotoxicity is possible at high dosages. Finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, is the least effective antiandrogen, but a dosage of 5 mg/day decreases hirsutism without adverse effects. Pregnancy must be avoided during therapy with antiandrogens because of the possible risk of abnormal development of a male fetus. Antiandrogens, especially flutamide (250 to 500 mg/day) and cyproterone (12.5 to 50 mg/day in a reverse sequential regimen), alone or in association with COCs, seem to be the most effective agents for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Prostate cancer incidence among finasteride and α-blocker users in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^7a6caa4c]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

All drugs in clinical use for treatment of BPH in Finland are reimbursable and available only through a physician's prescription. During the study period, these included 5 α -reductase inhibitor, finasteride, and alpha-blockers, tamsulosin (since 1996) and alfuzosin (since 1997). Finasteride prescribed for treatment of androgenic alopecia was not reimbursable and thus not recorded by the prescription database.

Amount of medication use was defined as daily doses in treatment of BPH: finasteride 5 mg, tamsulosin 0.4 mg and alfuzosin 10 mg per day. The cumulative number of daily doses during the study period was calculated for each person based on dosage, package size and number of packages bought each year. Cumulative amounts of tamsulosin and alfuzosin use were summed to obtain total usage of alpha-blockers.

Statistical analysis

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prostate cancer by medication usage. Men who used neither finasteride nor alpha-blockers were used as the reference group in all analyses on risk.

Each man in the study population contributed person time from the date of the first screening test until date of diagnosis, emigration from the study area, death or end of study period (31 December 2004), whichever came first.

Time-dependent Cox regression model with adjustment for age (continuous time-dependent covariate; P < 0.001 in the model), family history (father, brother or son diagnosed with prostate cancer; P = 0.916), simultaneous use of the other group of BPH drugs (P = 0.07 for finasteride or P = 0.847 for alpha-blockers), number of PSA screens attended (continuous time-dependent covariate; P < 0.001) and the calendar period of screening test (before or after year 2000; P = 0.209) was used for analyses. Additional adjustment for BMI (P = 0.854) and prostate volume (as measured by a urologist in a transrectal ultrasound examination; P = 0.047) was used in subgroup analyses of men with this information available (3130 men attending the third screening round in 2004). Age was the single most influential covariate in the model.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Do not split tadalafil tablets; entire dose should be taken.

2.1 Tadalafil Tablets for Use as Needed for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of tadalafil tablets for use as needed in most patients is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity.
The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients.
Tadalafil tablets for use as needed were shown to improve erectile function compared to placebo up to 36 hours following dosing. Therefore, when advising patients on optimal use of tadalafil tablets, this should be taken into consideration.

2.2 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 2.5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.
The tadalafil tablets dose for once daily use may be increased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability.

2.3 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day.
When therapy for BPH is initiated with tadalafil tablets and finasteride, the recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day for up to 26 weeks.

2.4 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.

2.5 Use with Food

### 5 α-reductase inhibitor treatment of prostatic diseases: background and practical implications [^0ba96de3]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

This literature review discusses the theoretical background of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) treatment and the resulting clinical implications. A Medline-based search for peer-reviewed articles addressing 5ARIs, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer was performed. The 5ARIs Finasteride and Dutasteride, which specifically inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone by acting as competitive inhibitors of 5alpha-reductase, are clinically well tolerated and represent an effective treatment option for benign prostatic obstruction. Finasteride is the first compound which has a proven efficacy in chemoprevention of prostate cancer. The aim of this review was to elucidate, if there are sufficient data available to point out clinically relevant differences between the drugs. Both compounds achieve a significant reduction of prostate volume, an improvement of symptoms and a lower risk of acute urinary retention. Whether the different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Finasteride and Dutasteride are of clinical importance cannot be judged at this time.

### Follow-up of 1 mg finasteride treatment of male pattern baldness-difference between clinical trials and private office follow-up: influences on prescribing habits evaluated [^90649cbe]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Finasteride (Propecia) was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treating men with androgenetic alopecia. The published clinical trials demonstrated statistical differences between drug and placebo. Rarely do new drugs undergo further non-drug-company-sponsored studies of efficacy. Concerns about clinical studies and marketing of drugs prompted this evaluation of a large group of patients taking this medication.

Objective

Finasteride usage offered an opportunity not only to understand the acceptance of a cosmetically oriented medication, but also to evaluate subjective comments and compliance after a long period of time.

Methods

A total of 1261 patients were monitored with phone calls every 3 months after finasteride was initially prescribed. After 12 months, a detailed questionnaire was sent to all patients with an additional letter and two telephone calls if no response was received. Statistical analysis of the patients' data was made.

Results

Thirty-two percent or 414 men continued to take finasteride daily for 1 to 3 years. Twenty-four percent or 297 men discontinued the drug between 3 and 15 months owing to poor results. The remaining 44% or 549 men were lost to follow-up despite numerous attempts to contact them.

Conclusion

A total of 414 men continued to take the medication, but only 211 returned detailed questionnaires. A small percentage of this group felt that they grew hair. The remaining patients noted poor results.

### Intermittent low-dose finasteride administration is effective for treatment of hirsutism in adolescent girls: a pilot study [^16502210]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Hirsutism has negative impact on adolescent psychosocial development for both cosmetic and endocrine reasons. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a new intermittent, low-dose finasteride regimen consisting of 2.5 mg of drug given every 3 days (1 day of treatment, 2 days of drug withdrawal) for 6 months in girls with hirsutism by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or idiopathic hirsutism (IH).

Design and Participants

Twenty-eight girls (15–19 y old) with hirsutism were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups and treated for 6 months. Fourteen patients (7 with IH, 7 with PCOS) received finasteride; fourteen patients (7 with IH, 7 with PCOS) received placebo. Hirsutism score (HS), clinical, and hormonal effects were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

In patients treated with finasteride, the HS value at 6 months was 52.9% lower than that observed at baseline in girls with IH, and 52.8% lower in girls with PCOS (P < .0001 for both). Similarly, the 3α-17 β-androstenediol glucuronide serum levels were decreased by 34.8% in patients with IH, and by 47.5% in patients with PCOS (P < .0001, respectively). Finasteride treatment was well tolerated and did not alter values of BMI, serum levels of sexual hormones, metabolic parameters related to liver and kidney function as well as glycemic and lipidic asset.

Conclusions

A low-dose of finasteride, given every 3 days, reduces the HS in young patients affected by PCOS or IH. Compared with conventional continuous finasteride administration, the intermittent low-dose regimen has similar efficacy with the advantage to be safer and less expensive.

### Evaluation of efficacy and safety of finasteride 1 mg in 3177 Japanese men with androgenetic alopecia [^49ca8a2e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Before now, there has been no study of finasteride use exceeding 1 year in Japanese men with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) except the study subsequently conducted from the development phase. Since the launch of finasteride, no study in a larger population had been reported. Ethnic variation of the onset age, progressive nature and degree of hair loss of androgenetic alopecia are known. The therapeutic effect of oral finasteride (Propecia) was examined on androgenetic alopecia of Japanese men. The efficacy and safety of finasteride (1 mg tablet) was evaluated in Japanese men with AGA in the long term. The study enrolled 3177 men given finasteride 1 mg/day from January 2006 to June 2009 at our clinic. Efficacy was evaluated in 2561 men by the modified global photographic assessment; the photographs were assessed using the standardized 7-point rating scale. Safety data were assessed by interviews and laboratory tests in all men enrolled in the study. The overall effect of hair growth was seen in 2230 of 2561 men (87.1%), in whom hair greatly (11.1%), moderately (36.5%) and slightly (39.5%) increased. The response rate improved with increasing duration of treatment. Adverse reactions occurred in 0.7% (23/3177) of men; seven men discontinued treatment based on risk-benefit considerations. No specific safety problems associated with long-term use were observed. This study represents data collected at a single institution. Many patients did not receive follow-up examination. In Japanese men with AGA, oral finasteride used in the long-term study maintained progressive hair regrowth without recognized side-effect.

Methods

Patients

This study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and Pusan National University Hospital. We identified the electronic medical records of male patients with AGA who were treated in a tertiary or a secondary hospital with oral finasteride for at least 5 years between May 2004 and August 2017. Their medical records and clinical photographs were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were: (i) patients who started the treatment of finasteride at the age of 18–40 years; (ii) those who were treated only with finasteride (1 mg/day); (iii) those who visited regularly (3 months ± 1 month, 6 months ± 1 month, 1 year ± 2 months, 2 years ± 3 months, 3 years ± 3 months and 5 years ± 3 months after starting to take finasteride); and (iv) those who exhibited good compliance (drug off period < 10% of total treatment period).

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^80cdca6b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of finasteride PO (also known as Proscar, Proscar) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Finasteride is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women or females trying to conceive should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets. Finasteride and other 5-α-reductase inhibitors, by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to 5-α-dihydrotestosterone, have the ability to cause abnormalities in the external genitalia of the male fetus if administered to pregnant females. The drug finasteride PO (also known as Proscar, Proscar) is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### Topical finasteride: a potential therapeutic option for hidradenitis suppurativa [^2cb3ed7c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a multifactorial disease characterized by the progression of nodules to deep‐seated lesions, with subsequent scarring and suppuration. The exact etiology of HS is still unproven. Multiple therapies have been described, including topical, systemic, surgical, and physical treatments. At present, topicaltherapy include cleansers, and antibiotics. Androgens are implicated in skin physiology and may have a role in HS worsening. Consequently, the administration of systemic antiandrogen therapy were described in a small population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that describes topical antiandrogen therapy in HS. Here we describe 4 patients that received a commercially available topical finasteride on 2–3 HS affected sites at dosage 50 μl of 2275 mg/ml for each area (Table 1). Patients did not alter their hygiene or antiseptic habits during topical finasteride application.

TABLE 1
Patients' epidemiologic features and HS therapies

Case 1: A 28‐year‐old man affected by HS for 12 years, with lesions in axillae, gluteal and inguinal region. He received multiple HS treatments with disease recurrence and discontinuation (Table 1). Recently he experienced frequent inflammatory episodes of three nodules in the left axilla and one nodule in the right axilla. Disease severity, was: Hurley II, international HS severity (IHS4): 6, dermatology life quality index (DLQI): 16. Daily topical finasteride was introduced on both axillae. Three months later, a significant improvement was observed (IHS4: 2, DLQI: 8, Figure 1A–D).

FIGURE 1
Clinical images of the left and right axillary folds of two patients affected by HS (A–h). Images were acquired before (A, B, E, F) and after 3 months of topical application of finasteride (C, D, G, H). It is possible to recognize the presence of 4 inflammatory nodules in the axillary regions of the first patient (A, B) and the remission of acute inflammation with the persistence of postinflammatory erythema after therapy (C, D). We can observe two inflammatory fistula in the axillary regions of the patient presented as case number 3 (E, F) and the remission of acute inflammation in both areas after 3 months of topical application of finasteride (G, H).

### Finasteride (Propecia) [^09debba1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Distribution

Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44–96 liters; n = 15). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing.

Finasteride has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Semen levels have been measured in 35 men taking finasteride 1 mg/day for 6 weeks. In 60% (21 of 35) of the samples, finasteride levels were undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL). The mean finasteride level was 0.26 ng/mL and the highest level measured was 1.52 ng/mL. Using the highest semen level measured and assuming 100% absorption from a 5-mL ejaculate per day, human exposure through vaginal absorption would be up to 7.6 ng per day, which is 650-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 µg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1) .]

Metabolism

Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme subfamily. Two metabolites, the t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites, have been identified that possess no more than 20% of the 5α-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride.

Excretion

Following intravenous infusion in healthy young subjects (n = 15), mean plasma clearance of finasteride was 165 mL/min (range, 70–279 mL/min). Mean terminal half-life in plasma was 4.5 hours (range, 3.3–13.4 hours; n = 12). Following an oral dose of14C-finasteride in man (n = 6), a mean of 39% (range, 32–46%) of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites; 57% (range, 51–64%) was excreted in the feces.

Mean terminal half-life is approximately 5–6 hours in men 18–60 years of age and 8 hours in men more than 70 years of age.

### Marked suppression of dihydrotestosterone in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia by dutasteride, a dual 5 α-reductase inhibitor [^380284e8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the primary metabolite of testosterone in the prostate and skin. Testosterone is converted to DHT by 5alpha-reductase, which exists in two isoenzyme forms (types 1 and 2). DHT is associated with development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and reduction in its level with 5alpha-reductase inhibitors improves the symptoms associated with BPH and reduces the risk of acute urinary retention and prostate surgery. A selective inhibitor of the type 2 isoenzyme (finasteride) has been shown to decrease serum DHT by about 70%. We hypothesized that inhibition of both isoenzymes with the dual inhibitor dutasteride would more effectively suppress serum DHT levels than selective inhibition of only the type 2 isoenzyme. A total of 399 patients with BPH were randomized to receive once-daily dosing for 24 wk of dutasteride (0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 mg), 5 mg finasteride, or placebo. The mean percent decrease in DHT was 98.4 ± 1.2% with 5.0 mg dutasteride and 94.7 ± 3.3% with 0.5 mg dutasteride, significantly lower (P < 0.001) and with less variability than the 70.8 ± 18.3% suppression observed with 5 mg finasteride. Mean testosterone levels increased but remained in the normal range for all treatment groups. Dutasteride appeared to be well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo.
