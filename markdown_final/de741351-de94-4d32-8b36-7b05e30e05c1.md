## Question

Tenodesis of the biceps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about biceps tenodesis — what it is, when it's indicated, how it compares to alternatives, and key considerations for technique and outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what biceps tenodesis is and its core indications. Then, I should compare open versus arthroscopic approaches. Next, I will evaluate fixation location and construct choice. After that, I should contrast tenodesis with tenotomy using high-level evidence. I will then consider special scenarios like SLAP II lesions and concomitant rotator cuff repair, followed by subscapularis tears. Finally, I need to appraise complications, patient preferences, demographics, and synthesize an evidence-based recommendation with caveats about study quality while double-checking for any internal inconsistencies that need correction [^1155rXmr] [^114mF4UG] [^115YrXue] [^111xdtZ7] [^1163rdjo] [^114mPVT5] [^1156EQAi] [^116fqHRv] [^113Unto2].

> Let me first confirm the procedure and clinical context. Biceps tenodesis reattaches the long head of the biceps tendon to bone after proximal release with the goals of alleviating LHBT-related pain, preserving length-tension, and minimizing cosmetic deformity compared with tenotomy, and the most frequently reported indications include partial tearing, instability or subluxation, and tenosynovitis, with SLAP lesions also represented, although the literature describing indications is heterogeneous and often low level, so I should keep that limitation in mind [^1155rXmr] [^1154bMft].

> Next, I should review whether open and arthroscopic approaches differ in outcomes. Wait, let me verify the comparative data. A systematic review of 16 studies reported 98% good or excellent outcomes for both techniques with no identifiable differences, suggesting that surgeon preference and concomitant procedures may reasonably drive selection, and a separate comparative series without interference screws also showed no significant differences in pain, ASES, or contour satisfaction with intact tenodeses on ultrasound, which reinforces equivalence in typical practice settings [^114mF4UG] [^115W2Dnn].

> I need to check how fixation type influences biomechanics and clinical outcomes. Interference screw inlay fixation demonstrates higher construct stiffness in cadaveric models, but onlay fixation avoids a drill socket and the theoretical torsional fracture risk, and multiple clinical systematic reviews found both inlay and onlay tenodeses yield improved outcomes with low Popeye rates and no consistent clinical superiority of either method, which means technique can be individualized after discussing trade-offs in strength versus implant-related and osseous risks with patients [^115YrXue] [^113EVJ1a] [^115auu9v] [^114SurJR].

> Hold on, I should verify whether distal subpectoral versus proximal suprapectoral location affects residual groove pain or revision risk. Preliminary data suggest more persistent pain when fixation remains high in the bicipital groove, whereas distal subpectoral positioning may mitigate groove-related symptoms, but a large complication series found similar rates of persistent anterior shoulder pain whether the tendon was left in or out of the groove, with slightly more revisions when left in the groove and a very low fracture rate overall, so I should be cautious not to overstate location effects and instead tailor location to pathology zone, prior surgery, and surgeon experience [^1158hyQW] [^1156EQAi] [^111S3UbW].

> Now, I will examine tenodesis versus tenotomy head-to-head. I should double-check randomized evidence. Multiple Level I trials synthesized in meta-analyses demonstrate equivalent functional scores and pain between tenodesis and tenotomy, with the key difference being a substantially lower risk of Popeye deformity after tenodesis, a finding that aligns with older reviews and observational work on cosmesis, so patient priorities on appearance and cramping should heavily inform this choice [^111xdtZ7] [^113v7aL2] [^1154bMft] [^115CW9vZ].

> Let me consider how patient preferences and selection bias influence interpretation. Patients tend to prefer tenodesis when concerned about cosmetic deformity or residual pain, whereas tenotomy is more often chosen by those wary of implants or prolonged recovery, and editorial commentary rightly warns that nonrandomized series comparing these techniques are confounded by surgeons preferentially offering tenodesis to younger, often male, higher-demand patients, which means I should weigh RCT and meta-analysis data more heavily than case series when counseling [^116fqHRv] [^1128DDEo].

> Next, I should review SLAP II lesions carefully, and I need to ensure I integrate the highest-quality data. A three-armed, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial found no significant differences between labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and sham surgery at 6 and 24 months, with all groups improving, which strongly supports exhausting nonoperative management and narrowing indications for surgery in isolated SLAP II cases, while recognizing reoperation and blinding dynamics do not appear to change the central conclusion [^1163rdjo] [^116TVqCa] [^112VJTf6] [^114DomfQ].

> I will now examine concomitant rotator cuff repair. Let me first confirm whether adding tenodesis compromises cuff outcomes. Contemporary comparative data show no significant differences in pain or functional scores at a minimum of two years even though the tenodesis cohort often has larger tears, consistent with other series showing equivalent patient-reported outcomes, and large database studies suggest concomitant tenodesis may reduce all-cause revision surgery at two to four years, although one earlier claims analysis reported more reoperations when tenodesis was performed, so I need to reconcile this by acknowledging differences in coding granularity, unmeasured confounders, and time horizons that can invert crude signals, meaning the preponderance of recent evidence supports safety of concomitant tenodesis without detriment and with a possible modest reduction in revisions over longer follow-up [^114mPVT5] [^114n6kbu] [^113uVohW] [^114JSUdT] [^114Ru5GD] [^116Fn4wt].

> But wait, what if the pathology involves the subscapularis and the biceps pulley. I should confirm the guidance there. Because over 90% of subscapularis tears coexist with LHBT lesions or instability, preserving the intra-articular biceps risks undermining the repair, so addressing the biceps with tenotomy or tenodesis is advised, with emerging series describing satisfactory outcomes when a combined subscapularis repair and biceps tenodesis are performed, though I must note the evidence base is limited and often retrospective [^1137hE9c] [^116Cmv4o].

> I need to check complication profiles and risk factors by technique. A large series of 1,526 shoulders reported low overall complication rates, around 2 to 3%, with persistent anterior shoulder pain in roughly 11 to 13% regardless of location, slightly higher new-onset pain and weakness with soft-tissue fixation compared with implants, and a very low fracture rate, which dovetails with the biomechanical concern that inlay sockets may modestly elevate torsional fracture risk even as they increase stiffness, so careful patient selection, technique, and rehabilitation are key to minimizing these events [^1156EQAi] [^115YrXue] [^111S3UbW].

> Let me verify postoperative rehabilitation considerations, because they can influence perceived outcomes. An open subpectoral series using a dual-fixation construct and immediate unrestricted physical therapy reported very low failure rates and excellent patient-reported outcomes at midterm follow-up, suggesting that, in selected patients and constructs, early motion without restrictions can be safe, though this is retrospective and should be individualized [^113D27gC].

> I should also review who tends to get these surgeries. National database trends show that biceps tenodesis volume increased over time, is most commonly performed in adults aged 30 to 59, and is more frequent in men, with notable regional practice variation, which reminds me to consider local expertise and patient demographics in shared decision-making and to be wary of conflating utilization with superiority [^113Unto2].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing contradictions. Open and arthroscopic tenodesis provide equivalent clinical outcomes, so choose based on surgeon skill, concomitant procedures, and patient factors; fixation type and location both perform well clinically, with interference screws offering stiffer constructs but onlay techniques avoiding bone socket risks; tenodesis and tenotomy yield comparable functional outcomes, with tenodesis clearly reducing Popeye deformity; for isolated SLAP II lesions, surgery has not outperformed sham, so nonoperative care should be first-line; adding tenodesis during rotator cuff repair appears safe and may reduce revisions over longer follow-up, though earlier datasets conflict likely due to coding and selection biases; and across domains, counseling should emphasize patient values, particularly cosmetic priorities, activity demands, and tolerance for implants, all while acknowledging that much of the literature is Level III-IV and susceptible to bias, which I need to explicitly disclose during shared decision-making [^114mF4UG] [^115YrXue] [^111xdtZ7] [^1163rdjo] [^114mPVT5] [^113uVohW] [^1128DDEo].

> In practical terms, if I encounter LHBT pathology in the setting of cuff disease, I will confirm intra-articular findings arthroscopically, align with the patient on goals and cosmesis, and offer tenodesis for active patients or those concerned about deformity while acknowledging tenotomy as a reasonable, faster-recovery option with similar function but higher deformity risk; if the pain source is suspected to be groove-related, I may favor subpectoral placement to mitigate synovial irritation while balancing the small risk of humeral complications from inlay constructs; for isolated SLAP II lesions without other pathology, I will reinforce nonoperative pathways given sham-controlled equivalence and discuss that surgical choices have not outperformed high-quality rehabilitation at two years; and if repairing a subscapularis or rotator cuff, I will not hesitate to address the biceps concomitantly given the safety and potential reduction in revision with BT, while continuing to monitor for emerging RCT data to refine these thresholds [^1158hyQW] [^1156EQAi] [^111xdtZ7] [^1163rdjo] [^114mPVT5] [^113uVohW] [^1137hE9c].

> To conclude, biceps tenodesis is a safe, effective option that matches tenotomy on function but outperforms it on cosmesis, open and arthroscopic methods are clinically equivalent, fixation choices can be personalized without clear superiority, surgery for isolated SLAP II should be considered only after comprehensive nonoperative care given sham-controlled data, and concomitant tenodesis during rotator cuff repair is reasonable and may reduce revision risk, with all recommendations tempered by the recognition that many comparative data are observational and vulnerable to selection bias, which I should continue to reappraise as higher-quality evidence emerges [^114mF4UG] [^111xdtZ7] [^1163rdjo] [^114mPVT5] [^1128DDEo].

Biceps tenodesis is a surgical procedure that **reattaches the long head of the biceps tendon to the humerus** [^111S3UbW], relieving pain and instability while preserving strength and cosmesis. It is indicated for partial tears, instability, tenosynovitis, and SLAP lesions [^1155rXmr], especially in younger or active patients, and is often performed with rotator cuff repair [^113Unto2]. Tenodesis **reduces Popeye deformity and cramping compared to tenotomy** [^111xdtZ7], with similar functional outcomes; arthroscopic and open techniques yield comparable results [^114mF4UG], and fixation method or location does not significantly affect outcomes [^115YrXue] [^115auu9v]. Complications are uncommon and include persistent pain, fixation failure, and rare humeral fracture [^1156EQAi]; rehabilitation emphasizes early motion [^113D27gC] with gradual strengthening, and most patients return to activity within 3–6 months.

---

## Indications

Biceps tenodesis is **indicated** for the following clinical scenarios [^1155rXmr]:

- **Partial tearing**: Partial tears of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) [^1155rXmr].

- **Instability**: Instability or subluxation of the LHBT [^1137hE9c] [^1155rXmr].

- **Tenosynovitis**: Inflammatory conditions of the LHBT [^111S3UbW] [^1155rXmr].

- **SLAP lesions**: Superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions, particularly type II lesions [^1163rdjo] [^1155rXmr].

- **Rotator cuff tears**: Concomitant rotator cuff pathology, especially in younger or active patients [^112zXeNy] [^114mPVT5].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several **surgical techniques** are employed for biceps tenodesis, including:

- **Arthroscopic suprapectoral tenodesis**: Minimally invasive, performed above the pectoralis major tendon [^115W2Dnn].

- **Open subpectoral tenodesis**: Open approach, performed below the pectoralis major tendon [^111S3UbW].

- **Fixation methods**: Interference screws, suture anchors, cortical buttons, and all-suture anchors [^115auu9v] [^115YrXue].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Biceps tenodesis demonstrates favorable clinical outcomes, with **significant reductions in anterior shoulder pain** and improved shoulder function and range of motion [^114mF4UG]. Compared with tenotomy, it results in a lower incidence of Popeye deformity [^111xdtZ7] and better preservation of elbow flexion and supination strength.

---

## Complications

Although **generally safe**, biceps tenodesis may be associated with complications such as [^1156EQAi]:

- **Persistent pain**: Ongoing anterior shoulder pain.

- **Fixation failure**: Loss of fixation or tendon pullout.

- **Infection**: Rare but possible.

- **Humeral fracture**: Rare complication associated with certain fixation methods [^111S3UbW].

---

## Rehabilitation protocols

Postoperative rehabilitation typically includes immediate passive and active range-of-motion exercises [^113D27gC], followed by progressive strengthening once initial healing occurs. Most patients **return to full activity within 3–6 months**.

---

## Comparison with tenotomy

Biceps tenodesis offers several **advantages over tenotomy**, including a lower incidence of Popeye deformity [^111xdtZ7], better preservation of elbow flexion and supination strength, and higher satisfaction rates — particularly in younger or active patients [^1128DDEo]. However, tenotomy may be preferred for older, low-demand patients because of its simplicity and shorter recovery time [^1141wvUf].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Patient selection for biceps tenodesis versus tenotomy **depends on age, activity level, cosmetic concerns, and comorbidities** [^116fqHRv]. Younger, active patients (including athletes) or those concerned about cosmetic deformity typically favor tenodesis [^1128DDEo], whereas older patients with comorbidities may benefit from tenotomy because of its shorter recovery.

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes of biceps tenodesis are **generally favorable** [^112GfY47], with sustained pain relief, functional improvement, and low complication rates [^1156EQAi]. However, some patients — particularly those undergoing proximal tenodesis — may experience persistent anterior shoulder pain [^1158hyQW].

---

In summary, **biceps tenodesis effectively addresses symptomatic LHBT pathology** with outcomes comparable to tenotomy and fewer cosmetic issues; appropriate patient selection and structured rehabilitation optimize results [^111xdtZ7].

### Systematic review of biceps tenodesis: Arthroscopic versus open [^114mF4UG]. Arthroscopy (2016). High credibility.

We present a systematic review of the recent literature regarding the use of arthroscopic and open methods of tenodesis for lesions of the long head of the biceps brachii. This analysis addresses the subjective and objective outcomes after these two procedures.

- **Methods**: PubMed was carefully reviewed for suitable articles relating to biceps tenodesis, both open and arthroscopic. We included studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of these two procedures that were of Level I to IV evidence and were published in the English language. The primary clinical outcomes for each study were determined, normalized, and reported as the percentage of good or excellent results versus poor results based on the outcome scores and criteria laid out by the authors in each of the studies. The exclusion criteria included studies in which biceps tenodesis was performed in patients with concomitant rotator cuff repairs, nonhuman studies, and biomechanical studies.

- **Results**: A total of 16 studies met our inclusion criteria. Among all studies, 205 arthroscopic tenodesis procedures and 271 open tenodesis procedures were performed. Among the 271 open tenodesis patients, 98% had a good or excellent outcome, with a poor outcome in 5 patients (2%). Among the 205 patients who underwent arthroscopic tenodesis, 98% had a good or excellent outcome, with a poor outcome in 5 patients (2%).

- **Conclusions**: Both open and arthroscopic biceps tenodesis provided satisfactory outcomes in most patients, and there were no identifiable differences in this review.

### Demographic trends in arthroscopic and open biceps tenodesis across the United States [^113Unto2]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in procedures and report on demographic data of patients undergoing arthroscopic versus open biceps tenodesis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a commercially available database (PearlDiver) was conducted to identify cases of arthroscopic and open biceps tenodesis performed between 2007 and 2011 with concurrent diagnoses of commonly associated shoulder disorders. Each record provided the patient's age, gender, and region within the United States, and statistical significance was determined with respect to each of these demographics.

- **Results**: There were 9,011 patients who underwent arthroscopic biceps tenodesis and 11,678 patients who underwent open biceps tenodesis between 2007 and 2011. The number of biceps tenodesis cases increased from 2007 to 2011 (2,047 to 5,832; p = 0.015). Both arthroscopic and open biceps tenodesis procedures were performed most commonly in the 30- to 59-year-old age group (76.3% and 76.1%; P < .00001). Men underwent arthroscopic or open biceps tenodesis more commonly than women did (66.1% and 71.9%; P < .00001). Rates of both open and arthroscopic biceps tenodesis varied significantly among the Midwest, South, Northeast, and West regions (P = .009; p = 0.007); 49.8% of arthroscopic and 44.6% of open biceps tenodesis cases were associated with rotator cuff tears, whereas 14.4% of arthroscopic and 16.2% of open cases were associated with biceps tendon disorders.

- **Conclusion**: Both arthroscopic and open biceps tenodesis cases increased annually from 2007 to 2011. The majority of biceps tenodesis procedures were performed within specific demographic groups and were often associated with rotator cuff tears and biceps tendon disorders.

### Biceps tenodesis versus tenotomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of level I randomized controlled trials [^111xdtZ7]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Biceps tenodesis and tenotomy are two surgical treatment options for relief of long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) pathology and superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) tears. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the clinical outcomes and complications of biceps tenodesis and tenotomy for the treatment of LHBT or SLAP pathology during shoulder arthroscopy.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify level I randomized controlled trials that compared the clinical outcomes of biceps tenodesis vs. tenotomy. The search phrase used was as follows: biceps tenodesis tenotomy randomized. Patients were assessed based on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, visual analog scale score for pain, and Constant-Murley score, as well as postoperative range of motion, strength, and cosmetic deformity.

- **Results**: Five studies (all level I) met the inclusion criteria, including 236 patients undergoing biceps tenodesis (mean age, 60.3 years) and 232 patients undergoing biceps tenotomy (mean age, 59.7 years). The mean follow-up period was 23.0 months. Overall, 6.8% of tenodesis patients experienced cosmetic deformity at latest follow-up compared with 23.3% of tenotomy patients (P < .001). No differences in Constant-Murley, visual analog scale, or American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores were found between groups in any study, and of all the studies evaluating strength and range of motion at latest follow-up, only one found a significant difference between groups, in which tenodesis patients showed better outcomes.

### Immediate physical therapy without postoperative restrictions following open subpectoral biceps tenodesis: Low failure rates and improved outcomes at a minimum 2-year follow-up [^113D27gC]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine patient-reported outcomes in patients undergoing open subpectoral biceps tenodesis with a dual-fixation construct who had no postoperative range-of-motion or weight-bearing restrictions. Our hypothesis was that patients without postoperative restrictions would have low failure rates with improved patient-reported outcomes. We further hypothesized that this technique would allow an earlier return to activity and similar functional outcomes when compared with those reported in the literature.

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective outcome study, we evaluated 105 patients who underwent primary open subpectoral biceps tenodesis with a bicortical suture button and interference screw construct without postoperative restrictions. The primary outcome measure was the failure of the biceps tenodesis. Postoperative outcome scores included the Short Form 12 (SF-12) Physical Component Score, SF-12 Mental Component Score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons total score and subscales, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score.

A total of 98 patients (85%) were available for final follow-up at an average of 3.5 years. There were 2 failures (2.2%), at 5 weeks and 9 weeks postoperatively. Four patients underwent additional surgery unrelated to the previous tenodesis procedure. Final outcome scores indicated high levels of function, including the SF-12 Physical Component Score (mean, 51.5; SD, 7.8), SF-12 Mental Component Score (mean, 54.7; SD, 6.7), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons total score (mean, 89.4).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of biceps tenodesis fixation strengths: Fixation type and location are biomechanically equivalent [^115YrXue]. Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review was to critically evaluate the biomechanical outcomes of different fixation constructs for various biceps tenodesis techniques in cadaveric models, based on both the type of fixation and its location.

A PROSPERO-registered systematic review (CCRD42018109243) was conducted using the search terms "long head of biceps" AND "tenodesis" AND "biomechanics", among numerous variations, in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. This search yielded 1,460 abstracts. After applying eligibility criteria, 18 full-text articles were included. The biomechanical factors evaluated were ultimate load to failure (in newtons), stiffness (in newtons per millimeter), and cyclic displacement (in millimeters). We performed a quality analysis of the studies using the Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies scale score and conducted a meta-analysis comparing raw mean differences in data between the suprapectoral and subpectoral fixation location groups, as well as among the fixation construct groups.

Among the 18 included studies, 347 cadaveric specimens were evaluated for ultimate load to failure, stiffness, and cyclic displacement when comparing both location (suprapectoral vs. subpectoral) and tenodesis fixation type (interference screw vs. cortical button, suture anchor, or all-soft-tissue techniques). Interference screw fixation showed significantly greater mean stiffness by 8.0 N/mm (P = .013) compared with the other grouped techniques.

### Surgical indications for long head biceps tenodesis: a systematic review [^1155rXmr]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Tenodesis as a treatment for a symptomatic long head of biceps (LHB) tendon is becoming more prevalent, with new techniques purported to make the procedure faster and more effective. The determination of appropriate surgical indications for the procedure will facilitate proper analysis and comparisons of the varied techniques. This review analyzes the reported indications in the literature in an attempt to guide future research and treatment.

The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify surgical studies that report indications for LHB tenodesis. After title, abstract searches, and full-text reviews, 39 studies were included. Study information was extracted, including author, publication date, patient numbers, patient age, follow-up period, procedure performed, surgical indications, and study design.

Although indications were variable and often non-descriptive, of the 39 included studies, the most common indications for LHB tenodesis were partial tearing (51%), instability (49%), or tenosynovitis (44%), SLAP tear (28%), and positive clinical exam for LHB pain (26%). Most studies were of low quality of evidence, such as case series (33.0%) and retrospective studies (43.5%), and were of low-to-moderate methodological quality.

Although indications used for LHB tenodesis are inconsistently reported, the most common indications include LHB tearing, instability, and tenosynovitis. Other indications include clinical exam indicating LHB pathology, SLAP tears, and subjective shoulder pain.

### The cosmetic appearance of the biceps muscle after long-head tenotomy versus tenodesis [^115CW9vZ]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the cosmetic appearance of the biceps muscle after arthroscopic, intra-articular biceps tenotomy versus tenodesis by presenting subjective outcome results in patients with refractive bicipital pain.

- **Type of study**: Retrospective study evaluating clinical follow-up of patients with refractive and chronic bicipital pain.

- **Methods**: Five consecutive years of patients receiving biceps tenotomy (80 patients; 40 males, 40 females; average age, 58 years) or tenodesis (80 patients; 51 males, 29 females; average age, 54 years) procedures were retrospectively followed-up by grading anterior shoulder pain, muscle spasms in the biceps, and cosmetic deformity of the biceps muscle. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-squared analysis.

- **Results**: When assessing the follow-up questions, no statistical significance was found between the biceps tenotomy and biceps tenodesis groups. There was also no statistical significance when comparing the biceps tenotomy and biceps tenodesis groups when evaluating only the men, women, and men versus women with respect to the questions assessed.

- **Conclusions**: In the majority of patients in which a biceps tenotomy is performed, we note that the cosmetic appearance of the biceps muscle, the grade of muscle spasms of the biceps, and the level of anterior shoulder pain present with little difference than if a tenodesis had been performed. Therefore, a biceps tenotomy may be a reasonable alternative to a biceps tenodesis in patients with refractive and chronic bicipital pain.

### Arthroscopic-assisted biceps tenodesis for ruptures of the long head of biceps brachii: The cobra procedure [^1167mAfp]. Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

A number of open procedures have been presented in the literature describing the repair of the ruptured long head of biceps brachii (LHBB). Although arthroscopic biceps tenodesis techniques have been used to address partial tears or subluxation of the biceps, no arthroscopic technique to assist in the treatment of complete retracted ruptures of the LHBB has been described. This article describes an arthroscopic-assisted biceps tenodesis using interference screw fixation for the treatment of acute or chronic LHBB ruptures. An arthroscopic-assisted biceps tenodesis with interference screw fixation provides an alternative to open LHBB tenodesis. The ability to tenodese the retracted LHBB arthroscopically is a technological advance that could reduce morbidity in comparison to open tenodesis, resulting in better functional outcomes.

### The effect of concomitant biceps tenodesis on reoperation rates after rotator cuff repair: A review of a large private-payer database from 2007 to 2014 [^116Fn4wt]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to determine if reoperation rates are higher for patients who underwent isolated rotator cuff repair (RCR) than those who underwent RCR with concomitant biceps tenodesis, utilizing a large private-payer database.

- **Methods**: A national insurance database was queried for patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR between the years 2007 and 2014 (PearlDiver, Warsaw, IN). Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 29827 (arthroscopy, shoulder, surgical; with RCR) identified RCR patients, who were subdivided into three groups:

- **Group 1**: RCR without biceps tenodesis.
- **Group 2**: RCR with concomitant arthroscopic biceps tenodesis (CPT 29827 and 29828).
- **Group 3**: RCR with concomitant open biceps tenodesis (CPT 29827 and 23430).

Reoperation rates (revision RCR, subsequent biceps surgeries) and complications at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare reoperations and complications between groups. The size of the rotator cuff tear, whether the biceps was ruptured, and whether a biceps tenotomy was performed were not available.

- **Results**
- **Group 1**: 27,178 patients.
- **Group 2**: 4,810 patients.
- **Group 3**: 1,493 patients.

More patients underwent concomitant arthroscopic tenodesis than concomitant open tenodesis (P < .001). A total of 2,509 patients underwent a reoperation for RCR or biceps tenodesis within one year after RCR. When adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities, there were no significant differences in reoperation rates at 30 days or 90 days among the three groups. However, significantly more patients who had a tenodesis required a reoperation compared with those who did not.

### Onlay versus inlay biceps tenodesis for long head of biceps tendinopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EVJ1a]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Tendinosis of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) arises from various causes related to instability or trauma and is a common cause of anterior shoulder pain. Biceps tenodesis and tenotomy have been widely accepted as treatments for biceps tendinopathy that is recalcitrant to non-surgical management. Compared with biceps tenotomy, tenodesis of the LHB has gained popularity due to its ability to preserve the function of the LHBT, maintain its length-tension relationship, and reduce cramping, pain, loss of strength, and cosmetic defects.

Several tenodesis techniques have been developed to treat patients with LHBT pathologies. These techniques can be divided into onlay, inlay, and soft-tissue fixation. Soft-tissue fixation has markedly decreased clinical and structural outcomes compared with the onlay and inlay bony fixation techniques. The inlay technique is an intraosseous tenodesis that secures the LHBT within a subcortical bone socket using interference screws or bicortical suspensory devices. In contrast, the onlay technique secures the tendon to the cortical surface with suture anchors or unicortical suspensory devices. Many studies have reported the inlay technique to have increased biomechanical strength compared with the onlay technique. However, it is associated with an increased risk of torsional fracture of the proximal humerus secondary to the stress created from the drill hole used to create the bone socket. The onlay technique results in decreased revision rates compared with the inlay technique. Literature does not offer consensus regarding whether one technique is superior overall.

### Patient-determined outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with and without biceps tenodesis utilizing the PITT technique [^114n6kbu]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The percutaneous intra-articular transtendon technique (PITT) is a simple, rapid, and low-cost method for performing biceps tenodesis. Few studies examine the patient-determined outcomes of this technique in general or in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) with and without biceps tenodesis. We hypothesized that patients undergoing an isolated arthroscopic RCR would have equivalent outcomes to those undergoing RCRs with PITT biceps tenodesis.

We compared preoperative patient-determined outcome scores for patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR with and without PITT biceps tenodesis, with postoperative scores at a minimum of 2 years. These scores included the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff score (WORC), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Shoulder Activity Level (SAL). The indication for concomitant biceps tenodesis was a partial long head biceps tendon tear or biceps instability/subluxation.

A total of 153 patients underwent isolated RCR, and 131 patients underwent RCR with biceps tenodesis (RCRBT). Both groups showed improvements in WORC, ASES, SANE, and SST (P < .0001) and deteriorations in the SAL (P ≤ .005). There was no difference in the change in outcome scores between the groups (RCRBT vs. RCR) for WORC (46 vs. 47; p = 0.85), ASES (46 vs. 47; p = 0.82), SANE (53 vs. 51; p = 0.35), SST (5.8 vs. 5.8; p = 0.93), and SAL (-0.9 vs. -1.4; p = 0.46). There was no difference between the groups.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: A three-armed randomised clinical trial [^116TVqCa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In this three-armed, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial comparing labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and sham surgery for symptomatic, isolated SLAP II lesions of the shoulder, we found a significant improvement in objective and subjective shoulder scores for all three groups, but no significant group differences at either the 6 or 24 months of follow-up. As there are no previous sham-controlled trials of the clinical effectiveness of shoulder surgery, we discuss the results of the present sham surgical trial in the context of sham surgical trials in knee patients with knee pain.

- **Clinically relevant outcome measures**: The choice of outcome measures is an important issue. The scores used in this study were validated for use on patients with a SLAP lesion and capture the most important aspects of shoulder function. Both the clinician-based and the patient-based scores showed comparable results, and differences between groups were much smaller than the different scores are able to detect.

- **Potential limitations**: Issues related to sample size, blinding, the population studied, and external validity are possible limitations of the present study. This is a small study, but the confidence intervals (CIs) of the observed between-group differences indicate that the study was adequately powered to detect clinically relevant differences between the three groups. For Rowe scores, the CIs did not include 10, which the trial was designed to detect. That only 73% of patients in the sham group believed that they had been repaired may have biased the results.

### Rupture of the distal biceps brachii tendon: Isokinetic power analysis and complications after anatomic reinsertion compared with fixation to the brachialis muscle [^114MVHxU]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Anatomic reattachment of the distal biceps tendon is well established but bears the risk of complications, including loss of motion and nerve damage. We questioned whether nonanatomic repair by tenodesis to the brachialis muscle can accomplish similar results with less risk. We compared the results of anatomic repair with suture anchors (n = 6) to those of nonanatomic repair (n = 8).

Anatomic reattachment of the biceps tendon can restore full power of flexion in most cases, as determined by isokinetic muscle tests, with a mean of 96.8% compared to the contralateral side. Nonanatomic repair also restores flexion strength to a mean of 96%. Supination power averaged 91% after anatomic repair. However, supination strength after nonanatomic repair did not improve in 4 of 8 patients, achieving only 42%-56% of the uninjured arm's strength. The other 4 patients were able to produce 80% to 150% of the strength of the contralateral side.

- **Complications**: Major complications such as radioulnar synostosis or motor nerve damage were not encountered in either group. Heterotopic ossification was observed in 4 cases after reinsertion to the tuberosity. One of these patients was not satisfied with the procedure due to anterior elbow pain, even at rest. After tenodesis to the brachialis, one patient was unsatisfied because of considerable weakness.

We concluded that major complications after anatomic repair are rare but must not be ignored. Tenodesis of the distal biceps tendon is a safe alternative procedure. We inform our patients about the benefits and risks of anatomic and nonanatomic repair, as well as those of nonoperative treatment.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, more specifically with respect to reverse arthroplasty, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend considering several treatment options. These include offering physical therapy, biceps tenotomy/tenodesis, partial repair, tendon transfer, superior capsular reconstruction, arthroscopic debridement, or allograft augmentation (nonporcine) to improve patient-reported outcomes in patients with unrepairable rotator cuff tears without arthropathy.

### Where to tenodese the biceps: proximal or distal [^1158hyQW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

The best location for biceps tenodesis is controversial as surgeons have begun to question whether tenodesis location affects the incidence of residual bicipital postoperative pain. An open distal tenodesis technique has been previously proposed to eliminate remaining symptoms at the bicipital groove.

- **Questions/purposes**: We asked the following questions: (1) Does a higher tenodesis in the biceps groove result in postoperative pain? And (2) can the tenodesis location be successfully moved more distally ("suprapectoral tenodesis") by an arthroscopic technique?

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 17 patients undergoing arthroscopic biceps tenodesis and evaluated their tenodesis location, either within the upper half of the groove (five) or in the lower half of the groove or shaft (12). Patient outcomes were assessed with visual analog scale scores for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, and Constant-Murley scores. Minimum follow-up was 12 months (mean, 28 months; range, 12–69 months).

- **Results**: Two patients had persistent pain at 12 months; both had a tenodesis in the upper half of the groove. The overall American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant-Murley scores were improved at the latest follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis represents a new technique for distal tenodesis. Our preliminary observations suggest a more distal tenodesis location may decrease the incidence of persistent postoperative pain at the bicipital groove, although additional research is needed to definitively state whether the proximal location is preferable.

### Concomitant biceps tenodesis does not compromise arthroscopic rotator cuff repair outcomes [^114mPVT5]. Arthroscopy (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent rotator cuff repair (RCR) with concomitant biceps tenodesis against those who underwent an isolated RCR.

- **Methods**: Exclusion criteria included previous ipsilateral shoulder surgery, irreparable rotator cuff tears, rotator cuff arthropathy, calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis requiring capsular release, or advanced osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. Patients were indicated for biceps tenodesis if they had any degree of tendon tearing, moderate-to-severe tenosynovitis, instability, or a significant degenerative SLAP tear. Primary outcome measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test, EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level visual analog scale, EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level, and a site-specific questionnaire focusing on surgical expectations, satisfaction, and complications. A multivariate analysis of variance was performed to analyze descriptive statistics and determine significant differences between the patient groups for subjective and objective outcome measures.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in pain/visual analog scale (0.34 ± 0.09 vs. 0.47 ± 0.09, P = .31), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (96.69 ± 0.87 vs. 94.44 ± 0.91, P = .07), and Simple Shoulder Test (11.42 ± 0.17 vs. 10.95 ± 0.18, P = .06) between the RCR with concomitant biceps tenodesis and isolated RCR at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively, despite the RCR with concomitant biceps tenodesis group having significantly larger rotator cuff tears (4.25 ± 0.30 cm² vs. 2.80 ± 0.32 cm², P).

### Risk factors for revision surgery after superior labral anterior-posterior repair: A national perspective [^116J5vqn]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Data regarding risk factors for revision surgery after superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) repair are limited to institutional series. This study aims to define risk factors for revision surgery after SLAP repair among patients in a large national database.

This case-control study (Level of evidence, 3) employed a national insurance database to identify patients undergoing arthroscopic SLAP repair (Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 29807) for the diagnosis of a SLAP tear. Patients without a CPT modifier for laterality were excluded. Revision surgery was defined as one of the following:

- **Ipsilateral SLAP repair**: Subsequent ipsilateral SLAP repair (CPT 29807).
- **Ipsilateral arthroscopic debridement**: Procedure for the diagnosis of a SLAP tear (CPT 29822 or 29823, with diagnosis code 840.7).
- **Ipsilateral biceps tenodesis**: Identified through subsequent arthroscopic (CPT 29828) or open procedures (CPT 23430).
- **Biceps tenotomy**: Procedure identified with CPT 23405.

Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for revision surgery after SLAP repair, including patient demographics/comorbidities, concomitant diagnoses, and concomitant procedures performed. Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values were calculated. The estimated financial impact of revision surgery was also determined.

Among the 4751 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 121 patients (2.5%) required revision surgery after SLAP repair. Regression analysis identified numerous risk factors for revision surgery, including age greater than 40 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2…).

### Clinical outcomes of revision biceps tenodesis for failed long head of biceps surgery: A systematic review [^111HRhRj]. Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

We summarize the indications, assess the modes of failure, and analyze the clinical and functional outcomes of revision biceps tenodesis after failed primary surgical treatment of long head of biceps (LHB) pathology.

- **Methods**: A computerized search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases, along with manual screening of selected article reference lists, was performed in September 2020. Randomized controlled trials, cohort, case-control, and case series studies reporting clinical outcomes of revision biceps tenodesis following failed LHB surgery were eligible. Patient demographics, indications for revision, intraoperative findings, surgical techniques, and patient-reported outcomes were recorded. Functional assessment and pain scores were assessed and summarized as forest plots with means and 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: Five of 465 identified studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing 70 revision biceps tenodesis procedures with a mean follow-up of 2.4 to 6.4 years. The failed index procedure was biceps tenodesis in 62 patients and tenotomy in 8 patients. The most common indications for revision were pain or cramping and rerupture, cited by 4 and 3 articles, respectively. After failed conservative treatment, open subpectoral revision tenodesis was performed with concomitant arthroscopic debridement in 65 of 70 cases. Common intraoperative findings at the time of revision were adhesions or scarring (39.0–83.0%), fixation failure (8.7–75.0%), and biceps rupture (17.4–80.0%). Revision tenodesis patients reported good to excellent functional outcomes with improvements in various assessments.

### Editorial commentary: Outcomes of shoulder biceps tenotomy versus tenodesis are difficult to determine from nonrandomized studies due to selection bias: Tenodesis is more commonly performed on younger males [^1128DDEo]. Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

The long head of the biceps tendon is a common source of anterior shoulder pain, frequently addressed during rotator cuff repairs. Surgical management typically involves either tenotomy or tenodesis, each offering distinct advantages and disadvantages. Tenotomy, a straightforward procedure with a short rehabilitation period, is well suited for low-demand patients but carries a higher risk of Popeye deformity and cramping pain. In contrast, tenodesis, which reattaches the long head of the biceps tendon, minimizes these risks and is preferred for younger, active patients.

Randomized controlled trials have shown equivalent functional outcomes for both techniques, with tenotomy associated with a higher risk of cosmetic deformity. The choice of a specific technique often reflects patient age, activity demands, and cosmetic concerns. Surgeons are more likely to select tenodesis for younger, male patients. Thus, nonrandomized studies introduce confounding variables and selection bias that can obscure clear recommendations based on the literature.

### Tenodesis renders better results than tenotomy in repairs of isolated supraspinatus tears with pathologic biceps [^112GfY47]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Many authors recommend systematic biceps tenotomy or tenodesis when repairing rotator cuff tears, regardless of whether the biceps is normal or pathologic. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 10-year outcomes of repairs of isolated supraspinatus tears are influenced by adjuvant biceps tenodesis or tenotomy.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent repair of isolated supraspinatus tears were recalled for evaluation at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. A total of 249 patients (51% men) aged 56.7 ± 6.3 years were evaluated clinically (Constant score), of whom 182 were also evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (Sugaya classification). The biceps was intraoperatively found to be pathologic in 52% of shoulders, of which 39% had a tenotomy and 54% had a tenodesis; it was found to be normal in 48% of shoulders, of which 88% were left intact.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in Constant scores for patients who had normal biceps without adjuvant procedures (77.1 ± 11.7) compared with patients who had pathologic biceps with either tenodesis (79.8 ± 11.5, P = .104) or tenotomy (75.3 ± 10.7, P = .420). However, for patients who had pathologic biceps, Constant scores were significantly better for those with tenodesis compared with those with tenotomy (P = .025). Multivariable regression revealed Constant scores to be significantly lower for women, as well as patients with fatty infiltration of stages 1 and 2, but significantly higher for patients who underwent tenodesis.

- **Conclusion**: Adjuvant biceps procedures are not required when repairing isolated supraspinatus tears.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^112VJTf6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study was designed to detect a clinically important detectable difference of 10 points in the mean Rowe score. To detect this difference among treatment groups (SD = 15, α = 0.05, β = 0.80, one-way analysis of variance), the study required 36 patients in each group. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, we planned to include 40 patients in each group. In a later study, we found the minimal clinically important change for the Rowe score to be 17. At 6 months, there were no crossovers, and the results were analyzed and interpreted blindly, as recommended by Järvinen et al.

Continuous variables are presented as mean values with 95% CI, and categorical values as numbers and percentages. We used a mixed models approach to analyze the effect of the interventions on primary and secondary variables at 6 and 24 months. For each model, we included a core set of adjustment variables as covariates: age, sex, time, frequency of physical activity, manual labor, and dominant arm. Additionally, the baseline measurement was included as a covariate to eliminate regression towards the mean for the estimated changes over time of the different treatments and for pairwise comparisons. The final model was tested for confounding with the covariates not included in the final main effects model. Confounding was defined as a change in the estimate of at least 25% when a term was added to a model. Finally, we tested for interactions between covariates and all outcomes at the 0.05 level. If a significant difference was found, we applied Tukey's test for multiple comparisons.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^114DomfQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

All three groups improved on the secondary outcomes from baseline to 6 and 24 months, and there were no significant differences among the groups. In the sham group, 31 out of 37 (84%) patients reported excellent or good results at 1-year follow-up. In the labral repair and biceps tenodesis groups, the numbers were 29 out of 35 (83%) and 34 out of 38 (89%), respectively. The first 25 patients did not receive the blinding question. After sham surgery, 19 out of 26 (73%) patients believed they were repaired, in comparison to 31 out of 32 (97%) after biceps tenodesis and 31 out of 35 (89%) after labral repair.

There were no serious adverse events, infections, or nerve injuries. Ten patients experienced prolonged postoperative stiffness (capsulitis); five after labral repair, four after biceps tenodesis, and one after sham surgery (due to trauma 3 weeks postoperatively).

- **Per protocol analysis**: There were no significant differences in the changes between groups for any primary or secondary outcomes in the per protocol analysis. At 6 and 24 months, respectively, the mean Rowe scores for the three groups were as follows: biceps tenodesis 76.1 and 87.0; labral repair 76.2 and 85.9; sham surgery 81.4 and 89.0. The mean WOSI scores were: biceps tenodesis 690 and 437; labral repair 552 and 339; sham surgery 428 and 338.

- **Crossovers**: Fourteen patients in the sham group were reoperated between the 6 and 24 months of follow-up, 12 with labral repair and 2 with a biceps tenodesis. Six patients in the biceps tenodesis and four in the labral repair group were reoperated.

### All-arthroscopic suprapectoral versus open subpectoral tenodesis of the long head of the biceps brachii without the use of interference screws [^115W2Dnn]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcomes and healing rates after open subpectoral and all-arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis without the use of interference screws in patients with more than 2 years of follow-up.

- **Methods**: Patients with at least 2 years of follow-up who underwent open subpectoral or all-arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis, without concomitant rotator cuff repair, labral repair, or Mumford procedure, were considered for enrollment. Evaluations included the visual analog scale (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and satisfaction with function and biceps contour. Ultrasonography was performed to assess the integrity of the tenodesis site and measure biceps muscle diameters on each arm.

- **Results**: Forty-nine patients were eligible for the study, and 38 participated. Of these, 23 patients had open subpectoral biceps tenodesis, and 15 underwent all-arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis. The average follow-up time was 4.5 years, ranging from 2 to 9.1 years. There were no significant differences in anterior shoulder pain VAS, ASES scores, or satisfaction rates. The average anterior shoulder VAS was 0.7 ± 1.1 for the open group and 0.9 ± 1.8 for the arthroscopic group (P = .74). The mean ASES score was 90.6 ± 11.4 for the open group and 91.4 ± 13.9 for the arthroscopic group (P = .69). All patients had an intact tenodesis site on ultrasonography. The ratio of operative to nonoperative biceps diameters was 100.2% ± 12.8% for the open group and 99.1% ± 10.8% for the arthroscopic group.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^115P4FmC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The results of our trial extend previous reports of possible overtreatment of SLAP lesions and indicate a need to narrow indications. Patient age is debated, and authors advocate that SLAP repair should be reserved for the young and active patient. There were no significant differences in function, patient satisfaction, or complications by age in this study, but the groups are too small to perform subgroup analysis and identify factors associated with failures. The present study does not support either labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions in this population, as we found no significant difference between treatments in any outcome. Considering the lack of high-quality trials in this field, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution.

Based on this study, we believe future patients should be informed about the long recovery and possible complications after surgery, and that non-operative treatment has a good probability of success. Future studies should evaluate non-operative treatments and predictors of success.

We conclude that at 6 and 24 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences between labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and sham surgery for patients with a type II SLAP lesion in the population studied.

- **What are the findings**: Labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and sham surgery for patients with an isolated SLAP II lesion all led to significant improvement in both objective and subjective scores. There was no significant difference among (1) labral repair, (2) biceps tenodesis, and (3) sham surgery.

### Intrasubstance tear of the short head of biceps with musculocutaneous and median nerve compression [^113hmx4c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The decision to operate on the patient's upper arm was based on physical examination findings. The patient's symptoms did not correspond with the negative assessments made by our institution's radiologists. Initially, the focus was on the patient's mangled hand, which required emergent surgery. The dull pain and symptoms in the upper arm were initially attributed to pain radiating from the severe hand trauma.

After the hand was repaired, months of conservative treatments targeting shoulder discomfort and hand recovery were pursued but ultimately failed. During this time, the patient's swelling reduced, highlighting the medial defect of his bicep injury. Six months after the initial injury, the failure of conservative management, persistent inability to perform activities of daily living, upper-medial arm deformity, negative Hook and drop arm testing, positive Tinel sign over the deformity, and general symptomatology led to the decision to schedule surgery for what was believed to be a right coracobrachialis rupture. A good rapport with the patient was established, and he agreed to proceed with this second surgery, having had sufficient time to recover from his hand surgery.

### Onlay versus inlay biceps tenodesis for long head of biceps tendinopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SurJR]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The literature search and data extraction were conducted using the guidelines of the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. In January 2021, a comprehensive database search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. The reference lists of the original studies were searched for additional studies. The search criteria included the keywords "biceps" and "tenodesis".

The initial search yielded 2470 articles. Articles in languages other than English, biomechanical studies, letters to editors, non–full-text articles, case reports, meta-analyses, and review articles were excluded. Of the 2470 articles, 808 were duplicates. The title and abstract screening included 1662 articles, of which 1513 were excluded. Only 149 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility. After the full-text screening, six studies met our criteria comparing inlay with onlay biceps tenodesis. The data were extracted from the results of the included studies and were entered into a Microsoft Excel version 16.63 (Redmond) spreadsheet for additional analysis. The selected articles were not blinded for the author, affiliation, or source.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: A three-armed randomised clinical trial [^112ZP3dP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This blinded, three-armed randomized, sham-controlled study with a 2-year follow-up was conducted at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital, Oslo, Norway, from January 2008 to January 2014. The study protocol has been published previously. The patients, the treating physiotherapists/manual therapists, and the persons collecting and analyzing the data were blinded to the study group assignments. The first author was not blinded to group assignment but had no role in the follow-up of the patients.

We enrolled patients aged 18–60 years who had shoulder pain (> 3 months) that was unresponsive to conventional non-operative treatment (physiotherapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or corticosteroid injections) and had a history, clinical findings, and MRI arthrography indicating a SLAP lesion. Patients were informed that final study inclusion and randomization would be performed during arthroscopy if an isolated type II SLAP lesion was confirmed. Exclusion criteria included previous shoulder surgery, SLAP lesions with concomitant labral cysts, clinical and radiological signs of arthritis of the acromioclavicular (AC) or glenohumeral joint, and tears of the rotator cuff or the long head of the biceps tendon. Detailed criteria are described in the published study protocol.

Arthroscopic examination of the shoulder was performed in all patients under general anesthesia, using standard posterior and anterior portals. The orthopedic surgeon (CPS) evaluated both the subacromial space and the glenohumeral joint.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: A three-armed randomised clinical trial [^115WwKPU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our results at 2 years confirm the 6-month results with no statistically significant differences between the three groups. In addition, the comparison of crossovers, with a similar number of patients with inferior results in the biceps tenodesis and labral repair groups, suggests that the threshold for reoperation was lower in the sham group. However, it cannot be ruled out that the higher rate of reoperation in the sham group was related to unblinding rather than to differences in treatment failure. Even though there was no significant difference in mean Rowe score in the crossover group after reoperation, it is worth noting that 8 of the 14 patients had a Rowe score over 80.

We assessed 445 patients and included 118 according to strict inclusion criteria. This introduces a risk of selection bias but improves the internal validity of the study in order to assess isolated SLAP II lesions. Both athletes and patients with work-related injuries were included. Results were adjusted for frequency of physical activity and manual labour, but do not apply to a specific population. Future studies should compare non-operative and operative treatments in athletes, including return to sports in addition to the validated outcomes applied in the present study.

The choice of method regarding the biceps tenodesis may be questioned. Surgeons currently use several methods, both arthroscopic and open, with a variety of fixation devices. The point of fixation of the biceps tendon may be in the bicipital groove, subpectoral humeral fixation, or transferred to the conjoint tendon.

After failure of nonoperative treatment, repair has long been the primary treatment option for symptomatic superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions of the shoulder. There is growing evidence to support both biceps tenotomy and tenodesis as effective alternative treatments for SLAP lesions.

- **Hypotheses**: For patients with isolated SLAP lesions, the frequency of SLAP repair has decreased, while treatment with biceps tenodesis and tenotomy has increased. Similar trends are expected in patients with SLAP lesions undergoing concomitant rotator cuff repair.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: A query of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery part II database was performed from 2002 to 2011. The database was searched for patients with isolated SLAP lesions undergoing SLAP repair, open biceps tenodesis, arthroscopic biceps tenodesis, or biceps tenotomy. The database was then queried a second time for patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with concomitant SLAP repair, biceps tenodesis, or biceps tenotomy.

- **Results**: From 2002 to 2011, there were 8963 cases reported for the treatment of an isolated SLAP lesion and 1540 cases reported for the treatment of SLAP lesions with concomitant rotator cuff repair. For patients with isolated SLAP lesions, the proportion of SLAP repairs decreased from 69.3% to 44.8% (P < .0001), while biceps tenodesis increased from 1.9% to 18.8% (P < .0001), and biceps tenotomy increased from 0.4% to 1.7% (P = .018). For patients undergoing concomitant rotator cuff repair, SLAP repair decreased from…

### Onlay versus inlay biceps tenodesis for long head of biceps tendinopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115auu9v]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis provides evidence that both onlay and inlay biceps tenodeses for long head of biceps tendinopathy result in improved clinical outcomes and are at low risk of Popeye deformities, with no statistically significant differences between either method. Additional studies are required to assess the clinical significance of these differences.

### The effect of concomitant biceps tenodesis on revision surgery rates after primary rotator cuff repair [^113uVohW]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

When stratifying for both arthroscopic and open approaches, the incidence rates of any revision surgery examined at 2 years (open: 4.37% versus 5.95%; P < 0.001; scope: 4.64% versus 5.78%; P < 0.001) and 4 years (open: 6.00% versus 8.13%; P < 0.001; scope: 5.76% versus 7.37%; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in those who underwent concomitant biceps tenodesis (BT) compared with those without concomitant BT. Among those who had a concomitant BT, there was no significant difference in 2-year (P = 0.645) and 4-year (P = 0.675) revision BT in those undergoing arthroscopic surgery compared with open surgery.

- **Multivariable analysis of revision surgery rate**: Concomitant BT during primary rotator cuff repair (RCR) was not associated with a significant difference in the odds of requiring a revision BT (0.88; 0.74 to 1.04; P = 0.140) within 2 years compared with patients who did not have a concomitant BT. Those who underwent RCR with BT had significantly lower odds of all-cause revision surgery within 2 years compared with those who underwent RCR without BT (0.79; 0.74 to 0.84; P < 0.001). Within 4 years, patients who underwent RCR with BT had significantly lower odds of revision BT (0.65; 0.55 to 0.76; P < 0.001) and all-cause revision surgery.

No significant difference was found regarding the proportions of secondary surgeries for the degenerative (7/230 [3%]) and traumatic (7/191 [3.7%]) groups; 7 additional surgeries were completed in each group (adjusted RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.30–2.9]; p = 0.723). Reasons for these interventions included removal of a displaced anchor (degenerative, n = 2; traumatic, n = 1), intra-articular lavage and wound irrigation due to infection (traumatic, n = 1), additional biceps tenodesis for persistent biceps pain (degenerative, n = 1; traumatic, n = 1), or ruptured tendon and revision rotator cuff reconstruction with or without patch augmentation (degenerative, n = 4; traumatic, n = 4). Similarly, no significant difference was found between groups for any recorded adverse event.

### Relationship between subscapularis tears and injuries to the biceps pulley [^1137hE9c]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

According to previous studies, simple debridement, biceps tenotomy, and tenodesis concomitant to rotator cuff repair all have good clinical and functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, these studies did not focus specifically on subscapularis pathology. The results of the present study demonstrate that an action on the biceps is indicated in the case of a subscapularis tear. Given that more than 90% of patients with a subscapularis tear have associated LHBT lesions or instability, we believe that preservation of the intra-articular biceps will jeopardize a subscapularis tendon repair. Indeed, Edwards et al. demonstrated that the outcomes of subscapularis repair were inferior when the biceps was preserved. Consequently, simple debridement of the biceps does not seem to be a reasonable option in the setting of subscapularis repair.

This study has several limitations. First, we did not correlate arthroscopic findings with preoperative images. Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging has low sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV to detect this condition, and arthroscopic evaluation remains the gold standard. Second, the surgeries were performed by a large group of surgeons, leading to some missing values. Third, a few of the criteria used during dynamic evaluation, such as "stretch" or "subluxation", are subjective and do not represent by definition a pathological condition and might have been interpreted differently by other surgeons. However, they are part of commonly used descriptions and have been classified in the present study under the appreciation of senior surgeons.

### Biceps tenotomy versus tenodesis: A review of clinical outcomes and biomechanical results [^1154bMft]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

There are significant differences in the incidence of cosmetic deformity and load to tendon failure between biceps tenotomy and tenodesis for the treatment of long head of the biceps brachii (LHB) tendon lesions. This is supported by the evidence-based strengths and weaknesses of each procedure in the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for eligible clinical and biomechanical articles relating to biceps tenotomy or tenodesis from 1966 to 2010. Keywords included biceps tenotomy, biceps tenodesis, long head of the biceps brachii, and Popeye sign. Relevant studies were included based on study objectives; excluded studies consisted of abstracts, case reports, letters to the editor, and articles without outcome measures.

- **Results**: All articles reviewed were of level IV evidence. Combined results from reviewed papers on the differences between LHB tenotomy and tenodesis demonstrated a higher incidence of cosmetic deformity in patients treated with biceps tenotomy. Complications were similar for each treatment, with a higher likelihood of bicipital pain associated with tenodesis. Lack of high-level evidence from prospective randomized trials limits our ability to recommend one technique over another.

- **Discussion**: This review demonstrated a higher incidence of cosmetic deformity in patients treated with biceps tenotomy compared with tenodesis, with an associated lower load to tendon failure. However, there was no consensus in the literature regarding the use of tenotomy versus tenodesis for LHB tendon lesions.

### Repair of isolated subscapularis tears with concurrent biceps tenodesis using a single anchor results in satisfactory clinical outcomes: Minimum 2-year follow-up [^116Cmv4o]. Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients treated with isolated subscapularis tear repair and biceps tenodesis using a single anchor.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with a subscapularis tear and who underwent arthroscopic surgery by a single surgeon between February 2017 and January 2022 were evaluated retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were patients who underwent repair of an isolated subscapularis tear along with tenodesis for long head of the biceps tendon pathologies, such as SLAP lesion, instability, partial tear, or tenosynovitis, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Assessment included active and passive range of motion, single-assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), visual analog scale (VAS), Constant-Murley score (CMS), and specific subscapularis and biceps tests. Improvements were analyzed using minimum clinically important difference (MCID) values.

Results: A total of 20 patients were included. The mean age was 48.5 ± 7 years, and the follow-up period was 43.1 ± 12.7 months. Significant improvements were observed at the final follow-up in active forward flexion, active abduction, active internal rotation, as well as VAS, SANE, and CMS. A high percentage of patients (P 90%) achieved the MCID for the CMS, SANE, and other metrics.

### The effect of concomitant biceps tenodesis on revision surgery rates after primary rotator cuff repair [^114Ru5GD]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

First, it is possible that our study may have identified a statistically significant difference in the incidence of revision outcomes within four years of RCR performed with and without concomitant BT due to an overpowered sample, but this difference may not be clinically significant in light of the small absolute differences. Second, surgical options to address tendinopathy of the LHBT or biceps reflection pulley lesions include BT or tenotomy of the LHBT. Because of coding limitations and the lack of specificity of ICD codes for arthroscopic tenotomy, there may be some patients who underwent concomitant biceps tenotomy at the time of their index RCR in our control group.

If the main factor driving down revision surgery rates in this study was addressing LHBT pathology at the time of the patients' RCR, then we would expect these confounding patients in the control group to drive our results toward the null hypothesis being true, meaning that if we could capture tenotomies and include them in the treatment group, it is likely that this difference between treated biceps pathology and non-treated biceps pathology would demonstrate a greater benefit. However, despite this limitation, our results remain statistically significant. We think that this actually strengthens our argument that the factor driving down revision surgery rates in this study is specifically BT.

It may be possible that the effect size of the need for revision may be greater if database research had the capability to combine tenotomy and tenodesis into one cohort to compare with a control group.

### Patients have strong preferences and perceptions for biceps tenotomy versus tenodesis [^116fqHRv]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate what factors are important in patients' preference and their perception of a successful surgical outcome, a biceps-specific questionnaire was developed. This questionnaire contained a series of questions assessing symptoms, previous knowledge of biceps tendon surgery, surgical outcome priorities, and patient demographics. It was administered to 100 patients with proximal biceps pathology after approval by the Institutional Review Board. Patients were asked which surgery they would prefer. A set of χ² tests were used to test the association between categorical variables. All tests were 2-sided and considered significant at P < .05.

A total of 100 patients enrolled in the study, with 49 female and 51 male patients, at an average age of 49 years (ranging from 19 to 79 years). Of these, 64 (64%) chose to have biceps tenodesis. Factors predictive of choosing a biceps tenodesis included female sex, concern about cosmetic deformity, and residual postoperative pain with a tenotomy (P < .05). Factors predictive of choosing a tenotomy included male sex, a high level of bicipital groove pain, and concerns regarding the use of additional hardware and a longer recovery with tenodesis (P < .05). Age, body mass index, occupation, income level, and concerns regarding postoperative strength and muscle cramping were not found to have a significant predictive effect toward either procedure.

Patient age should not be used as the sole criterion when deciding between biceps tenotomy and tenodesis.

### A meta-analysis of level I evidence comparing tenotomy vs tenodesis in the management of long head of biceps pathology [^113v7aL2]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The ideal surgical treatment of long head of biceps pathology is unclear. This review evaluates Level I studies comparing tenotomy and tenodesis for the management of long head of biceps pathology.

- **Methods**: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from database inception through April 17, 2020. Clinical outcomes including Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) shoulder score, pain on visual analog scale, postoperative strength, and Popeye deformity were evaluated. Dichotomous outcomes were pooled into relative risk ratios, whereas continuous outcomes were pooled into weighted mean differences using random effects meta-analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 5 studies (227 tenotomy and 227 tenodesis patients) met the final inclusion criteria. Postoperative improvement across all outcomes was observed regardless of surgical treatment. Pooled analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference for Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score, ASES, pain, or flexion strength. Tenodesis was superior to tenotomy in reducing the risk of Popeye deformity (relative risk ratio 3.07, confidence interval 1.87, 5.02; P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: Tenotomy and tenodesis of the long head of the biceps result in comparable postoperative clinical and functional outcomes. Tenodesis is superior to tenotomy in preventing Popeye deformity postoperatively.

### Subpectoral biceps tenodesis of the shoulder: Indications and technique options [^111S3UbW]. Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Subpectoral biceps tenodesis of the shoulder may be a useful tool that can address a wide range of disorders related to the pathology of the long head of the biceps tendon.

- **Primary indications**: (1) Zone 2 or zone 3 tendon pathology, and (2) failed previous proximal tendon tenodesis.

- **Secondary indications**: (1) An overhead athlete or thrower, (2) chronic tendinopathy, and (3) surgeon preference.

A subpectoral technique allows tendon fixation directly posterior (deep) to the pectoralis tendon high in the bicipital fossa, in the mid fossa, or low in the fossa inferior to the pectoralis tendon (infrapectoral).

- **Fixation technique options**: Onlay suture anchor, onlay unicortical button, inlay bicortical button, or inlay interference screw.

Potential surgical complications include humeral fracture, loss of fixation, tendon pullout or rupture, and neurovascular injury. Regardless of the specific location or technique used, subpectoral tenodesis is a valuable tool for the treatment of proximal biceps tendon pathology.

### Arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis provided earlier shoulder function restoration compared with open subpectoral biceps tenodesis during the recovery phase [^112u2hq2]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

This study compared the clinical outcomes of open subpectoral biceps tenodesis and arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis for symptomatic biceps tenosynovitis. Although both techniques have pros and cons, no studies have compared clinical and functional outcomes during the recovery phase. Previous studies show that suprapectoral tenodesis has a higher probability of Popeye deformity and postoperative bicipital pain and stiffness, whereas subpectoral tenodesis has a higher risk of nerve complications and wound infections. This study aimed for a clinical comparison between arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis and open subpectoral biceps tenodesis.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective review of institutional records of patients with biceps tendinitis who underwent open or arthroscopic biceps tenodesis. Surgical indications included biceps tenosynovitis, biceps partial tear, and biceps pulley lesion. Patients with prior shoulder surgery, preoperative shoulder stiffness, or full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff were excluded. Tenodesis was considered when the pain recurred within 3 months despite conservative treatment, including at least 2 triamcinolone injections on the biceps tendon sheath. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, presence of night pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, and range of motion were assessed preoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively and at the last follow-up.

- **Results**: A total of 72 patients (33 with arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodeses and 39 with open subpectoral biceps tenodesis) were included in the study.

### Editorial commentary: How can I tenodese the biceps tendon of the shoulder? Let me count the ways [^115rJCak]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The debate regarding the management of long head of the biceps tendon pathology continues to evolve. Previous literature has compared tenotomy and tenodesis, tenodesis above or below the pectoralis major tendon, tenodesis to bony or soft tissue sites, and a host of fixation methods. Recent research compares biomechanical fixation between an all-suture anchor and interference screw for arthroscopic tenodesis. Although the methods have similar biomechanical properties, time-zero cadaveric data has inherent limitations, and importantly, there is a substantial cost differential between these and other implants that surgeons should also consider when choosing a tenodesis method.

### Complications of biceps tenodesis based on location, fixation, and indication: A review of 1526 shoulders [^1156EQAi]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) tenodesis is predominantly performed for two reasons: anterior shoulder pain (ASP) or structural reasons, such as partial tear or dislocation.

- **Methods**: Between 2006 and 2014, all cases of primary LHBT tenodesis performed at an integrated health care system were retrospectively reviewed. Complications were analyzed by tenodesis location (below or out of the groove [OOG] vs. leaving tendon in the groove [ITG]), fixation method (soft tissue vs. implant), and indication (preoperative ASP vs. structural).

- **Results**: Among 1526 shoulders, persistent ASP did not differ by fixation method (11.0% for implant vs. 12.8% for soft tissue, P = .550) or location (10.8% for OOG vs. 12.9% for ITG, P = .472). Soft-tissue tenodesis cases had more frequent new-onset ASP (11.9% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.001) and subjective weakness (8.50% vs. 3.92%, p < 0.001) but less frequent revisions (0% vs. 1.19%, P = .03) than implant tenodesis cases. No difference was found between ITG and OOG for persistent ASP (12.9% vs. 10.8%, P = .550), new-onset ASP (6.5% vs. 2.8%, P = .339), cramping (1.70% vs. 2.31%, P = .737), deformity (4.72% vs. 4.62%, P = .532), or subjective weakness (6.23% vs. 4.32%, P = .334). However, ITG cases had more revisions (1.51% vs. 0.60%, P = .001). Among implant tenodesis cases, one shoulder (0.085%) sustained a fracture.

- **Conclusion**: The overall complication rate of LHBT tenodesis was low. Of the shoulders, 10.8% to 12.9% continued to have ASP, regardless of whether the LHBT was left ITG. Soft-tissue tenodesis cases had higher rates of new-onset ASP and subjective weakness.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^1163rdjo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Labral repair and biceps tenodesis are routine operations for superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions of the shoulder, but evidence of their efficacy is lacking. We evaluated the effect of labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and sham surgery on SLAP lesions.

- **Methods**: A double-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted with 118 surgical candidates (mean age 40 years), whose patient history, clinical symptoms, and MRI arthrography indicated an isolated type II SLAP lesion. Patients were randomly assigned to either labral repair (n = 40), biceps tenodesis (n = 39), or sham surgery (n = 39) if arthroscopy revealed an isolated SLAP II lesion. Primary outcomes at 6 and 24 months were the clinical Rowe score ranging from 0 to 100 (best possible) and Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) ranging from 0 (best possible) to 2100. Secondary outcomes included the Oxford Instability Shoulder Score, change in main symptoms, EuroQol (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), patient satisfaction, and complications.

- **Results**: There were no significant between-group differences at any follow-up in any outcome. Between-group differences in Rowe scores at 2 years were: biceps tenodesis versus labral repair: 1.0 (95% CI −5.4 to 7.4), p = 0.76; biceps tenodesis versus sham surgery: 1.6 (95% CI −5.0 to 8.1), p = 0.64; and labral repair versus sham surgery: 0.6 (95% CI −5.9 to 7.0), p = 0.86. Similar results — no differences between groups — were found for WOSI scores. Postoperative stiffness occurred in five patients after labral repair and in four patients after tenodesis.

- **Conclusion**: Neither labral repair nor biceps tenodesis showed significant differences in outcomes compared to sham surgery for treating SLAP lesions.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: A three-armed randomised clinical trial [^116Q6LkB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The superior glenoid labrum of the shoulder is a common site of injury and degeneration, which can cause both pain and disability. Snyder et al. used the term SLAP (superior labrum anterior posterior) to describe a combined detachment of the long head of the biceps tendon and the superior labrum from the glenoid rim. The diagnosis is controversial; the validity of clinical tests, and even arthroscopy and MRI arthrography, is questioned. In addition, a high prevalence of SLAP lesions has been reported in a middle-aged asymptomatic population.

- **Consort flow chart**: The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow chart was used in this study. AC, acromioclavicular; SLAP, superior labrum anterior posterior.

Labral repair is the most common procedure to treat labral tears. However, due to high rates of complications and poor outcomes, it has been suggested that indications should be narrowed. Recent reports show a decrease in the number of labral repairs performed and a decrease in the age of the patients undergoing these operations. Release of the biceps tendon (tenodesis or tenotomy) is increasingly used as an alternative to SLAP repairs in select patients, but the evidence for it is weak. One non-controlled study reported better results after tenodesis compared with labral repair, but no randomised trials have compared these procedures. Very little evidence about non-operative treatment for type II SLAP lesions was available when the present study was designed. Recent non-controlled studies suggest that non-operative treatment, including graded exercise therapy, is beneficial.

### The effect of concomitant biceps tenodesis on revision surgery rates after primary rotator cuff repair [^114JSUdT]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Our results demonstrated absolute reductions of 0.4% and 1.7% in the incidence of revision BT and all-cause revision at 4 years in patients undergoing RCR with concomitant BT compared with patients without concomitant BT. Most of the previous literature published on this topic has had relatively short-term follow-up in the range of 1 to 2 years. It is possible that the benefit of addressing LHBT pathology with BT increases as time elapses following a patient's primary RCR; therefore, previous literature has not been able to fully capture this benefit due to its short-term follow-up.

We would argue that even the 1.7% reduction in all-cause revision surgery we observed at 4 years postoperatively in the concomitant BT cohort, combined with a NNT of only 59, should be considered clinically significant. This is especially considering the additional morbidity, time off work, and patient rehabilitation associated with even a single patient undergoing revision shoulder surgery.

### Disorders of the proximal and distal aspects of the biceps muscle [^1141wvUf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

- **Proximal aspect of biceps**: Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps may offer improved cosmesis, improved strength, and diminished activity-related pain compared with tenotomy, although comparative studies have shown similar outcomes in some patient populations.

- **Distal aspect of biceps**: Operative treatment of both partial and complete distal biceps ruptures results in better outcomes compared with nonoperative care, although the optimal technique and fixation are yet to be determined. Nonoperative management is an acceptable treatment for patients willing to accept some loss of forearm supination and elbow flexion strength, as well as changes in endurance and cosmesis.

### Onlay versus inlay biceps tenodesis for long head of biceps tendinopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MCiY9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Studies have reported a higher incidence of anterior shoulder pain associated with the suprapectoral tenodesis approach. This increased shoulder pain has been described as a result of the biceps tendon placement within the intertubercular groove, which is lined with synovium and can cause tenosynovitis. The subpectoral tenodesis approach avoids the intertubercular groove and its associated synovitis. Despite these findings, a recent systematic review of 409 patients comparing suprapectoral versus subpectoral biceps tenodesis showed no notable difference in VAS for anterior shoulder pain, CS, or Popeye deformities. Thus, it remains unclear whether the results of this analysis were solely due to onlay versus inlay tenodesis or if the location of fixation influenced these findings.

Several limitations have been identified in this analysis. Patients included in this analysis were treated with additional procedures such as rotator cuff repairs and débridement, labral repairs and débridement, subacromial decompressions, and distal clavicle excisions, which are known to influence postoperative outcomes. Multiple studies have shown worsened proximal biceps tendon pathology with larger rotator cuff tears. In addition, multiple factors that influence outcomes and complications were not well-controlled in these articles, including postoperative rehabilitation, length of follow-up, prior interventions, and the anatomic location of fixation — suprapectoral versus subpectoral fixation.
