## Question

Low RBC, high folic acid and low iron level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a patient with low RBC count, high folic acid, and low iron. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core hematologic pattern and what it implies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and the key tests that separate iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease and mixed etiologies. Next, I will examine the significance of an elevated folic acid level and whether it changes management. After that, I need to outline immediate next steps in testing and evaluation for occult blood loss. Finally, I will construct a treatment plan, address special populations, and close with a concise synthesis and safety considerations, making sure I double-check each inference against guidelines and evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic pattern. Low RBC count indicates anemia, low iron strongly suggests iron deficiency, and a high folic acid level in this context is typically a bystander from diet or supplementation rather than a driver of anemia, so the working diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia with incidental folate elevation rather than a megaloblastic process, which would require low B12 or folate and macrocytosis [^116Ln8KB] [^111Qjkey] [^111bDP7o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify the anemia by MCV to anchor the differential. Microcytosis points to iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, or some cases of anemia of chronic disease, whereas macrocytosis would push me toward B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia, so I need to check MCV, RDW, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to refine the etiology before committing to treatment [^115u8PZ8] [^117WTcDq] [^112FPnFF].

> I will now examine the iron deficiency pathway. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of microcytic anemia and typically shows low ferritin, low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and high TIBC; however, wait, let me verify the caveat that ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be normal or high in inflammation, so in inflammatory states ferritin between about 30–100 ng/mL can still reflect iron deficiency and warrants careful interpretation with CRP and clinical context [^116Ln8KB] [^115wbRKn] [^117WTcDq].

> Next, I should review anemia of chronic disease as a competing diagnosis. ACD typically presents as normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia with low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, low TIBC, and normal or high ferritin due to inflammatory hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration. I need to ensure I assess CRP and look for inflammatory or malignant conditions that could explain this pattern, especially if ferritin is elevated or transferrin saturation is not clearly low [^112xvPoq] [^117WTcDq].

> But wait, what if both are present. Mixed iron deficiency anemia plus anemia of chronic disease is common in inflammatory states such as IBD, CKD, or malignancy, and in such cases ferritin may be 30–100 ng/mL with low transferrin saturation and elevated CRP. I should double-check for this mixed picture because it changes iron repletion strategy and the likelihood of response to oral versus IV iron [^115wbRKn] [^112w7EF9] [^1123nFSh].

> Let me consider the significance of the high folic acid level. High serum folate usually reflects recent intake from fortified foods or supplements and does not cause anemia. Moreover, it can mask the hematologic signs of B12 deficiency while neurologic injury progresses, so I need to check B12 with methylmalonic acid and homocysteine if macrocytosis or neuropathic symptoms are present, and I should avoid reflexively attributing anemia to folate excess because that would be a mistake [^1123nFSh] [^notfound] [^112wJEtK].

> Next, I should review the immediate laboratory workup to confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics. I need a CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin or TIBC, transferrin saturation, CRP, and a peripheral smear. If microcytosis is unexplained or thalassemia is suspected, I should add hemoglobin electrophoresis, and if macrocytosis or cytopenias emerge, I should check B12, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and consider bone marrow evaluation for myelodysplasia [^1163Uzk6] [^1123nFSh] [^111WGg5p].

> I need to ensure I do not miss occult blood loss, because iron deficiency in adults is bleeding until proven otherwise. In men and postmenopausal women, I should arrange gastrointestinal evaluation with bidirectional endoscopy to assess for malignancy or other sources; in premenopausal women, I should quantify menstrual blood loss and still consider GI evaluation if heavy periods do not explain the severity of iron deficiency or if red flags are present [^117Fk92E] [^116Ln8KB].

> Now, treatment. If iron deficiency is confirmed, I should initiate iron replacement and treat the source of bleeding. Oral iron at 40–65 mg elemental iron daily or every other day improves absorption and tolerability, and I should expect a hemoglobin rise of about 10 g/L within 2 weeks as an early response signal. If there is malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, intolerance, or failure to respond, I should switch to IV iron, which reliably increases hemoglobin within about a week and is preferred in IBD, CKD, or when rapid correction is needed [^114wkrGu] [^114J4SK1] [^117Fk92E].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach in inflammatory states. In ACD with or without absolute iron deficiency, IV iron is favored over oral iron because hepcidin-driven blockade limits enteral absorption; after IV iron, I should reassess ferritin and transferrin saturation to document repletion and then address the underlying inflammatory condition to sustain the response [^112xvPoq] [^1123nFSh].

> I will now examine special populations. In CKD, I should follow KDOQI and VA/DoD guidance to assess iron, B12, and folate, replete deficiencies, and consider IV iron or ESA only when indicated. In IBD, I should screen and monitor for anemia and micronutrient deficiencies at regular intervals and treat with IV iron when inflammation is present. In pregnancy, routine folic acid supplementation is standard, but iron deficiency is common and often requires additional iron, with IV iron considered when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^117NdERU] [^116A1ffW] [^117WTcDq] [^113Y4JCF].

> Let me reconsider the folic acid issue one more time to avoid a pitfall. If B12 deficiency is suspected or confirmed, I must treat B12 first or concurrently and not give folate alone, because folate can correct the anemia while neurologic damage advances. I should confirm B12 status with methylmalonic acid and homocysteine when the clinical picture is discordant or neuropathic symptoms are present [^112wJEtK] [^116xLgTE].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis here is iron deficiency anemia with an incidental high folic acid level from intake. The high folate does not explain the anemia and should prompt me to check B12 to avoid masking, while I proceed with iron repletion and a thorough search for occult blood loss to treat both the deficiency and its source, adjusting the iron route based on severity, tolerance, and inflammatory context [^1123nFSh] [^117Fk92E].

Low RBC with high folic acid and low iron most often reflects **iron deficiency anemia** [^116Ln8KB] due to chronic blood loss, malabsorption, or inadequate intake, with the high folic acid typically from diet or supplements and not causing the anemia [^111Qjkey]. The high folic acid can **mask B12 deficiency** [^112wJEtK], so B12 must be checked to prevent neurologic harm [^1168LxAt]. Management is to **identify and treat the cause of iron loss**, give iron therapy [^114wkrGu], and monitor for a hemoglobin rise within 2–4 weeks; transfuse only if severe or symptomatic [^114wkrGu].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)

- **Definition**: IDA is characterized by insufficient iron for hemoglobin synthesis, causing microcytic, hypochromic anemia [^116Ln8KB].

- **Causes**: chronic blood loss (menstruation, GI bleeding), malabsorption (celiac, IBD), inadequate intake, or increased demand (pregnancy, growth) [^1163Uzk6].

- **Lab findings**: low hemoglobin, low ferritin, low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, high TIBC, low MCV/MCH [^116Ln8KB].

---

### High folic acid levels

High folic acid usually reflects **recent intake** from fortified foods or supplements, as serum folate reflects recent intake, whereas RBC folate reflects longer-term status [^1123nFSh]. It can also result from **supplementation without B12**, which can mask hematologic signs of B12 deficiency while neurologic damage progresses [^1168LxAt].

---

### Interaction between iron deficiency and folic acid

There is **no direct interaction** — folic acid does not cause iron deficiency — but high folic acid can mask B12 deficiency, complicating diagnosis and risking neurologic harm [^112wJEtK].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

### Clinical symptoms

Clinical features include **fatigue, pallor, dyspnea, tachycardia, pica, restless legs, and impaired cognition** [^notfound]. High folic acid is typically asymptomatic but can mask B12 deficiency, allowing neurologic damage to progress [^111PBHEM].

---

### Potential complications

Potential complications include **heart failure, arrhythmias, impaired immune function, and neurocognitive impairment** [^114pjQww]. Masked B12 deficiency can cause irreversible neurologic damage if untreated [^114njFj1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Essential laboratory tests

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC indices | Confirm anemia, classify type [^116SeqRE] |
| Serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, TIBC | Confirm iron deficiency [^116Ln8KB] |
| Serum folate, RBC folate | Assess folate status [^111PBHEM] |
| Serum vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine | Exclude B12 deficiency [^116xLgTE] |
| Reticulocyte count | Assess marrow response [^113FzNgd] |
| CRP, ESR | Detect inflammation/inflammation-related anemia [^114EUrzm] |
| Peripheral smear | Morphology, dysplasia, hemolysis [^111WGg5p] |

---

### Additional investigations

Additional investigations include identifying the source of blood loss (**GI evaluation, gynecologic assessment**) [^117Fk92E] and assessing malabsorption (celiac serology, IBD evaluation) [^111Qjkey].

---

## Management strategies

### Iron deficiency anemia

- **Identify and treat the cause**: stop bleeding, treat malabsorption, address dietary insufficiency [^117Fk92E].

- **Iron replacement**: oral iron first-line (ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily or every other day); IV iron if oral not tolerated or malabsorption present [^114wkrGu].

- **Monitor response**: expect hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within 2–4 weeks; adjust therapy if inadequate [^114J4SK1].

---

### High folic acid levels

High folic acid levels warrant **assessing B12 status** and treating any deficiency to prevent neurologic harm [^1168LxAt]. Discontinue unnecessary folic acid if B12 deficiency is present or suspected [^114gwb6r].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is **excellent with treatment**; hemoglobin normalizes in 4–8 weeks, and symptoms resolve [^117Fk92E]. Masked B12 deficiency can cause irreversible neurologic damage if not treated promptly [^114njFj1].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education and prevention focus on **balanced nutrition** with iron- and B12-rich foods and on recognizing bleeding symptoms to enable early evaluation [^notfound]. Use folic acid judiciously, especially in older adults, and always assess B12 status when supplementing folate [^1168LxAt].

---

Low RBC with high folic acid and low iron most often reflects **iron deficiency anemia** with incidental high folic acid; the priority is to correct iron deficiency and identify the cause of blood loss, while ensuring B12 sufficiency to avoid masked deficiency and neurologic injury [^117Fk92E] [^111PBHEM].

### Reducing red blood cell folate testing: a case study in utilisation management [^115PBoH3]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Numerous studies have shown that folate testing should be significantly reduced or discontinued. Macrocytic anaemia, or even other forms of anaemia where there is an increased RBC distribution width, is felt to be one justifiable reason to order folate testing. However, links between anaemia and folate deficiency are not being observed since the introduction of folic acid fortification.

Despite what is commonly felt to be excessive folate testing in countries that have fortification of flour with folic acid, there are few published quality improvement projects focused on reducing folate testing. In 2013, Health Quality Ontario — The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee decided to limit eligibility for coverage of RBC folate testing at private laboratories to patient populations with a) low haemoglobin levels and a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV); or b) suspected gastrointestinal disorders causing malabsorption or suspected malnutrition of any cause. In 2014, Eaton et al implemented a non-intrusive clinical decision support tool in their hospital's electronic health record stating the low frequency of folate deficiency in the American population and suggesting that folate testing not be ordered, but they saw no significant effect on ordering practices. MacMillan et al found that by removing RBC folate from the list of tests available to order in their CPOE system for all physicians except haematologists or gastroenterologists, they were able to reduce ordering of the test by 94%. Physicians other than haematologists or gastroenterologists were still able to order the test using a paper requisition or by calling the laboratory. Given the rarity of folate deficiency, we undertook a quality improvement initiative to decrease RBC folate testing at LHSC/SJHC.

### Folic acid deficiency and iron overload… [^115JMsNw]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Two patients with iron overload and liver disease had folic acid deficiency. In one patient it was associated with elevation of serum iron level and reappearance of iron in hepatic cells. Treatment with folic acid was followed by decrease in both serum and hepatic cell iron levels. In the other patient folic acid deficiency was associated temporally with the onset of diabetes mellitus and with a severe and fatal bout of right-sided cardiac failure. The clinical courses of these patients suggest that folic acid deficiency may influence the tissue distribution of iron in man in a manner analogous to that demonstrated in experimental animals.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^116UL4QN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^112w7EF9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — anemia of chronic disease (ACD) mechanisms and coexisting etiologies are described: ACD is the second most common cause of anemia in children with IBD and often coexists with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Elevated cytokine levels, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, TNF-α, interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and IFN-γ, inhibit erythropoiesis despite iron availability. Mechanisms of ACD include reduced iron absorption from enterocytes, functional iron deficiency (FID), downregulation of erythropoiesis due to inhibited erythropoietin release and decreased receptor density ("EPO resistance"), enhanced erythrophagocytosis with a shorter red blood cell lifespan, and premature apoptosis of BFU-E. Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency can present with macrocytic anemia, and folic acid deficiency is uncommon and mostly occurs secondary to drugs including sulfasalazine and methotrexate. The figure notes a complex, multifactorial etiology with many patients having a combination of IDA and ACD, and that anemia can also result from vitamin deficiencies or from drug-related bone marrow suppression.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Folate supplementation in people with sickle cell disease [^113nHtoq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders that affects haemoglobin, which causes distorted sickle- or crescent-shaped red blood cells. It is characterized by anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections and episodes of pain. The disease is acquired by inheriting abnormal genes from both parents, the combination giving rise to different forms of the disease. Due to increased erythropoiesis in people with SCD, it is hypothesized that they are at an increased risk for folate deficiency. For this reason, children and adults with SCD, particularly those with sickle cell anaemia, commonly take 1 mg of folic acid orally every day on the premise that this will replace depleted folate stores and reduce the symptoms of anaemia. It is thus important to evaluate the role of folate supplementation in treating SCD.

Objectives

To analyse the efficacy and possible adverse effects of folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in people with SCD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted additional searches in both electronic databases and clinical trial registries. Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of folate supplementation for SCD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors assessed We used the standard Cochrane-defined methodological procedures. Four review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials and extracted and analysed the data included in the review. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

One trial, undertaken in 1983, was eligible for inclusion in the review. This was a double-blind placebo-controlled quasi-randomised triaI of supplementation of folic acid in people with SCD. A total of 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged six months to four years of age participated over a one-year period (analysis was restricted to 115 children). Serum folate measures, obtained after trial entry at six and 12 months, were available in 80 of 115 (70%) participants. There were significant differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to serum folate values above 18 µg/L and values below 5 µg/L (low-quality evidence). In the folic acid group, values above 18 µg/L were observed in 33 of 41 (81%) compared to six of 39 (15%) participants in the placebo (calcium lactate) group. Additionally, there were no participants in the folic acid group with serum folate levels below 5 µg/L, whereas in the placebo group, 15 of 39 (39%) participants had levels below this threshold. Haematological indices were measured in 100 of 115 (87%) participants at baseline and at one year. After adjusting for sex and age group, the investigators reported no significant differences between the trial groups with regards to total haemoglobin concentrations, either at baseline or at one year (low-quality evidence). It is important to note that none of the raw data for the outcomes listed above were available for analysis. The proportions of participants who experienced certain clinical events were analysed in all 115 participants, for which raw data were available. There were no statistically significant differences noted; however, the trial was not powered to investigate differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to: minor infections, risk ratio (RR) 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.15) (low-quality evidence); major infections, RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.66) (low-quality evidence); dactylitis, RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.27) (low-quality evidence); acute splenic sequestration, RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.57) (low-quality evidence); or episodes of pain, RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.92) (low-quality evidence). However, the investigators reported a higher proportion of repeat dactylitis episodes in the placebo group, with two or more attacks occurring in 10 of 56 participants compared to two of 59 in the folic acid group (P < 0.05). Growth, determined by height-for-age and weight-for-age, as well as height and growth velocity, was measured in 103 of the 115 participants (90%), for which raw data were not available. The investigators reported no significant differences in growth between the two groups. The trial had a high risk of bias with regards to random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. There was an unclear risk of bias in relation to allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Finally, There was a low risk of bias with regards to blinding of participants and personnel. Overall the quality of the evidence in the review was low. There were no trials identified for other eligible comparisons, namely: folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus placebo; folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet) versus placebo; folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet).

Authors' Conclusions

One doubIe-blind, placebo-controlled triaI on folic acid supplementation in children with SCD was included in the review. Overall, the trial presented mixed evidence on the review's outcomes. No trials in adults were identified. With the limited evidence provided, we conclude that, while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear. If further trials were conducted, these may add evidence regarding the efficacy of folate supplementation. Future trials should assess clinical outcomes such as folate concentration, haemoglobin concentration, adverse effects and benefits of the intervention, especially with regards to SCD-related morbidity. Such trials should include people with SCD of all ages and both sexes, in any setting. To investigate the effects of folate supplementation, trials should recruit more participants and be of longer duration, with long-term follow-up, than the trial currently included in this review. However, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10 9 /L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

### Anemia and chronic kidney disease are potential risk factors for mortality in stroke patients: a historic cohort study [^116LTJeN]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, it included only patients with first-ever clinical stroke, and therefore did not reflect the impact of CKD and anemia on all patients suffering from stroke. However, compared with all patients suffering from stroke, our cohort represents a more homogenous population, with younger patients in which secondary prevention and treatment may have higher impact. Second, we had no information on the duration of CKD or anemia. We did not know the cause of anemia for all patients. For some patients, anemia could be linked to CKD. There could be other causes of anemia like folate, iron, vitamin B12 deficiency, gastro-intestinal diseases, -bleeding, cancer or chronic inflammatory illness. Third, we did not know the cause of death of the stroke patients. We did not know whether they died from complications of their stroke or from another cause. Fourth, we took all the laboratory values from the first day of admission to hospital. Maybe these values were wrongly elevated in patients who arrived in the hospital in a dehydrated situation. Finally, we may question the study's external validity because it was conducted in an academic medical centre. However, this centre is also the principal referral centre for the region from which most patients were referred.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^1168LxAt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Implementation considerations for folate and vitamin B12 in CKD — states that because absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor and normal gut function and the latter is often at least partially impaired in older individuals, assessment of serum vitamin B12 may be necessary if folate supplementation is considered, and that Vitamin B deficiencies may be identified by clinical signs and symptoms and assessment of serum vitamin B12 should be considered if folate supplementation is administered. The guideline notes that high folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurologic disease, and thus folate and vitamin B12 levels should be monitored if folate is being supplemented, and that suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (eg, RDA) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, including supplementation of folate, should be based on monitoring of severity of nutrient depletion, and individualization should include patient age because adults older than 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in this population. For monitoring and evaluation, serum/plasma/RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels should be assessed as appropriate.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in people with CKD. (1 A)

Guideline 1.5.1

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration:
Red blood cell indices:
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]
Mean corpuscular volume [MCV]
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])
White blood cell count and differential count
Platelet count
Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated)

Tests to Determine Iron Status:

Percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or
Reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent (RET-He) or
Combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait
Serum ferritin to assess iron stores
Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess possible inflammation

Guidelines 1.5.2

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases; the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):

Serum B12 and serum folate concentrations
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test)
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis
Hb electrophoresis
Free light chains and bone marrow examination

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

### The gastric sleeve: losing weight as fast as micronutrients? [^113C6fLY]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Deficiencies in micronutrients in morbidly obese patients are frequently diagnosed. Due to a limited diet for certain micronutrients, a great number of patients already develop these deficiencies prior to a bariatric procedure. Because LSG is a restrictive procedure and therefore lacks the malabsorptive component of for example a RYGB, the risk for developing deficiencies after surgery is considered low and therefore often not tested. However, because of the resection of the fundus, a number of micronutrients like iron and vitamin B12 are less likely to be absorbed, and the low risk status for developing deficiencies can be questioned.

In the past, a number of publications presented data on micronutrient deficiencies found after partial gastrectomy for the treatment for ulcer disease. Iron, folate, and vitamin B12 deficiencies were most frequently reported. Long-term follow-up was advised to identify anemia, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies.

During the first year of follow-up, we found that anemia was identified in almost a third of patients. This implicates that preventing and screening for anemia and possible deficiencies leading to anemia should be one of the priorities in postoperative care. Although only eight patients developed abnormal MCVs it is likely that, with 23 (43%) patients developing iron deficiency and eight (15%) patients developing folate deficiency, these two deficiencies eventually contribute to the number of anemic patients. The iron deficiencies found can be partially explained by pre-existing shortage, but also by the LSG itself. Iron needs to be transformed to an absorbable form by hydrochloric acid in the normal stomach. The quantity of hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach is reduced and nutrients may pass the stomach faster after an LSG, thus making it more difficult to absorb iron. Folic acid stores deplete quickly when intake is insufficient. This is also the most likely explanation for the eight patients (15%) who were found to have folate deficiency. A normal individual has an average store of 2 mg of vitamin B12 that should last for 2 years when intake is insufficient. Morbidly obese patients have a higher risk of having a pre-existing vitamin B12 deficiency or lower storage levels, due to insufficient intake. Vitamin B12 uptake after LSG can become inadequate due to the lower production of hydrochloric acid which is needed to release bounded vitamin B12 in food. In the first year, five patients were diagnosed with a vitamin B12 deficiency, but it can be expected that this number will increase over the years when vitamin B12 stores have depleted.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Diagnosis… [^115nVPKP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

2 As such, iron deficiency should still be considered in all cases of anemia unless the mean corpuscular volume is greater than 95 μm 3, because this cutoff has a sensitivity of 97. 6 percent. 6 Other causes of microcytosis include chronic inflammatory states, lead poisoning, thalassemia, and sideroblastic anemia.

1. 8, 12 Ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and can be elevated in patients with chronic inflammation or infection. In patients with chronic inflammation, iron deficiency anemia is likely when the ferritin level is less than 50 ng per mL. 7 Ferritin values greater than or equal to 100 ng per mL generally exclude iron deficiency anemia. 9, 10. In patients with no inflammatory states and in whom the ferritin level is indeterminate, further tests can be performed to ascertain iron status.

Values consistent with iron deficiency include a low serum iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a high total iron-binding capacity. 16 Risk factors include low birth weight, history of prematurity, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding beyond four months of life, and weaning to whole milk and complementary foods without iron-fortified foods. 16 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening children from low-income or newly immigrated families at nine to 12 months of age, and consideration of screening for preterm and low-birth-weight infants before six months of age if they are not given iron-fortified formula. 4, 15, 16 In pregnant patients, poor compliance or intolerance should be considered, and parenteral iron may produce a better response.
15. Excessive or irregular menstrual bleeding affects 9 to 14 percent of all women and can lead to varying degrees of iron deficiency anemia.

Adherence to oral iron therapy can be a barrier to treatment because of GI adverse effects such as epigastric discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. These effects may be reduced when iron is taken with meals, but absorption may decrease by 40 percent. 1 Medications such as proton pump inhibitors and factors that induce gastric acid hyposecretion are associated with reduced absorption of dietary iron and iron tablets. 31.

### Effect of a red blood cell transfusion on biological markers used to determine the cause of anemia: a prospective study [^1145nzNS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blood test results required for the evaluation of anemia are considered difficult to interpret after red blood cell transfusion. However, this hypothesis is neither supported by a strong physiological rationale nor is it evidence based.

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the values of key assays prior to and after a course of red blood cell transfusion in the emergency or internal medicine units in 4 university hospitals. The following parameters were measured prior to and within 48 to 72 hours after transfusion: complete blood count with reticulocyte count, direct Coombs' test, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, serum and erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein. We investigated the impact of transfusion on these parameters and assessed whether abnormal values prior to the transfusion became normal after transfusion (or conversely).

Results

There were 77 patients included in the study. Changes in mean values of mean corpuscular volume, soluble transferrin receptor, erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and direct Coombs' test were not statistically significant. Changes in reticulocyte count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum folate, and total bilirubin concentrations were statistically significant, but they remained in the same diagnostic category (normal or abnormal) in 79% to 98% of the cases; 97% of patients with iron deficiency still had low ferritin or transferrin saturation after a transfusion.

Conclusion

Blood tests performed after a one-time red blood cell transfusion can be used to establish the cause of anemia when they have not been performed before.

4.4.3 Inflammatory bowel disease

Anaemia is common in children with IBD and it can be considered a biomarker of disease activity. Prevalence rates are reported as high as 78% in newly diagnosed children with IBD. There are several aetiologies of IDA in IBD (Table 3). IDA and ACD are the two most common types of anaemia in IBD and can often co‐exist. In addition, in IBD patients, FID (Table 4) can mimic IDA. In FID, iron stores may be barely adequate, but iron is not available for erythropoiesis. This may be due to ACD, where iron release from macrophages back into the circulation is blocked due to increased hepcidin, or to erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents, where the release of iron into the circulation may not be rapid enough to support erythropoiesis. The pathophysiology of anaemia in IBD is based on the dysregulation of iron homoeostasis and the pivotal role of hepcidin. Limited luminal iron is absorbed from oral diet or supplements because epithelium iron stores are saturated. Therefore, in IBD, oral iron supplements are unlikely to improve blood iron status.

Table 3
Aetiologies of IDA in IBD.

Table 4
Various tests used to differentiate IDA from ACD and FID.

A recent study has shown that many children with IBD suffer from anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies at diagnosis and some fail to recover after 1 year despite being in clinical remission. The prevalence of deficiencies in this cohort at diagnosis and 1‐year follow‐up, respectively, were among others iron (56% and 27%), ferritin (39% and 27%), vitamin D (22% and 13%), vitamin A (25% and 25%), vitamin E (5% and 4%), copper (17% and 27%), vitamin B12 (2% and 5%) and RBC folate (1% and 17%). Anaemia was present in 57% and 25% at diagnosis and 1‐year follow‐up, respectively. Each of these micronutrients plays several roles not only in anaemia and the course of disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency in children with IBD can be secondary to extensive terminal ileum resection, dietary restriction in vegans, intestinal inflammation, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Therefore, in patients at risk for vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency (e.g. small bowel disease or resection), both micronutrients should be monitored at least annually, or if macrocytosis is present, especially in the absence of thiopurine use.

Refractory anemia in IBD — evaluation after an iron therapy trial specifies that if the patient does not show adequate response with a rise in Hgb and increase in reticulocyte count following a 2- to 4-week trial of an adequate therapy regimen, potential contributors include issues with oral iron (poor absorption, adverse effects, or nonadherence), ongoing blood loss (menorrhagia, bleeding diathesis such as Von Willebrand disease, anticoagulant therapy, or low platelet count), inflammation limiting erythropoiesis, other nutrient deficiencies (folic acid and vitamin B12), drug-induced anemia (sulfasalazine, 6-MP, azathioprine, methotrexate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA) due to TMPRSS6 loss-of-function with inappropriately high hepcidin; hematology consultation should be sought if no other treatable cause is detectable.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10 12 /l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Folate metabolism in renal failure [^113pmBw9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

In most patients with chronic kidney disease, provision of sufficient human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and iron replacement therapy will effectively correct renal anaemia. Folate deficiency has been implicated as a contributory factor in renal anaemia and hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO treatment. As such, the necessity of regular folate supplementation has been debated over the last decade. Although folate loss through dialysis is greater than by urinary excretion, these losses are easily balanced by a normal mixed diet containing 60 g protein/day. Thus, unless patients show significant folate depletion, additional supplementation of folic acid does not appear to have a beneficial effect on erythropoiesis or on responsiveness to rHuEPO therapy. However, a diagnosis of folate deficiency should be considered in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and significant elevation in mean cell volume or hypersegmented polymorphonuclear leucocytes; in patients with malnutrition or a history of alcohol abuse, or in patients hyporesponsive to rHuEPO treatment, especially when accompanied by macrocytosis. Measurements of serum folate are not necessarily indicative of tissue folate stores and red blood cell (RBC) folate measures provide a more accurate picture. Low RBC folate concentrations in these patients indicate the need for folate supplementation. Folate supplementation can also reduce elevated levels of homocysteine in dialysis patients, which may contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity prevalent in these individuals. High-dose folate therapy (5–15 mg/day) has been shown to reduce plasma homocysteine levels by 25–30% and appears to be well tolerated provided the patient has adequate vitamin B(12) stores. Although long-term benefits of this intervention for cardiovascular protection and patient survival have yet to be established, folic acid is considered a relatively non-toxic and well-tolerated vitamin.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^112C48BN]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1158qi3n]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Other laboratory parameters have also been suggested as candidates for identifying iron deficiency in inflammatory states. Reticulocyte Hb content is an early marker of iron deficiency that can identify patients who may respond to iron supplementation and is unaffected by inflammation.–A reticulocyte Hb content below 29 pg per cell is suggestive of IDA. The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) may also be useful because it is elevated in IDA and not by inflammation. The ratio of sTfR and log of ferritin (ferritin index) has been used to identify IDA.–At this point, hepcidin, reticulocyte Hb, and sTfR testing are not readily available in many hospitals. However, as these tests become more generally available, they may become useful in clinical practice.

Several algorithms for the evaluation of anemia have been published, all of which have different strengths and weaknesses. We suggest using the algorithm published in 2017 by Muñoz et al, as it has the benefit of simplicity and highlights the wide range of factors that can cause or contribute to anemia. Also, it is focused only on diagnosis and classification, meaning that it is not complicated by recommendations on treatment.

Consensus Statements: Treatment of Preoperative Anemia

The aim of treating preoperative anemia is to improve Hb concentration and this may decrease RBC transfusion.
Therapy should be tailored to the etiology of anemia.

Supporting Evidence: Treatment of Preoperative Anemia

As described above, preoperative anemia is associated with worsened clinical outcomes. Existing evidence also shows that treating this condition with iron therapy and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may increase Hb levels and decrease RBC transfusion rates see the sections, Supporting Evidence: Preoperative Iron Therapy, and Supporting Evidence: Preoperative Treatment With ESAs. The data suggest that treatment of anemia should be initiated some time (eg, several weeks) before surgery to enable the full effects to be attained. However, there are differences between treatment modalities in their speed of onset, and combination therapy with IV iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B 12, and oral folic acid has been shown to be effective in the immediate perioperative period.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112jmLXv]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

Treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg/ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA therapy. (ungraded)

### How I treat anemia in pregnancy: iron, cobalamin, and folate [^117MZC9U]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia of pregnancy, an important risk factor for fetal and maternal morbidity, is considered a global health problem, affecting almost 50% of pregnant women. In this article, diagnosis and management of iron, cobalamin, and folate deficiencies, the most frequent causes of anemia in pregnancy, are discussed. Three clinical cases are considered. Iron deficiency is the most common cause. Laboratory tests defining iron deficiency, the recognition of developmental delays and cognitive abnormalities in iron-deficient neonates, and literature addressing the efficacy and safety of IV iron in pregnancy are reviewed. An algorithm is proposed to help clinicians diagnose and treat iron deficiency, recommending oral iron in the first trimester and IV iron later. Association of folate deficiency with neural tube defects and impact of fortification programs are discussed. With increased obesity and bariatric surgery rates, prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in pregnancy is rising. Low maternal cobalamin may be associated with fetal growth retardation, fetal insulin resistance, and excess adiposity. The importance of treating cobalamin deficiency in pregnancy is considered. A case of malarial anemia emphasizes the complex relationship between iron deficiency, iron treatment, and malaria infection in endemic areas; the heightened impact of combined etiologies on anemia severity is highlighted.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Lack of clinical utility of folate levels in the evaluation of macrocytosis or anemia [^111xSTk6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Folate levels are routinely ordered in the evaluation of macrocytosis with or without frank anemia, yet the value of these tests is questionable. We evaluated the clinical utility of folate testing in routine clinical practice.

Subjects and Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all serum and erythrocyte folate assays performed over a one-year period at three hospitals. We determined the frequency of low values, then reviewed the medical records of all patients with low values to determine whether low folate levels changed clinician behavior. We also performed a cost analysis to determine the cost of testing per case in which behavior changed.

Results

Only 2.3% of the 2,998 folate levels obtained during the study period were low. The low levels were noted in the record in 53% of cases, and folic acid was prescribed or continued at discharge in only 24%. The cost analysis showed that nearly $10,000 was spent in folate testing per patient in which behavior changed.

Conclusions

Folate values were rarely low in the population tested, and low values infrequently led to a change in clinician behavior. Given the limited clinical value of folate tests, we propose that, in cases of macrocytosis with or without anemia, to minimize cost and prevent missed cases of true folate deficiency, empirical supplementation with folic acid should be used in place of testing for deficiency.

### Folic acid deficiency modifies the haematopoietic response to recombinant human erythropoietin in maintenance dialysis patients [^115ozpSY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While folic acid deficiency causes macrocytic anaemia in non-renal patients, the relevance of altered folate metabolism in anaemia of end-stage renal disease and its response to rHu-EPO is less clear.

Methods

Ten haemodialysis patients with macrocytic anaemia due to dietary folic acid deficiency were compared to 10 matched (age, duration of dialysis, degree of anaemia) patients with normocytic normochromic anaemia. Nineteen patients received erythropoietin-alpha intravenously thrice weekly. The study design was a prospective crossover (ABA) comparison of the effects of intravenously administered high doses of folic acid on haemoglobin levels and EPO doses, with 6 months active supplementation (B) and two periods of 6 months duration each without folic acid supplementation (A).

Results

The two patient groups did not differ at recruitment. Red blood cell folate levels were normal in patients with normocytic anaemia, but they were subnormal in all patients with macrocytic anaemia. Compared to the first period without folic acid supplementation, patients with macrocytic anaemia had significantly higher haemoglobin levels despite lower EPO doses after 6 months high-dose folic acid, and red cells had become normocytic. The removal of folic acid supplementation resulted in re-occurrence of macrocytosis and in a significantly lower response to rHu-EPO. In contrast, high-dose folic acid supplementation had no effect on response to rHu-EPO in patients with normocytic anaemia.

Conclusions

Folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly haemodialysis patients with poor dietary folate intake without regular oral supplementation and may cause hyporesponsiveness to rHu-EPO. Macrocytosis is a simple and cheap indicator for folate deficiency in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance dialysis.

Anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — etiologic workup by mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count — directs low MCV with low or normal reticulocytes toward iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with low ferritin, low Tsat, high sTfR, normal CRP or functional iron deficiency (FID) with high ferritin, low Tsat, indeterminate sTfR, high CRP; low MCV with high reticulocytes suggests thalassemia requiring hemoglobin electrophoresis; normal MCV with low or normal reticulocytes indicates anemia of chronic disease (ACD) with high ferritin, normal/low Tsat, low sTfR, high CRP or other causes; high MCV with high reticulocytes indicates hemolysis requiring blood smear, LDH, Coomb's test, haptoglobin, and Hgb electrophoresis; high MCV with low or normal reticulocytes suggests B12 or folate deficiency, drug-induced, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia.

### Folate supplementation in people with sickle cell disease [^116TA3tb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders that affects haemoglobin, which causes distorted sickle- or crescent-shaped red blood cells. It is characterized by anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections and episodes of pain. The disease is acquired by inheriting abnormal genes from both parents, the combination giving rise to different forms of the disease. Due to increased erythropoiesis in people with sickle cell disease, it is hypothesized that they are at an increased risk for folate deficiency. For this reason, children and adults with sickle cell disease, particularly those with sickle cell anaemia, commonly take 1 mg of folic acid orally every day on the premise that this will replace depleted folate stores and reduce the symptoms of anaemia. It is thus important to evaluate the role of folate supplementation in treating sickle cell disease.

Objectives

To analyse the efficacy and possible adverse effects of folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in people with sickle cell disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted additional searches in both electronic databases and clinical trial registries. Date of last search: 07 December 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of folate supplementation for sickle cell disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials and extracted and analysed the data included in the review. We used the standard Cochrane-defined methodological procedures.

Main Results

One trial, undertaken in 1983, was eligible for inclusion in the review. This was a double-blind placebo-controlled quasi-randomised triaI of supplementation of folic acid in people with sickle cell disease. A total of 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged six months to four years of age participated over a one-year period (analysis was restricted to 115 children). Serum folate measures, obtained after trial entry at six and 12 months, were available in 80 of 115 (70%) participants. There were significant differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to serum folate values above 18 µg/l and values below 5 µg/l. In the folic acid group, values above 18 µg/l were observed in 33 of 41 (81%) compared to six of 39 (15%) participants in the placebo (calcium lactate) group. Additionally, there were no participants in the folic acid group with serum folate levels below 5 µg/l, whereas in the placebo group, 15 of 39 (39%) participants had levels below this threshold. Haematological indices were measured in 100 of 115 (87%) participants at baseline and at one year. After adjusting for sex and age group, the investigators reported no significant differences between the trial groups with regards to total haemoglobin concentrations, either at baseline or at one year. It is important to note that none of the raw data for the outcomes listed above were available for analysis. The proportions of participants who experienced certain clinical events were analysed in all 115 participants, for which raw data were available. There were no statistically significant differences noted; however, the trial was not powered to investigate differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to: minor infections, risk ratio 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15); major infections, risk ratio 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.66); dactylitis, risk ratio 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 1.27); acute splenic sequestration, risk ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.57); or episodes of pain, risk ratio 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.92). However, the investigators reported a higher proportion of repeat dactylitis episodes in the placebo group, with two or more attacks occurring in 10 of 56 participants compared to two of 59 in the folic acid group (P < 0.05). Growth, determined by height-for-age and weight-for-age, as well as height and growth velocity, was measured in 103 of the 115 participants (90%), for which raw data were not available. The investigators reported no significant differences in growth between the two groups. The trial had a high risk of bias with regards to random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. There was an unclear risk of bias in relation to allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Finally, There was a low risk of bias with regards to blinding of participants and personnel. Overall the quality of the evidence in the review was low. There were no trials identified for other eligible comparisons, namely: folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus placebo; folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet) versus placebo; folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet).

Authors' Conclusions

One doubIe-blind, placebo-controlled triaI on folic acid supplementation in children with sickle cell disease was included in the review. Overall, the trial presented mixed evidence on the review's outcomes. No trials in adults were identified. With the limited evidence provided, we conclude that, while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear. Further trials may add evidence regarding the efficacy of folate supplementation. Future trials should assess clinical outcomes such as folate concentration, haemoglobin concentration, adverse effects and benefits of the intervention, especially with regards to sickle cell disease-related morbidity. Trials should include people with sickle cell disease of all ages and both sexes, in any setting. To investigate the effects of folate supplementation, trials should recruit more participants and be of longer duration, with long-term follow up, than the trial currently included in this review.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer folic acid supplementation of 400 mcg/day starting at least 1 month before pregnancy and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in all women planning a pregnancy or capable of becoming pregnant.

### Cyanocobalamine [^11497dA5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12diagnostic blood assays.

Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic.

Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy.

Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B12is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council.

### Anemia and malnutrition in geriatric hospitalized patients: a cross-sectional retrospective study [^115QDGeR]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Malnutrition is often associated with a lack of red blood cells and the development of anemia. Anemia is defined as a deficiency in red blood cells or in the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood. Iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies are among the most discussed nutritional factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of anemia. However, geriatric malnutrition and deficiencies of specific nutrients, such as the macronutrient protein, may also contribute to the development of nutritional anemia. However, whether and how protein deficiency or geriatric malnutrition in general may be associated with the development of anemia remains to be determined and requires further exploration. Understanding the complex relationship between protein deficiency, geriatric malnutrition and the occurrence of anemia is essential to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors influencing nutritional health in the geriatric patients.

It has been suggested that the role of protein in erythropoiesis may be responsible for frequently observed anemia occurrences in cases of protein-energy-malnutrition. However, the interaction of the micronutrients iron, folic acid and B12 and the macronutrient protein with geriatric malnutrition has not yet been sufficiently researched. Experimental evidence showed that low-protein diet-based malnutrition in mice leads to lower numbers in red blood cells and hemoglobin concentration compared to controls. Findings from epidemiological and clinical studies in humans are consistent with these results and show a link between chronic anemia and low albumin concentrations, without, however, taking into account the interaction of nutrients.

### Anemia diagnosis and therapy in malignant diseases: implementation of guidelines-a representative study [^113rxYM2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Although TSAT and reticulocyte hemoglobin were only determined in a small proportion of patients in routine clinical practice, we found a significant correlation between TSAT and reticulocyte hemoglobin. Thus, we can confirm the detection of iron-deficient erythropoiesis by means of decreased reticulocyte hemoglobin.

Certainly, it is not enough to look at individual parameters to differentiate ID.

Even without the classical parameter of an increased erythrocyte MCV, a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid may be present so that these should be determined directly. Vitamin B12 and folic acid diagnostics were performed in only 8.1% and 7.4% of the patients, respectively.

If only patients with hemoglobin levels below 8.0 g/dL received blood transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions could be significantly reduced. This group could be further reduced if, according to guidelines, only patients with risk factors or anemic hypoxia received transfusions.

Even in hematologic patients, one transfusion compared to two transfusions is not detrimental to the patient. A restrictive transfusion strategy (Hb concentration 7–9 g/dL) compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (Hb concentration 8 to 12 g/dL) showed little or no difference in mortality at day 30 to 100, length of hospital stay, or frequency of bleeding complications. The guidelines recommend to transfuse only one unit if possible, but in the study, only 28.3% of the RBC administrations transfused one unit.

However, it is unclear whether the requirement of only one transfusion is feasible in the practice of outpatient anemia therapy, as one must weigh the disadvantages of possibly more frequent transfusions and the time involved.

A large percentage of RBCs were transfused without indication, i.e. at Hb values between 7 and 8 g/dL without risk factors or between 8 and 10 g/dL without anemic hypoxia, corresponding to 287 (36.6%) of 785 patients without transfusion indication. Also, in the previous Europe-wide analysis by Ludwig, a very large number of patients (29.6%) received RBC transfusions at Hb values between 9 and 9.9 g/dL.

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Low vitamin B-12 concentrations in patients without anemia: the effect of folic acid fortification of grain [^114Y3fKc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In some patients with vitamin B-12 deficiency mistakenly treated with folic acid, anemia resolved but neurologic complications became worse (masking). Fortification of enriched cereal grains with folic acid has raised concerns that people who consume large quantities of cereal grains, particularly the elderly, may be at increased risk of masking. It is unclear, however, what proportion of people with low vitamin B-12 concentrations do not have anemia and whether the proportion is increasing.

Objective

We investigated whether fortification has increased the proportion of patients with low vitamin B-12 but without anemia.

Design

We reviewed the laboratory results of every patient for whom a vitamin B-12 concentration was measured at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, DC, between 1992 and 2000. Those with a low vitamin B-12 concentration (< 258 pmol/L) had their hematocrits and mean cell volumes checked. The proportion without anemia was examined by year before, during, and after folic acid fortification began.

Results

There were 1573 subjects with a low vitamin B-12 concentration. The proportion without anemia did not increase significantly from the prefortification period (39.2%) to the period of optional fortification (45.5%) and the postfortification period (37.6%). These findings did not change when the analysis was limited to patients aged > 60 y or when a more conservative definition of low vitamin B-12 (< 150 pmol/L) was used.

Conclusions

Despite evidence that folic acid exposure has increased dramatically since food fortification began, this population showed no evidence of an increase in low vitamin B-12 concentrations without anemia. If confirmed, these results would indicate that food fortification has not caused a major increase in masking of vitamin B-12 deficiency.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115wbRKn]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a combination of true iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease is likely in the case of serum ferritin levels between 30 and 100 mcg/L.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements.RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10 9 /L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate between MDS, CCUS, and idiopathic cytopenia of undermined significance (ICUS). MDS is diagnosed if MDS diagnostic criteria are met. If the patient has anemia, does not meet the MDS diagnostic criteria, and has somatic mutations associated with hematologic malignancies on cytogenetics, FISH, or NGS, then the diagnosis is consistent with either CCUS if variant allele frequency (VAF) is > 2% or ICUS if VAF is < 2% (Figure 2). Overlap exists between ICUS and UAA and possibly CCUS, depending on the CCUS definition. We favor UAA if the patient is older, they have an isolated mild anemia (eg, hemoglobin less than 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal), and, if performed, no suspicious findings on smear or BM studies of a hematologic malignancy. In this case UAA was diagnosed after other causes of anemia were excluded (Table 1).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Evaluation of microcytosis… [^1163Uzk6]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 is a suggested algorithm for diagnosing the cause of microcytosis in adults. 1, 2, 5, 17, 18, 20, 21 After confirmation of microcytosis on CBC, physicians should first order a serum ferritin level. 18–20 If the ferritin level is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, identifying the underlying cause of the anemia is the priority. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely.

Specific Causes of Microcytosis IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the absorption of iron through dietary intake does not match the needs of the body. The mismatch occurs from inadequate dietary intake or increased needs, which usually cause only mild anemia, or from blood loss or malabsorption, which can lead to more significant anemia. Young children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women have the highest prevalence of the condition. 30 Most patients with beta-thalassemia trait have mild anemia. In addition, the mean corpuscular volume can sometimes reach much lower levels than with iron deficiency anemia alone. Ultimately, the diagnosis of beta-thalassemia trait is made when hemoglobin electrophoresis shows a slight increase in hemoglobin A2.

1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B12regularly. The need for Vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5th to 7th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Reducing red blood cell folate testing: a case study in utilisation management [^111Qjkey]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

Folate, also known as vitamin B9, is a water-soluble vitamin that has important roles as a co-factor in a number of one-carbon transfer reactions. Folate is not synthesised by the body. It is mainly derived from folate-rich foods (eg, dark green leafy vegetables and lentils), fortified foods or vitamin supplements.

WHO's suggestion for defining folate deficiency is a serum folate concentration < 10 nmol/L or an RBC folate concentration < 340 nmol/L, based on the concentration at which the metabolite homocysteine becomes elevated. Severe folate deficiency causes macrocytic anaemia as it disrupts DNA synthesis. A low folate level early in pregnancy has been shown to be a risk factor for pregnancy complications such as abruptio placenta, eclampsia and congenital malformation and neural tube defects in infants. Also, low folate levels have been associated with diverse conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disordersand osteoporosis. Risk factors for folate deficiency include inadequate food intake, heavy alcohol use, malabsorption (eg, due to coeliac or inflammatory bowel disease), folate depletion medication (eg, methotrexate, phenytoin) and pregnancy.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada mandated the enrichment of all wheat flour with folic acid at an average daily intake of 100 μg. This mandatory fortification is now effective in 53 countries globally. Following fortification, the prevalence of folate deficiency was determined by several studies to be rare, averaging < 1%.

Measurement of serum folate reflects recent dietary intake, whereas measurement of RBC folate reflects long-term folate tissue stores. Folate measurement in either serum or RBCs is usually performed by a competitive assay using folate-binding protein. For serum, no pretreatment steps are necessary. However, measurement of RBC folate first requires haematocrit to be measured and then requires a manual step to lyse the RBCs and release the folate. Following measurement of the folate level in the lysate, the result is normalised to the haematocrit. These steps cause RBC folate to be a more expensive and labour-intensive test. Despite these disadvantages of RBC folate over serum folate, many clinicians still prefer RBC folate since it is less susceptible to short-term changes in dietary folate intake. However, the best test for assessing folate status is still uncertain.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SWdKS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Severe folate-deficiency pancytopenia [^115es4QH]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Folate-deficiency anaemia occurs in about 4 per 100 000 people, although severe cases causing moderate pancytopenia are rarer. We present the case of a significant folate deficiency in a 50-year-old alcoholic with a background of mild liver impairment and recurrent nasal and rectal bleeding. Her blood tests showed profound macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin 2.6 g/dl, leucopoenia with white cell count 3.2 × 10(9)/litre and thrombocytopenia with platelets 17 × 10(9)/litre. Serum folate was 0.8 ng/ml (normal 2.5–13.5 ng/ml) confirming severe deficiency. Despite these life-threatening results, the patient was stable, alert and was keen to avoid admission. Medical management of the anaemia included slow transfusion of red cells and one unit of platelets in view of haemorrhagic symptoms, two injections of vitamin B12 while awaiting assays and oral folic acid. A rapid improvement in the leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia resulted and no additional complications were encountered.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B diagnostic blood assays.

Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin.

Pregnancy:Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy.

Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B12is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council.

### The continued need for the routine assessment of folate status [^116duGDa]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Choosing Wisely initiative recommended cessation of folate measurement, suggesting folate supplementation in macrocytic anemia. This study reviewed the need for continued blood folate testing at a large SafetyNet county teaching hospital.

Methods

Red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B12, iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin results were obtained for utilization review.

Results

Of the 593 RBC folate results, 69 (11.7%) were deficient and 30 (5%) had high values. Collectively, 369 (73.9%) had normal vitamin B12 levels, 342 (70%) had low hemoglobin, 184 (62.5) had normal and 57 (19.4%) had low ferritin, 122 (38.2%) had normal and 188 (59%) had low iron levels. A total of 41 (12%) had normal folate, low ferritin, low hemoglobin, and low iron, suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. There were 11 patients who exhibited low folate, low or normal ferritin, low hemoglobin, and low iron levels, suggesting combined folate and iron deficiency anemias.

Conclusion

This study highlights the need for institutions to assess the applicability of national recommendations to their local population.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^111wtzm3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio < 13 suggesting thalassemia. In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia. In this case, the patient's other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells. For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia. The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111PBHEM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Folate status assessment and safety — describes that folate status is most often assessed through measurement of folate levels in plasma, serum, or red blood cells (RBCs), and that RBC folate levels are more reflective of folate tissue status than serum folate and represent vitamin status at the time the RBC was synthesized. It notes that usually RBC folate concentrations diminish after about 4 months of low folate intake, reflecting the 120-day life span of RBCs in healthy individuals, and that in patients with CKD such concentrations often decrease more rapidly, reflecting the shorter RBC life span in CKD. Safety considerations include that excessive folate intake inhibits zinc absorption in the gut by forming a complex with zinc in the intestinal lumen and that high intake of folic acid may mask signs of pernicious anemia, leading to undetected progression of neurologic disease.

### A randomized, controlled trial of the effects of adding vitamin B12 and folate to erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia of prematurity [^114kmy82]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Premature infants, especially those with birth weights of < 1500 g, often suffer from anemia of prematurity and associated problems. Erythropoietin therapy is a safe effective way to prevent and to treat anemia of prematurity. We hypothesized that combined administration of vitamin B12 and folate with erythropoietin and iron would enhance erythropoietin-induced erythropoiesis.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled trial, 64 premature infants (birth weight: 801–1300 g) receiving erythropoietin and iron supplementation were assigned randomly to receive either vitamin B12 (3 microg/kg per day) and folate (100 microg/kg per day) (treatment group) or a lower dose of folate (60 microg/kg per day) (control group).

Results

During the 4-week observation period, vitamin B12 and folate enhanced erythropoietin-induced erythropoiesis significantly, as indicated by a 10% increase in red blood cell counts, compared with folate alone. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels remained stable in the treatment group, whereas they decreased in the control group. Vitamin B12 levels in the treatment group increased over baseline and control values, whereas red blood cell folate levels were comparable between the groups. Subsequent analysis showed slight nonsignificant differences in baseline red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, and mean corpuscular volume values, which must be addressed as a limitation.

Conclusions

With the limitation of a slight imbalance in baseline data between the study groups, combined therapy with vitamin B12, folate, erythropoietin, and orally and intravenously administered iron seemed more effective in stimulating erythropoiesis among premature infants, compared with erythropoietin, iron, and low-dose folate alone. Additional trials are necessary to confirm these data.

### Etiology of anemia in patients with advanced heart failure [^111gdhM4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We prospectively investigated the causes of anemia in patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF).

Background

Anemia is common in patients with advanced CHF, and its etiology is generally considered to be multifactorial. However, despite its importance, precise information is lacking regarding the prevalence of putative etiologic factors.

Methods

Patients who were hospitalized for decompensated advanced CHF and who were stabilized after their initial treatment underwent evaluation of "clinically significant" anemia, defined as a hemoglobin content < 12 g/dl for men and < 11.5 g/dl for women. Patients with a serum creatinine concentration > 3 mg/dl or patients with concurrent diseases that are known to cause anemia were not included. The initial evaluation included measurements of vitamin B(12), folic acid, thyroid-stimulating hormone, erythropoietin, lactate dehydrogenase, Coombs test, multiple fecal occult tests, and bone marrow aspiration. Patients without diagnosis by these methods underwent red cell mass measurement with (51)Cr assay.

Results

The mean age of the 37 patients was 57.9 ± 10.9 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 22.5 ± 5.9%. Iron deficiency anemia was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration in 27 patients (73%), 2 patients (5.4%) had dilutional anemia, and 1 patient (2.7%) had drug-induced anemia. No specific cause was identified in 7 patients (18.9%) who were considered to have "anemia of chronic disease". Serum ferritin for the iron-deficient patients was not a reliable marker of iron deficiency in this population.

Conclusions

In this group of patients, iron deficiency was the most common cause of anemia. The iron status of patients with end-stage chronic CHF should be thoroughly evaluated and corrected before considering other therapeutic interventions.

Table 1
WHO classification of anaemia according to age and severity.

Table 2
Classification of anaemia.

Hypo‐regenerative anaemia can occur in aplastic anaemia, renal cell aplasia, renal failure or endocrine disorders. A disturbance in the maturation and proliferation of red blood cells (RBCs) may be caused by defective DNA synthesis, as in anaemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. In IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, there is impaired Hb synthesis. ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection, inflammation or malignancy. To understand the pathomechanism of anaemia, assessment of hepcidin levels may be very helpful. Hepcidin is an iron‐regulatory hormone that inhibits iron release from cells of the reticuloendothelial system and intestinal absorption leading to hypoferraemia. An increase in hepcidin and other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, reduces the availability of iron for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. It is usually a mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia and with low circulating iron and low transferrin saturation, but with a normal to elevated iron storage protein ferritin.

### The effect of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation on routine haematological parameters in older people: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^113zobdz]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Low vitamin B12 and folate levels in community-dwelling older people are usually corrected with supplements. However, the effect of this supplementation on haematological parameters in older persons is not known. Therefore, we executed a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs).

Subjects/Methods

We performed a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane and CENTRAL for RCTs published between January 1950 and April 2016, where community-dwelling elderly (60+ years) who were treated with vitamin B12 or folic acid or placebo. The presence of anaemia was not required. We analysed the data on haematological parameters with a two-stage IPD meta-analysis.

Results

We found 494 full papers covering 14 studies. Data were shared by the authors of four RCTs comparing vitamin B12 with placebo (n = 343) and of three RCTs comparing folic acid with placebo (n = 929). We found no effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on haemoglobin (change 0.00g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.18), and no effect of folic acid supplementation (change -0.09g/dL, 95% CI: -0.19;0.01). The effects of supplementation on other haematological parameters were similar. The effects did not differ by sex or by age group. Also, no effect was found in a subgroup of patients with anaemia and a subgroup of patients who were treated > 4 weeks.

Conclusions

Evidence on the effects of supplementation of low concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate on haematological parameters in community-dwelling older people is inconclusive. Further research is needed before firm recommendations can be made concerning the supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate.

3 DEFINITION OF ANAEMIA

3.1 Recommendation

The definition of anaemia in children with GI disease should be based on validated World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (level of evidence [LoE]: low; strength of recommendation [SoR]: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.1 Statement

In children with GI disease, anaemia can be classified based on pathogenic mechanisms, red cell morphology and clinical presentation (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.2 Practice points

1 Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) may cause hyporegenerative anaemia.
2 IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively.
3 ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection or inflammation.
4 Anaemia can be classified as acute or chronic according to the clinical presentation.

3.2 Summary of evidence

Anaemia is a public health problem affecting both high‐ and low‐income countries. Approximately one quarter of the world's population (almost 2 billion people) suffers from anaemia, with 39.8% of children < 5 years of age affected, equivalent to 269 million children, and with the highest prevalence rate (60.2%) observed in children living in the African region. The WHO estimates that the global prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months in European and North American children is 20.3% and 6.1%, respectively.

Anaemia is defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) level or red cell mass below the range considered normal for age and gender, which results in decreased oxygen‐carrying capacity to the body's tissues. The normal range of Hb varies with age, gender and race, and therefore, specified thresholds should be considered for diagnosis (Table 1). Anaemia can be classified based on pathogenesis, red cell morphology, and clinical presentation (Table 2). Regarding the pathogenic mechanisms, these are represented by inadequate production and loss of erythrocytes due to either bleeding or haemolysis. Based on these mechanisms, anaemia can be further subdivided into (a) hypo‐regenerative, with a decreased bone marrow production from impaired function, decreased number of precursor cells, reduced stem cell density, or lack of nutrients; and (b) regenerative, with an appropriate bone marrow response to a reduced erythrocyte mass, characterised by increased production of erythrocytes.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat IDA, first because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Second, as parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful Hb response with a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should therefore be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of IRT, and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant to oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding and concurrent deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

Logistically it may be difficult to arrange monitoring 2 weeks after starting oral IRT in all cases. Indeed because of the lower doses of iron used in alternate day regimens, a 28-day review may be more appropriate. At this point, a rise in Hb of 20 g/L or into the normal range would be accepted as an adequate response. Whichever monitoring regimen is used, intolerance and/or ineffectiveness should be managed promptly and appropriately.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### The effect of blister packaging iron and folate on adherence to medication and hemoglobin levels among pregnant women at national referral hospital antenatal clinics in a low to middle income country: a randomised controlled trial (the IFAd trial) [^114LYGmu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia in pregnancy is an important global public health problem. It is estimated that 38% of pregnant women worldwide are anemic. In Africa, observational studies suggest that 20% of maternal deaths have been attributed to anemia. In Uganda, a low to middle income country, 50% of pregnant women have iron deficiency anemia and 30% of maternal death are attributed to anemia.

Women often become anemic during pregnancy because of the increased demand for iron and other micronutrients. The inability to meet the required level of these substances either as a result of dietary deficiencies or infection results into anemia. In pregnancy, anemia has a significant impact on the health of the fetus and that of the mother. Folic acid deficiency around conception period is associated with neural tubal defects and other non-genetic congenital abnormalities (cleft lip and heart disease). It has been suggested that folic acid deficiency causes placental vasculopathy that contributes to spontaneous abortion, premature placenta abruption and preeclampsia. Similarly, iron deficiency has been observed to decrease the weight of the newborn, increased premature delivery and other complications during delivery. Iron is necessary for the placenta, uterine enlargement, red blood cell synthesis and fetal growth.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends iron and folic acid supplementation throughout the duration of the pregnancy. WHO and Uganda's National Anemia Policy recommend that pregnant women should receive a standard dose of 60 mg iron + 400 μg folic acid for at least 6 months; a total of (at minimum) 180 IFA tablets.

This policy recommendation is to prevent anemia and iron deficiency (not therapeutically), and 180 tablets would be needed from the start of the second pregnancy trimester to deliveryThe proportion of women receiving iron supplementation improved steadily over the past decade. The progress in the number of IFA pills consumed, however, has been slow. Studies have shown that the use of blister packs containing drugs significantly increased patients' compliance, compared with traditional means of dispensing drugs in a paper envelope.

No trials have been done to assess the effectiveness of blister packaging of Iron-Folic Acid (IFA) on adherence to treatment in low to middle income countries like Uganda. In this trial, we tested the hypothesis that dispensing blister packaged IFA to pregnant women in ANC increases the adherence compared to the loose pills.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

Definition of anemia and classification into subtypes of anemia

In accordance with the WHO criteria, anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration < 13.0 g/dL (8.0 mmol/L) in adult men and < 12.0 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) in adult, non-pregnant women. In anemic subjects older than 60 years of age additional biochemical tests were performed, using stored plasma, to determine the type of anemia: anemia due to nutritional deficiency, ACI or unexplained anemia. There is no worldwide accepted classification into subtypes of anemia. Reference values were taken from the University Medical Center Groningen or from published literature, as indicated. Iron deficiency was considered present if the participant had two or three of the following criteria: serum ferritin concentration < 30 μg/L, transferrin saturation rate < 16% or hepcidin concentration < 0.5 nmol/L. – Transferrin saturation was calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity [transferrin (g/L)×25]. Folate deficiency was defined as a serum folate level < 9.8 nmol/L. Vitamin B12 deficiency was defined as a serum methylmalonic acid concentration > 340 nmol/L, if the estimated glomerular filtration was > 30 mL/min (because methylmalonic acid levels may be elevated in people with severely impaired renal function). If there was no evidence of nutrient deficiency, subjects with anemia were evaluated for other causes. Subjects were classified as having anemia related to chronic renal disease if the estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 30 mL/min. The Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CDK-EPI) formula was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate. ACI was defined as present if the participant had (i) a C-reactive protein concentration > 5.0 mg/L or an absolute number of leukocytes > 10×10 9 /L and (ii) two or more of the following criteria: transferrin saturation rate < 16%, serum ferritin concentration > 100 μg/L, serum iron < 10 μmol/L and hepcidin > 14.7 nmol/L in men or hepcidin > 15.6 nmol/L in women. If subjects with anemia could not be classified into any of these categories, they were considered, by exclusion, to have unexplained anemia.

### Multivitamin (prenatol-M) [^114gwb6r]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings:

Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folate alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient.

Precautions:

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient's medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

For use on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1–877–921–7873 or FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

### Individual and contextual-level factors associated with iron-folic acid supplement intake during pregnancy in Ethiopia: a multi-level analysis [^116JEVd7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The global estimate indicated that nearly 42% of pregnant women and 30% of non-pregnant women are found to be anemic. In Sub-Sahara Africa, 20% of maternal mortality was directly attributed to anemia. According to 2016, Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, 24% of reproductive-age women were anemic. Anemia among reproductive-age women who reside in rural and urban areas was 25% and 17%, respectively. In several low-income countries, the cause of anemia during pregnancy is multi-factorial. It includes nutrition deficiencies of folate, vitamin B12, iron, and parasitic diseases such as malaria and hookworm.

Anemia develops as a result of ineffective or deficient erythropoiesis or loss of red blood cells and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of red blood cell morphology is types of anemia that have different biological mechanisms of causation. Iron in the human body is regulated by the iron cycle and most of the storage iron human body is used for new red blood cell (RBC) synthesis or erythropoiesis and the lack of iron stored in the body limits the erythropoiesis process which leads to a reduction in the number of circulating RBCs lower than normal and insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity to meet physiological demands subsequently results in the development of IDA. On the other hand, folate has a crucial role in the DNA synthesis pathway and the deficiency of folate or vitamin B12 affects DNA synthesis and cell division in the bone marrow (megaloblastic changes). This deficiency leads to nuclear division without significant alteration in the cytoplasmic maturation cycle and nucleated precursor cells in the bone marrow develop immature or morphologically abnormal nuclei and giant metamyelocytes, with macrocytic red blood cells called megaloblastic anemia.

Iron and folic acid deficiencies are the most common causes of anemia among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Iron deficiency anemia contributes to adverse effects on maternal and child health. The maternal consequences include: low weight gain, preterm labor, placenta previa, premature rupture of membrane, cardiac arrest, hemorrhage, lowered resistance to infection, poor cognitive development, and reduced work capacity. But, it is not limited to the above-mentioned effects. Similarly, it has fetal and neonatal risks including prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal distress, which contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Infants born to anemic women are more likely to become anemic. Folic acid (the synthetic form of Vitamin B9 or folate) deficiency at conception and in early pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of neural tube defect, preeclampsia, fetal malformations, and preterm delivery.
