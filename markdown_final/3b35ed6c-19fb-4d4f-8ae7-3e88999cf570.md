## Question

Ozempic initial dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the correct initial dose of Ozempic (semaglutide) and how to titrate it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved starting dose and whether it differs by indication. Then, I should verify the purpose of the initial low-dose phase and the pharmacologic rationale for escalation. Next, I will check the specific escalation schedules for diabetes versus obesity, making sure I distinguish Ozempic from Wegovy. After that, I need to review key administration instructions and safety checks, including what to do if a dose is missed. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, indication-specific answer with caveats for special populations and drug interactions, and confirm there are no exceptions that would change the starting dose.

> Let me first confirm the labeled starting dose across indications. For Ozempic in adults with type 2 diabetes, the FDA label instructs initiation at 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects, after which the dose is increased to 0.5 mg weekly and then further to 1 mg or 2 mg based on glycemic response, with a maximum of 2 mg weekly [^111iaJ3u] [^111nMv6W]. Hold on, I should verify that the same 0.25 mg start applies to cardiovascular-risk reduction and chronic kidney disease in T2D; yes, the provided FDA summaries also specify 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks followed by escalation, aligning with the core label for Ozempic [^112Cvzh8] [^111i1Uxh] [^117EyvNe].

> Wait, let me verify something important about obesity dosing because I initially thought "0.25 mg for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg, then 1 mg, then 1.7 mg, then 2.4 mg" applied to Ozempic. That is actually the Wegovy regimen, not Ozempic; I need to correct that. For obesity and weight management, semaglutide is marketed as Wegovy with a 16‑week titration to 2.4 mg weekly, whereas Ozempic is the diabetes formulation and does not carry an obesity indication; I almost conflated them, so I should explicitly state that the higher-dose, longer-titration schedule belongs to Wegovy, not Ozempic [^112aeyWU] [^116ufhz8].

> Next, I should review the rationale for starting low. The 0.25 mg weekly "run‑in" is intended to improve gastrointestinal tolerability by allowing time for adaptation to delayed gastric emptying and GLP‑1–mediated GI effects. I need to ensure this aligns with both pharmacodynamics and trial designs that escalated every 4 weeks. The label notes this strategy to reduce GI adverse reactions, and STEP protocols deliberately escalated at 4‑week intervals with options to pause if intolerance emerged, reinforcing the principle of slow titration to enhance adherence and continuation [^111iaJ3u] [^112Zwtm3] [^112hHGfV].

> I will now examine the escalation path for Ozempic in T2D. After 4 weeks at 0.25 mg, increase to 0.5 mg once weekly. If additional glycemic control is needed after at least 4 more weeks, increase to 1 mg once weekly. If still insufficient after at least 4 more weeks, increase to 2 mg once weekly, which is the maximum recommended dose for Ozempic. I should double-check that CKD guidance mirrors this: yes, it also starts at 0.25 mg for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg, with a typical maintenance target of 1 mg weekly in CKD, consistent with the label's glycemic-control algorithm [^111iaJ3u] [^111i1Uxh] [^117EyvNe].

> Let me consider administration details because they affect safety and efficacy. Ozempic is administered once weekly on the same day, any time of day, with or without meals, as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm; rotate sites within regions. If a dose is missed, administer as soon as possible within 5 days; if more than 5 days have passed, skip and resume the regular schedule. I should confirm the day‑change rule: the weekly day can be changed if at least 2 days (> 48 hours) elapse between doses. Also, never share pens, and when used with insulin, give separate injections not adjacent to each other [^111iaJ3u] [^116rsfpT].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and drug interactions that might modify practice even if they don't change the starting dose. No dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment, but I need to ensure vigilance for volume depletion and AKI in the setting of GI adverse effects. In older adults, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen, though greater sensitivity cannot be ruled out. With insulin or sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia risk increases, so consider reducing the secretagogue or insulin dose when initiating Ozempic and counsel on hypoglycemia recognition. I should also remember the retinopathy signal with rapid glycemic improvement and monitor patients with preexisting retinopathy more closely [^112m7ZMy] [^113N8Jgp] [^113MRgNj] [^112veycA] [^116rsfpT] [^117DprtW].

> But wait, what if someone asks for a quicker escalation because of urgency. The label anchors the initial 0.25 mg to 4 weeks to mitigate GI effects; while some oral semaglutide literature discusses earlier escalation in select scenarios, that pertains to Rybelsus and a different formulation and is not directly transferable to injectable Ozempic, so I should avoid extrapolating and stick to the approved weekly titration cadence for Ozempic unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring [^112PdKXe] [^111iaJ3u].

> Let me synthesize the final answer clearly. For Ozempic in adults with type 2 diabetes, the initial dose is 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by an increase to 0.5 mg once weekly, with further titration to 1 mg and then 2 mg as needed for glycemic control, not exceeding 2 mg weekly. This same 0.25 mg start applies when Ozempic is used for cardiovascular risk reduction or CKD indications in T2D, with maintenance typically at 0.5–1 mg weekly depending on context. For obesity, the 2.4 mg maintenance regimen with a 16‑week titration belongs to Wegovy, not Ozempic, so I should not apply the Wegovy schedule to Ozempic prescriptions [^111iaJ3u] [^111nMv6W] [^112Cvzh8] [^111i1Uxh] [^112aeyWU].

---

The initial dose of Ozempic (semaglutide) is **0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly** for the first 4 weeks [^111iaJ3u]. This starting dose is **not for glycemic control** but to improve gastrointestinal tolerability [^111iaJ3u]; after 4 weeks, increase to 0.5 mg once weekly, then titrate to 1 mg or 2 mg based on glycemic response and tolerability [^111iaJ3u]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment [^112m7ZMy], and the injection can be given at any time of day, with or without meals [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Initial dose and titration schedule

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks (weeks 1–4) [^111iaJ3u].
- **First escalation**: Increase to 0.5 mg once weekly after 4 weeks (week 5 onward) [^111iaJ3u].
- **Further titration**: If additional glycemic control is needed, increase to 1 mg once weekly after at least 4 weeks at 0.5 mg [^111iaJ3u].
- **Maximum dose**: 2 mg once weekly, considered if additional control is needed after at least 4 weeks at 1 mg [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Clinical rationale for initial dose

The 0.25 mg starting dose is intended to **reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [^1123BArJ] during initiation; after 4 weeks, the dose is increased to 0.5 mg to begin achieving glycemic control [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Administration instructions

- **Injection sites**: Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm; rotate sites weekly [^111iaJ3u].
- **Timing**: Any time of day, with or without meals [^111iaJ3u].
- **Missed dose**: If within 5 days, take as soon as possible; if more than 5 days, skip and resume the next scheduled dose [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Special populations

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^112m7ZMy].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^112veycA].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment, but monitor closely for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting initial dose

Clinical trials demonstrate that initiating at 0.25 mg weekly and titrating to 0.5–1 mg improves **glycemic control** and reduces **cardiovascular risk** [^113aiBrc], with manageable gastrointestinal adverse effects [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Ozempic dosing schedule

| **Week** | **Dose (mg)** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1–4 | 0.25 | Tolerability |
| 5–8 | 0.5 | Glycemic control |
| 9–12 | 1.0 | Enhanced control |
| 13–16 | 2.0 | Maximum control |

---

The initial dose of Ozempic is **0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks** to improve tolerability, followed by titration to 0.5 mg and then 1–2 mg based on glycemic response and tolerability [^111iaJ3u].

Fig. 1
Study design. a Not all visits are shown in the diagram. 1G first generation, 2A dose escalation visit (group 1: day 1), 2B dose escalation visit (group 1: day 8; group 2: day 1), 2G second generation, N planned number of participants (please refer to Results and Fig. 2 for the actual number of participants enrolled); PK pharmacokinetic

The four steady-state periods comprised a total duration of 20 weeks. For all groups, the 5-week steady-state periods started with a single on-site dose followed by self-administered once-daily home dosing. The half-life of semaglutide is approximately 1 week, therefore the participants were dosed daily for 5 weeks (corresponding to five half-lives) in each period to ensure evaluation of bioequivalence under SS conditions. A Test (T) and Reference (R) crossover design of TRTR/RTRT was used, whereby the two treatment arms within each group alternated between 2G oral semaglutide and 1G oral semaglutide (Fig. 1). Each steady-state period ended with a 24-h on-site PK sampling visit (visits 5, 7, 9 and 11) before proceeding to the next steady-state period (or follow-up). Participants arrived the day before the last dose in the 5-week period and stayed on-site overnight. The following morning, body weight was measured, and a pre-dose blood sample was taken before participants received the last dose of the 5-week period, and repeated blood sampling was subsequently performed over the next 24 h for the PK analyses supporting evaluation of the co-primary endpoints. Participants were instructed to fast overnight (≥ 6 h) prior to each dosing and before on-site visits; water intake was not allowed ≤ 2 h before dosing. During the 30 min post-dose, no intake of food, liquid or other oral medication was allowed. Initiation of breakfast meal was carried out 30–35 min post-dosing for both on-site and home dosing.

A follow-up visit was scheduled ≥ 5 weeks after administration of the last dose for safety assessments. The planned total duration of study participation for each participant was 177–217 days (Fig. 1), depending on the group.

It was aimed to have an even distribution of male and female participants with ≥ 40% of each sex recruited into each group.

Table 1
Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients

Overall, 937 (77.3%) patients were initiated on a 0.25 mg dose. The majority of GLP-1RA-naïve patients were prescribed a starting semaglutide dose of 0.25 mg, whereas approximately half of the patients in the GLP-1RA switcher group started on a 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg dose, compared with only about 16% of GLP-1RA-naïve patients (online supplemental tables 5–8). For the majority of patients (1020 (84.2%)), one of the reasons for initiating OW semaglutide was to improve glycemic control, with weight reduction as a secondary reason. The rationale for initiating semaglutide was broadly similar for both GLP-1RA-naïve patients and GLP-1RA switchers (table 1).

Overall, 941 (77.6%) patients were taking metformin at baseline, 499 (41.2%) were on an SGLT-2i and 421 (34.7%) on basal insulin. At baseline, 201 patients were on a DPP-4i, of which 131 switched to semaglutide and 70 had semaglutide added on to a DPP-4i (table 2). Medications at baseline for the other subgroups investigated are shown in online supplemental tables 5–8.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

2.2 Study protocol and titration schedule

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

### Semaglutide 2. 4 mg once weekly in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Dash_related cirrhosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^111TGyXp]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

In the phase 2 trial of semaglutide in patients with NASH and F1–3, a maximum dose of 0·4 mg once daily was investigated, which contrasts with the 2·4 mg once weekly schedule used in the current trial. Semaglutide 2·4 mg once weekly has been shown to be effective and well tolerated for weight reduction in patients with overweight or obesity, and therefore was considered appropriate for this trial given the high disease burden of participants, including BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or more. A once-weekly dosing schedule was also anticipated to be likely to improve the burden of drug administration compared with once-daily dosing. It was estimated that maximum plasma concentrations of semaglutide after once-weekly 2·4 mg doses would be similar to those achieved with 0·4 mg once daily (unpublished data).

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; p = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^1153SKGf]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aiBrc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^113AfdKZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) have recently gained momentum after the introduction of semaglutide, the first oral molecule in their class. In a recent article in this journal by Evans et al., a succinct overview of the utility of semaglutide is highlighted in the context of virtual diabetes care. To take this discussion further, this commentary describes the value and positioning of oral semaglutide in common clinical situations. Its insights assist in pragmatic placement of this drug in clinical practice. Special emphasis is laid on the use of oral semaglutide in persons already on injectable GLP-1RA formulations, those experiencing sudden changes in life style pattern due to religious, social, or professional commitments, individuals seeking help for urgent glycemic control, and those who face sudden change in their concomitant medications or comorbidities.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials, 744 (23.6%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 102 OZEMPIC-treated patients (3.2%) patients were 75 years of age and over. In SUSTAIN 6, the cardiovascular outcome trial, 788 (48%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 157 OZEMPIC-treated patients (9.6%) patients were 75 years of age and over.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including kidney failure, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Semaglutide (Ozempic® and Wegovy®) dose escalation — it is recommended to slowly increase the dose of semaglutide until you reach your goal dose. For Ozempic®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 6 weeks, then give 1 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next. For Wegovy®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1.7 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 2.4 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose and reduces body weight. All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mean 24-hour Plasma Glucose Profiles (standardized meals) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo

Insulin Secretion

Both first-and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with OZEMPIC compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo, fasting glucagon (8%), postprandial glucagon response (14 to 15%), and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration (12%).

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was similar to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate Versus Glucose Concentration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during Graded Glucose Infusion before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo and in Untreated Healthy Subjects

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady-state.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^111yd7at]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^1123BArJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

Combination with metformin or metformin with sulfonylurea

In a 30-week, open-label trial (NCT02128932), 1089 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg once weekly, OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly, or insulin glargine once daily on a background of metformin (48%) or metformin and sulfonylurea (51%). Patients had a mean age of 57 years and 53% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 8.6 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 77% were White, 9% were Black or African American, and 11% were Asian; 20% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Patients assigned to insulin glargine had a baseline mean HbA1c of 8.1% and were started on a dose of 10 U once daily. Insulin glargine dose adjustments occurred throughout the trial period based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose before breakfast, targeting 71 to < 100 mg/dL. In addition, investigators could titrate insulin glargine at their discretion between study visits. Only 26% of patients had been titrated to goal by the primary endpoint at week 30, at which time the mean daily insulin dose was 29 U per day.

### Dose-dependent erythema nodosum after initiation of semaglutide [^114RJYZp]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an acute septal panniculitis characterized by tender erythematous nodules primarily localized on extensor surfaces of the lower legs. EN is considered a hypersensitivity response to antigenic stimuli. The exact mechanism is disputed, with some authors postulating the pathogenesis as due to deposition of immune complexes in the venules of the septae of the subcutaneous fat, Though the etiology is typically idiopathic, it can occur with a vast number of underlying causes including streptococcal infections, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, and pregnancy. Medications that have been most commonly associated with EN include sulfonamides, bromides, and oral contraceptives, as well as a host of vaccines. Semaglutide (Ozempic) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and more recently, it has gained considerable popularity as a treatment for weight loss. Here we report a unique case of EN attributed to semaglutide.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a single center. We enrolled patients with T2DM who had been treated with OW semaglutide (Ozempic ® subcutaneous injection SD) in the Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center between June 2021 and December 2021. Semaglutide was used for better glycemic control at the discretion of the attending physician according to the Japanese package insert, with a starting dose of 0.25 mg. We evaluated clinical parameters 6 months after OW semaglutide initiation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Japanese patients with T2DM who initiated OW semaglutide in an outpatient setting. The exclusion criteria were patients with acute metabolic disorders, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome; who were taking steroids, had acute infectious disease, or had any newly diagnosed cancer; who required hospitalization, self-discontinued, or had poor adherence to injections; who exhibited a change in an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) or new insulin induction during the observation period; and whose adverse events led to discontinuation within 6 months.

6.2 Key clinical considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice

Currently, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbid condition.,

Figure 1 illustrates key considerations for the use of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should be initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every 4 weeks according to the dose‐escalation schedule in Figure 1, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached. This escalation schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs, but if a patient does not tolerate a dose during the escalation period, the subsequent escalation step can be delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re‐escalated to 2.4 mg. If needed, this re‐escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 more weeks) and the escalation can be stopped at a lower maintenance dose where AEs are tolerable. In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^11512Qa5]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, the first glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist available in tablet form for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were established in the phase 3a PIONEER program. However, evidence regarding the titration of oral semaglutide in real-world clinical settings remains insufficient. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic advantages of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg through clinical data analysis.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single center in Japan, focusing on adults with type 2 diabetes who were initiated on 14 mg oral semaglutide. The primary endpoint was the alteration in HbA1c levels 24 weeks after the initial prescription of 14 mg oral semaglutide. Secondary endpoints included changes in metabolic parameters and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Data from 66 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 24 weeks following dose escalation was - 0.5 ± 0.8% [from 7.4 ± 1.0% at baseline to 7.0 ± 0.9% at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)]. Moreover, a significant reduction in body weight of - 2.0 ± 4.4 kg was observed at 24 weeks [from 90.0 ± 20.5 kg at baseline to 88.2 ± 21.4 kg at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)], with 41% of patients achieving at least a 3% reduction compared to baseline. Gastrointestinal disorders emerged as the most prevalent adverse event (10.6%), particularly nausea (7.6%), although predominantly of mild or moderate severity, with no instances of serious adverse events necessitating drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg could be an effective approach for enhancing glycemic control and managing body weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Real-world use of once-weekly semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: pooled analysis of data from four SURE studies by baseline characteristic subgroups [^115Dss6G]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to an AE in the SURE studies (9.5%) was lower than was observed with OW semaglutide 1.0 mg in the SUSTAIN clinical trial program (≤ 15%). This highlights that OW semaglutide is well tolerated in real-world practice. This discontinuation rate was also lower than the rate observed in the retrospective observational SPARE study (17%), which included data from 937 GLP-1RA-naïve patients with T2D. This difference may be due to variations in dosing practices. In the SUSTAIN clinical trial program, patients were required to follow a clear dosing schedule during the study period; in contrast, in real-world practice, dosing schedules may differ depending on patient needs: to manage GI side effects, for example, the escalation strategy during initiation or maintenance dosing (which may include dose skipping) will be tailored to the individual. The initial recommended dose for semaglutide is 0.25 mg, before escalating to a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg after 4 weeks and to 1.0 mg after a further 4 weeks, if needed. However, in the SURE studies, approximately 77% of patients were initiated on a dose of 0.25 mg and, by EOS, the 576 (58.5%) patients remaining on treatment were receiving a 1.0 mg dose. While doses other than 0.5 and 1.0 mg/week are off-label, such doses were being used by 134 (14%) of patients still on treatment in the study (because of the non-interventional nature of the study), which is an indication that patients and physicians were tailoring the dose to individual requirements.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg compared with 14 mg in adults with type 2 diabetes (PIONEER PLUS): a multicentre, randomised, phase 3b trial [^1155p2iq]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Once-daily oral semaglutide is an effective type 2 diabetes treatment. We aimed to investigate a new formulation of oral semaglutide at higher investigational doses versus the approved 14 mg dose in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3b trial, carried out at 177 sites in 14 countries, enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) 8·0–10·5% (64–91 mmol/mol), a BMI of 25·0 kg/m 2 or greater, receiving stable daily doses of one to three oral glucose-lowering drugs. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1), by means of an interactive web response system, to once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg for 68 weeks. Investigators, site personnel, trial participants, and trial sponsor staff were masked to dose assignment throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52, evaluated with a treatment policy estimand in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of trial drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04707469, and the European Clinical Trials register, EudraCT 2020–000299–39, and is complete.

Findings

Between Jan 15 and Sept 29, 2021, of 2294 people screened, 1606 (n = 936 [58·3%] male; n = 670 [41·7%] female; mean [SD] age 58·2 [10·8] years) received oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 536), 25 mg (n = 535), or 50 mg (n = 535). At baseline, mean (SD) HbA 1c was 9·0% (0·8; 74·4 mmol/L [SD 8·3]) and mean bodyweight was 96·4 kg (21·6). Mean changes (SE) in HbA 1c at week 52 were -1·5 percentage points (SE 0·05) with oral semaglutide 14 mg, -1·8 percentage points (0·06) with 25 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·27, 95% CI -0·42 to -0·12; p = 0·0006), and -2·0 percentage points (0·06) with 50 mg (ETD -0·53, -0·68 to -0·38; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were reported by 404 (76%) participants in the oral semaglutide 14 mg group, 422 (79%) in the 25 mg group, and 428 (80%) in the 50 mg group. Gastrointestinal disorders, which were mostly mild to moderate, occurred more frequently with oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg than with 14 mg. Ten deaths occurred during the trial; none were judged to be treatment related.

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg were superior to 14 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. No new safety concerns were identified.

3.1.2 Subset with baseline clinical data

For patients with a measurement in the baseline period, mean weight was 104.9 kg (SD: 24.0; n = 689) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 36.2 kg/m 2 (SD: 7.6). Most patients met the criteria for obesity: 77.6% had a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or higher. Mean HbA1c was 8.4% (SD: 1.8%; n = 499); 112/499 patients (22.4%) had HbA1c less than 7% and 84/499 (16.8%) had HbA1c of 10% or higher. Mean time with T2D noted in the Explorys database, used to estimate approximate disease duration, was 6.9 years (SD: 4.8; Table 1).

3.2 Oral semaglutide dosing

The majority of patients had a first prescription that included the 3 mg dose: 404/782 (51.7%) had a first prescription for 3 mg alone, 112/782 (14.3%) had prescriptions for 3 and 7 mg, and 5/782 (0.6%) had prescriptions for 3, 7 and 14 mg. However, 201/782 patients (25.7%) had an initial prescription recorded for 7 mg alone, 41/782 (5.2%) had a prescription for 14 mg alone, and 8/782 (1.0%) had a prescription for both 7 and 14 mg. Overall, 289/782 patients (37.0%) were prescribed 3 mg as their highest dose, of whom 36/289 received their prescription during the last 6 weeks of the study period (1 November to 15 December 2020). Only 106/782 patients (13.6%) were prescribed the 14 mg dose.

Structure of semaglutide (subcutaneous formulation)

The SURPASS-2 trial compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, with those of semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg in patients with type 2 Diabetes over a period of 40 weeks. The overall mean duration of Diabetes was 8.6 years, the average body weight was 93.7 kg, and the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%. The final and mean points of reduction in body weight show that tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 7.6 kg, − 9.3 kg, and − 11.2 kg, respectively, compared to −5.7 kg for semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. Both drugs also decreased glycated haemoglobin levels. The reductions observed in glycated haemoglobin levels with tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 2.01% points, − 2.24% points, and − 2.30% points, respectively, compared to − 1.86% points with semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. These final results confirm the primary pharmacological effects of semaglutide.

However, Ozempic does not exhibit greater impact on gastric emptying. Semaglutide may also cause some side effects, the frequency of which is shown in Fig. 6.

Ozempic is available in injectable form. In the treatment of type 2 Diabetes, Ozempic is administered subcutaneously once a week at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, with an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week for the first 4 weeks. However, in the treatment of obesity, this drug is used in larger doses – 2.4 mg/week.

14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

OZEMPIC has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, metformin and sulfonylureas, metformin and/or thiazolidinedione, and basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of OZEMPIC was compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release (ER), and insulin glargine.

Most trials evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, and 1 mg, with the exception of the trial comparing OZEMPIC and exenatide ER where only the 1 mg dose was studied. One trial evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, OZEMPIC produced clinically relevant reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared with placebo.

The efficacy of OZEMPIC was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, diabetes duration and level of renal function impairment.

Monotherapy Use of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a 30-week double-blind trial (NCT02054897), 388 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with diet and exercise were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg or OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly or placebo. Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 54% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 4.2 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 64% were White, 8% were Black or African American, and 21% were Asian; 30% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^1136juMc]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This retrospective observational study, utilizing real-world clinical data, revealed the efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg. Our findings demonstrated that this dose escalation resulted in an additional improvement of − 0.5% in HbA1c levels and a reduction of − 2.0 kg in body weight, all achieved without encountering serious AEs. Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg may serve as an effective strategy for intensifying glycemic therapy and managing body weight in patients with T2D.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether OZEMPIC causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of OZEMPIC and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with OZEMPIC. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of OZEMPIC, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue OZEMPIC and initiate appropriate management.

### Semaglutide in obesity: unmet needs in men [^111onX3c]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal dose titration scheme helps to reduce AEs, and improve tolerability and adherence. A phase 2 dose-finding study for semaglutide in which 65% of the study population were men reported that slow dose escalation of semaglutide using 4-week dose escalation steps starting from an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week ameliorated AEs without compromising efficacy. A trial that included only a male population, which had the aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single escalating doses of semaglutide, identified the maximum tolerated single dose (MTSD) to be 15 μg/kg body weight, which was worked out to be 1.2 mg in a male subject weighing 80 kg. There were no serious AEs and no subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

Based on differences in exposure-response analysis between men and women, established MTSD and our clinical experience, we propose that a higher initial dose of semaglutide of 0.5 mg/week should be considered for men, especially those with BMI > 35 kg/m 2. In the event of good tolerability, a rapid titration scheme in general may then be used in men. Since the response on weight reduction in men seems to be delayed in comparison to that in women, we also advise to delay the efficacy assessment in men to later than 3 months after treatment initiation. It would be of specific clinical interest to design randomized controlled trails to address these issues.

Randomisation and masking

Randomisation was done centrally using an interactive web response system and stratified for presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. Calyx (formerly Parexel) generated the randomisation list. Randomisation was done in a 2:1 ratio to the semaglutide or placebo group with a block size of six; patients were assigned to the next available treatment according to a randomisation schedule. Patients, investigators, trial site staff, and the sponsor (except for specific laboratory staff and individuals responsible for safety) remained blinded to treatment assignment throughout the trial. Semaglutide and placebo injections were visually identical — ie, used the same syringes and volume of injection, etc — to preserve blinding.

Procedures

Patients assigned to the semaglutide group received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide and those assigned to the placebo group received once-weekly, subcutaneous placebo for 48 weeks with a 7-week follow-up. Semaglutide was escalated from an initial dose of 0·24 mg to 0·5 mg after 4 weeks, and thereafter every 4 weeks to 1·0 mg, 1·7 mg, and finally 2·4 mg once weekly after 16 weeks' treatment (appendix p 4). Dietary and lifestyle advice was given as standard of care according to local standards. During dose escalation, patients could remain at their existing level for up to 1 additional week for tolerability (eg, gastrointestinal events) or other reasons, as judged by the investigator. Patients were removed from the trial if any of the following criteria were met: simultaneous participation in another clinical trial, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or medullary thyroid carcinoma, surgical treatment for obesity, or events of hepatic decompensation (eg ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89%. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure is achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. Steady-state exposure is achieved following 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean population-PK estimated steady-state concentrations following once weekly subcutaneous administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 65 ng/mL and 123 ng/mL, respectively. In the trial comparing semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg, the mean steady state concentrations were 111.1 ng/mL and 222.1 ng/mL, respectively.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 12.5L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%).

Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Inspect OZEMPIC visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless. Do not use OZEMPIC if particulate matter and coloration is seen.
Administer OZEMPIC once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of the day, with or without meals.
Inject OZEMPIC subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Instruct patients to use a different injection site each week when injecting in the same body region.
When using OZEMPIC with insulin, instruct patients to administer as separate injections and to never mix the products. It is acceptable to inject OZEMPIC and insulin in the same body region, but the injections should not be adjacent to each other.
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the time between two doses is at least 2 days (> 48 hours).
If a dose is missed, administer OZEMPIC as soon as possible within 5 days after the missed dose. If more than 5 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Recommended Initiation Dosage

Initiate OZEMPIC with a dosage of 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks. Follow the dosage escalation below to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After 4 weeks on the 0.25 mg dosage, increase the dosage to 0.5 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance and Maximum Dosages for Glycemic Control

The recommended maintenance dosage is 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg, injected subcutaneously once weekly, based on glycemic control.

If additional glycemic control is needed after at least 4 weeks on the:

0.5 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 1 mg once weekly.
1 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 2 mg once weekly.

The maximum recommended dosage is 2 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Increase the dosage to the maintenance dosage, 1 mg once weekly, after at least 4 weeks on the 0.5 mg dosage.

Study Population

Inclusion criteria included: ≥ 1 pharmacy claim for any dose of T2D-indicated tirzepatide (Mounjaro® only) or injectable semaglutide (Ozempic® only) (index medications; hereafter referred to as tirzepatide and semaglutide) between May 13, 2022, and May 29, 2023, with the date of the first claim serving as the index date. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old on the index date and had ≥ 2 medical claims with a diagnosis of T2D (ICD-10-CM E11.xx), in any position, in any place of service, at any time prior to the index date, going back to January 1, 2016. Patients were required to have continuous enrollment in medical and pharmacy benefits during the six-month pre-index period and the 12-month post-index period. Exclusion criteria included any diagnosis in medical claims for gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes during the 6-month pre-index period, any claims related to bariatric surgery or other obesity-related procedures from January 1, 2016, through 12 months post-index, and patients with pregnancy, labor, or delivery claims from 6 months pre-index to 12 months post-index.

Eligible patients were first stratified according to their index medication, either tirzepatide or semaglutide, excluding anyone prescribed both on the index date. Further stratification was based on prior use of GLP-1 RAs indicated for T2D during the 6-month pre-index period. Those with no previous fills within the 6-month pre-index period were categorized as GLP-1 RA naïve, while those with ≥ 1 fill for a non-index GLP-1 RA were categorized as GLP-1 RA non-naïve. No patients were prescribed tirzepatide during the 6-month pre-index period, as it had not yet been approved for T2D at that time. The study compared GLP-1 RA naïve (henceforth referred to as naïve) patients initiating tirzepatide to those initiating semaglutide, as well as GLP-1 RA non-naïve (henceforth referred to as non-naïve) patients initiating tirzepatide to those initiating semaglutide. No statistical comparisons between the GLP-1 naïve and GLP-1 non-naïve cohorts were conducted.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### A bioequivalence study of two formulations of oral semaglutide in healthy participants [^114ZZfqq]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sustained glycaemic control and weight loss are key targets for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with current guidelines recommending a patient-centred approach for treatment selection. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) deliver effective glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, while increasing satiety, reducing body weight and blood pressure and improving cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that was initially approved as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection (Ozempic ®, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) for treating T2D. An initial oral formulation of semaglutide was subsequently developed as the first once-daily orally available GLP-1 analogue, using novel constituents to obtain oral bioavailability with the additional benefits of convenience and non-invasive administration. The Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) phase 3 programme demonstrated the efficacy of oral semaglutide versus placebo and active comparators (including empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide) in achieving glycaemic control and weight loss, with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1RA drug class. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus ®) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval in 2019 and 2020, respectively, for the second-line treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled T2D to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise at the once-daily oral doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg. In 2023, the FDA approved a label update for oral semaglutide allowing use as a first-line treatment option for adults with T2D.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^112e2sid]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In total, 34% of patients had no prescription for the 3 mg starting dose. This could be attributable to switching from another GLP‐1 RA, which permits initiation at a higher dose, or to patients receiving oral semaglutide samples, which were not captured in this dataset. The latter possibility would cause underestimation of changes in HbA1c from baseline because initiation of oral semaglutide for these patients would be earlier than the recorded index date. It is also notable that HbA1c reductions were observed, even though 26.1% of this cohort did not have a dose escalation beyond the initial 3 mg dose, indicating that further improvements might be achieved with escalation to the highest recommended dose of 14 mg. This is supported by the results of the PIONEER 7 trial, a flexible dosing study comparing oral semaglutide with sitagliptin 100 mg. All patients initiated the 3 mg dose of oral semaglutide, with the potential for dose adjustment to 7 or 14 mg at subsequent eight‐weekly intervals, based on HbA1c and gastrointestinal tolerability. Overall, 59% of patients on oral semaglutide at week 52 were receiving the 14 mg dose, 30% were receiving 7 mg and only 9% were receiving 3 mg. Overall, mean HbA1c reduction in the oral semaglutide group at this time point was −1.3% (standard error [SE]: 0.1) for the treatment policy estimand and −1.4% (SE: 0.1) for the trial product estimand. Although it is not possible to gather comprehensive information on the rationale underlying clinical decision‐making in a retrospective study, the fact that some patients in the current study received prescriptions only for the 3 mg initial dose may indicate an opportunity for education on dose escalation in the clinical care setting. Finally, the higher HbA1c reductions observed for patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels are consistent with data from the PIONEER programme highlighting the glycaemic benefit of oral semaglutide against comparators, across the full range of baseline HbA1c.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

Safety Outcomes

Throughout the study period, AEs were reported in 18 of 66 patients (27.3%) (Table 3). The predominant AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (10.6%), with nausea being the most commonly reported symptom (7.6%). However, most of these events were mild or moderate in severity. Notably, only one patient (1.5%) required a dose reduction of oral semaglutide due to gastrointestinal disorders. Other reasons for discontinuation or dose reduction included perceived treatment ineffectiveness by the attending physician, financial constraints, and patient requests. Additionally, a single instance (1.5%) of blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemia (54 mg/dL) was observed, with no serious AEs.

Summary of adverse events

Data are presented as n (%)

Subgroup Analysis

The median duration of the escalation of the oral semaglutide dose from 3 to 14 mg was 114 days. In the subgroup analysis, significant improvements in HbA1c levels were evident in both the early (< 114 days) and late dose-titration groups (≥ 114 days) (Supplementary Material, Table S2). However, notable weight loss was observed in the early dose-titration group. Conversely, gastrointestinal tract disorders were more prevalent in the early dose-titration group (Supplementary Material, Table S3).

### Semaglutide s.C. once-weekly in type 2 diabetes: a population pharmacokinetic analysis [^113pYFNZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is of increasing global concern. Since 1980, the population of adults with diabetes has quadrupled worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence of diabetes has increased, and no single country has managed to see a reduction in this prevalence. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common type of diabetes, making up approximately 90% of the total number of patients with diabetes in high-income countries, with an estimated 415 million adults with diabetes worldwide in 2015.

T2DM is linked to a range of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), microvascular complications, and cancer. Patients with T2DM have twice the risk of CVD mortality compared with age-matched subjects without T2DM, approximately 10% increased risk of cancer, and poorer survival rates of cancer. As the number of comorbidities a patient suffers from and the number of medications a patient is prescribed increase, his or her perceived quality of life decreases. There are many available treatments, but there is still a need for more effective treatments for T2DM.

Semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic ®) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2DM. Native human GLP-1 functions in a glucose-dependent manner, increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in the presence of elevated blood glucose. GLP-1 also decreases appetite and energy intake. However, endogenous GLP-1 has a short half-life (t ½ = 2–3 min) and is therefore not well suited for the treatment of T2DM. Semaglutide retains 94% amino acid homology with native GLP-1, allowing it to retain GLP-1 signaling functionality but with a half-life of about 1 week. This allows for subcutaneous injection once weekly.

The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) phase III trials have shown that semaglutide has a strong glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c)-lowering effect in patients with T2DM when injected subcutaneously once weekly. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), treatment with semaglutide causes a reduction in body weight. Globally conducted clinical trials have shown that semaglutide can provide superior glycemic control and body weight loss compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release or insulin glargine and compared with additional oral anti-diabetic drugs investigated in a dedicated Japanese trial. In addition, semaglutide has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure, and no cardiovascular risk was demonstrated.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus once-daily sitagliptin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes in SUSTAIN China: a 30-week, double-blind, phase 3a, randomized trial [^116kiH43]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The most recent guidelines and position statements issued in collaboration by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, 8 as well as guidelines from the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS), 7 emphasize an individually tailored choice of glucose‐lowering treatment for managing T2D. Besides optimizing glycaemic control, several other factors influence treatment choice, including the effect on weight, risk of hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular status. Currently, the CDS recommends the addition of glucose‐lowering agents, including glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, after first‐line metformin treatment and lifestyle modification in patients with T2D.

Semaglutide is a once‐weekly long‐acting GLP‐1 RA approved for the treatment of T2D under the trade name Ozempic ®. The GLP‐1 moiety of semaglutide is modified by the addition of a fatty diacid chain and two amino acid substitutions. These modifications prolong its half‐life through enhanced binding to albumin and inhibition of degradation by DPP‐4, facilitating once‐weekly dosing. 18 The efficacy and safety of semaglutide have been established in more than 10 000 patients in the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme. Semaglutide has consistently shown superior reductions in HbA 1c and body weight versus placebo and a range of active comparators such as sitagliptin, exenatide extended release, insulin glargine, dulaglutide, canagliflozin and liraglutide. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Furthermore, semaglutide was also associated with a significant 26% reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo in a preapproval cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT). 30

### Long-acting PYYanalogue with semaglutide for obesity: from preclinical assessment through randomized clinical studies [^1139h88M]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Part 2 was a 48‐week, four‐armed, double‐blinded (within dose level), randomized, placebo‐controlled, multicenter (13 sites in the US), proof‐of‐principle study comparing once‐weekly PYY1875 versus placebo as an add‐on to open‐label, once‐weekly semaglutide (s.c. 2.4 mg). Part 2 consisted of part 2a and part 2b. Part 2a was an open‐label run‐in in which all participants were treated with once‐weekly semaglutide (s.c. 2.4 mg at steady state) for 32 weeks, including an 8‐week escalation period.

Part 2b was the main study period, which took place during weeks 32 to 48, with week 32 considered baseline and week 48 end of treatment (EOT). In this period, all participants were randomized 2:1 to one of two once‐weekly PYY1875 doses (1.0/2.0 mg) or placebo as an add‐on to the ongoing semaglutide (s.c. 2.4 mg). The first 12 participants (across three sites) were allocated to the 2.0‐mg dose (2:1, PYY1875:placebo), and the rest were allocated to the 1.0‐mg dose (also 2:1, PYY1875:placebo). Participants were randomized using an interactive web response system and assigned to the next available treatment according to the randomization schedule. The 1.0‐mg PYY1875 dose was assessed for efficacy and safety whereas the 2.0‐mg dose was only assessed for safety. PYY1875 or placebo was escalated at 2‐week intervals over 8 or 10 weeks to 1.0‐mg or 2.0‐mg PYY1875, respectively. This was followed by 8 (1.0 mg) or 6 (2.0 mg) weeks of maintenance dose. Total study duration of part 2 was 58 weeks: 2 weeks of screening, 32 weeks of semaglutide run‐in, 16 weeks of PYY1875 or placebo as an add‐on to semaglutide, and 8 weeks of follow‐up with end of study (EOS) at week 56.

Dulaglutide

Dulaglutide (Trulicity) is administered subcutaneously at a maximum dose of 1.5 mg once weekly, and available on license since 2014 for people with T2D as monotherapy in those who cannot take metformin or as add-on treatment in people using oral agents and/or insulin. As monotherapy the use of dulaglutide in people with T2D has been reported to increase weight loss by up to 2.3 kg

Semaglutide

Semaglutide (Ozempic) is the most recent GLP-1 analogue to be approved for use in T2D and is currently available by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of T2D at a dose of up to 1.0 mg once weekly. It is licensed for use as monotherapy in those unable to take metformin or as add-on treatment. The absolute weight loss associated with semaglutide use is up to 4.6 kg and 6.5 kg at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg respectively over 40 weeks. Indeed, comparative trials have shown that semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated greater weight loss efficacy than dulaglutide 1.5 mg (6.5 kg vs. 3.0 kg). Indeed, a phase II dose-finding trial demonstrated greater body weight reductions associated with daily subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose greater than 0.2 mg compared with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily. The development of oral semaglutide for T2D and/or obesity is of interest, as other GLP-1 analogues are currently available only as injectables often limiting their use. One trial recently reported that oral semaglutide (14 mg once daily) resulted in greater weight loss compared with subcutaneous liraglutide (4.4 kg vs. 3.1 kg) over 26 weeks. Whilst the FDA approved the use of oral semaglutide for the treatment of people with T2D in September 2019, the EMA have not approved its use in T2D at the time of writing.

The effect of currently approved GLP-1 monotherapies for T2D on weight loss are presented in Table 2.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^115FEDCd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Treatment guidelines for T2D highlight the need for an individualized approach, and in clinical practice doses of therapeutic agents are frequently adjusted to achieve optimum results. The main phase of the PIONEER 7 study demonstrated that oral semaglutide dosing can be individualized, and that it is able to provide greater benefits to patients than sitagliptin. This long-term, open-label extension builds on these results, with the durability part representing the longest follow-up reported to date for oral semaglutide. Continued flexible dosing of oral semaglutide maintained reductions in HbA 1c and rates of achievement of HbA 1c goals, and resulted in further reductions in body weight over 104 weeks, while remaining well tolerated with no new safety signals. As expected for a GLP-1RA, and consistent with other trials from the PIONEER program, gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported AEs with oral semaglutide and the AEs that most often resulted in premature discontinuation. However, the majority of these AEs occurred in the early part of the main phase, and only one patient discontinued due to an AE in the second year of the durability part, indicating that discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs with oral semaglutide are likely to occur early on in treatment (during the initial dose-escalation phase) and not with long-term use.

### Once-weekly semaglutide versus placebo in adults with increased fracture risk: a randomised, double-blinded, two-centre, phase 2 trial [^116tgFiu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Participants allocated to the semaglutide group received semaglutide once-weekly subcutaneously, and those allocated to the placebo group received placebo (saline) once-weekly subcutaneously for 52 weeks. Semaglutide doses used for this study corresponded to doses used to treat T2D. Dosages were escalated from an initial dose of 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg after 4 weeks, and from 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg after another four weeks. At any timepoint, dosage could be reduced to the highest tolerable dose in case of intolerable side effects. The final dosage was administrated no later than six days before end-of study measurements were done.

To assess participant eligibility, a screening visit was done to obtain health information, such as medical history, height, weight, and HbA 1c, and to perform dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. For those eligible, a baseline visit was scheduled where participants met in a fasting state between 8 and 10 a.m, had blood samples taken, underwent high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scans and microindentation by OsteoProbe®, and were randomised. Another five on-site visits were scheduled after 4, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks, respectively. At these visits, blood samples were collected in the morning after an overnight fast, and vital signs including pulse and blood pressure were measured or reported by the participant in case of home measurement. Weight was measured after 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks, respectively. HbA 1c was measured after 26, 39, and 52 weeks. At last visit, follow-up tests including DXA scans, height, weight, HR-pQCT scans, and microindentation were performed for all participants. A total of 21 participants underwent transiliac bone biopsy following tetracycline labelling as described below at last visit. An end-of-trial follow-up phone call for safety assessments was scheduled six weeks after last visit (week 52).

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^112fxQmt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and showed significant benefits in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus active comparators in the PIONEER phase 3a randomized controlled trial programme. In this retrospective study, we present early data on the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, from the US IBM Explorys electronic health record database. In 782 patients prescribed oral semaglutide, 54.5% were women, and the mean age (SD) was 57.8years (11.3); 66.0% of patients received their prescription from a primary care practitioner. Although prescribing information recommends increasing the dose to 7 mg after 30days, 37.0% of patients received a prescription only for the initial 3 mg dose. Mean body mass index was 36.2 kg/m 2 (7.6); mean HbA1c was 8.4% (1.8%). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to approximately 6 months after oral semaglutide initiation was -0.9% (95% CI: -1.1%; -0.6%), with greater reductions in patients with higher baseline HbA1c. These data indicate prevalent early adoption of oral semaglutide in primary care, show real-world improvements in glycaemic control, and identify potential treatment gaps.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^116NgSF6]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Avoiding clinical inertia and early intensification of diabetes therapy have been emphasized as crucial for achieving HbA1c goals. In the present study, both the early and late dose-titration groups showed significant glycemic improvement, whereas only the early dose-titration group showed significant improvement in weight loss. However, the relatively short median time required for dose titration (114 days) suggests that the early dose-titration group may have been more likely to benefit from the weight loss associated with oral semaglutide initiation.

This study had some limitations. First, being a retrospective observational study conducted at a single center using historical data, the study is susceptible to confounding factors and biases. These factors may impact the results, posing challenges in ascertaining the true effects of the intervention. Additionally, it is a single-arm study without a comparator group, which limits its ability to draw direct comparisons. Although the patients were not stratified on the basis of concomitant medications, prior investigations have indicated that oral semaglutide is effective in reducing HbA1c levels and body weight, regardless of concurrent glucose-lowering agents. Additionally, the constant number of glucose-lowering medications throughout the study period and the predominant reduction in the total daily insulin dose suggested a minimal likelihood of overestimating the effect of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide, validating the obtained results. However, given the potentially heightened effects of 14 mg oral semaglutide in Asian populations, further verification is necessary to ascertain the applicability of these results to other racial groups. AEs may have been underestimated owing to inaccurate or selective records; however, it is noteworthy that no serious AEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation were missed owing to accurate prescription records. Second, the relatively small number of enrolled patients, although all patients prescribed 14 mg of oral semaglutide were included at the time of study planning, is a limitation. In particular, blood pressure and UACR assessments were challenging because they were often omitted or not measured. Further validation of the effects on blood pressure and UACR requires the inclusion of more cases. Third, two patients were lost to follow-up at the end of the 12-week visit as a result of hospital transfer and did not complete the full 24-week duration. Additionally, we excluded non-adherent patients, and data subsequent to the reduction or discontinuation of oral semaglutide during the observation period were not included in outcome measurements, which could introduce bias. Exclusion of non-adherent patients could lead to underreporting of adverse effects. However, only one patient was excluded because of non-adherence in this study. The patient initially switched from another GLP-1 receptor agonist to oral semaglutide but often took it after meals instead of on an empty stomach or forgot to take it altogether because of a busy morning schedule. They subsequently switched to injectable semaglutide and tolerated the maximum dosage without adverse effects, suggesting that proper oral administration would unlikely have led to adverse effects.

Trial procedures

The metformin dose at inclusion (as prescribed by the primary care physician) was maintained throughout the study. After a screening visit, participants wore a Libre Pro sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care) for continuous glucose monitoring for 2 weeks. This was followed by a first study visit for baseline measurements, including an OGTT with venous blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingesting 75 g of glucose. At the end of this visit, the participants were randomized to receive either semaglutide (Ozempic, Novo Nordisk) or dapagliflozin (Forxiga, AstraZeneca) in addition to metformin (Extended Data Fig. 1). Three months after randomization, the participants attended a visit for measurement of HbA1c and safety variables and application of another glucose sensor to wear for 2 weeks. Six months after randomization, they attended a final study visit for measurement of primary and secondary variables, including an OGTT. Participants who discontinued before the scheduled 6-month visit were invited to attend an immediate final visit before suspending their study medication.

Semaglutide was injected at a dose of 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly during the first 4 weeks, followed by 0.5 mg weekly for the subsequent 4 weeks and, finally, 1.0 mg weekly throughout the trial (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). A dose reduction to 0.5 mg was allowed if the participant experienced unacceptable side effects at 1.0 mg. Those randomized to dapagliflozin treatment received 10 mg orally once daily (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). Participants on semaglutide were instructed to adjust the administration schedule such that the last dose was taken 3 days before their final visit to standardize administration in relation to the final OGTT. In parallel, participants on dapagliflozin were instructed to take their tablet in the evening at least 3 days before their final visit, including the evening before the visit. These considerations were based on the pharmacokinetics and routes of administration of the study drugs to provide an average steady-state condition for both drugs before the OGTT.

In a Phase II dose‐finding trial, oral semaglutide at doses of 2.5‐40 mg once daily demonstrated significant dose‐dependent reductions in glucose and body weight in patients with early T2D. 34 Oral semaglutide was well tolerated, and the main adverse events were GI‐related, which (in common with other GLP‐1RAs) mainly consisted of dose‐dependent, mild‐to‐moderate and transient nausea when initiating or titrating therapy. Fewer GI events were reported when patients started on a lower dose, suggesting that a gradual escalation could be a helpful mitigation strategy. 34 Based on the results of the Phase II trial, 34 oral semaglutide doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg were taken forward to the Phase 3 Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme, a series of 10 multicentre, randomized clinical trials.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.5-, 3-, and 8-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 3X human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.3-, 2-, and 4-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 2X human exposure).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats, however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for OZEMPIC and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OZEMPIC or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In lactating rats, semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3- to 12- fold lower than in maternal plasma.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Discontinue OZEMPIC in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of OZEMPIC have not been established in pediatric patients.

5.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications

In a 2-year trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients treated with OZEMPIC (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (OZEMPIC 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (OZEMPIC 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.4 Never Share an OZEMPIC Pen Between Patients

OZEMPIC pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to OZEMPIC that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of OZEMPIC.

Properties and applications of semaglutide

The primary indication of semaglutide is type 2 diabetes. Currently, it is used as medication for adults who are obese or overweight, provided they have at least one weight-related comorbidity (for instance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol).

Semaglutide, as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, increases the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Addictionally, it supress glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells. It also contributes to a reduction in hunger and food cravings, and stimulates the satiety center in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing a feeling of fullness. It causes weight loss by reduced energy intake with minimal effects on energy expenditure.

Semaglutide is available in two forms: oral and injectable (under the skin fold). The structure of semaglutide in the subcutaneous formulation is presented in Fig. 5. Oral tablets of Ozempic are often administered once a day at doses of 7 mg and 14 mg, with an initial dose of 3 mg once a day for the first 30 days. Oral absorption of semaglutide is considerably faster than subcutaneous administration. However, other oral drugs should be administrated 30 min after swallowing the semaglutide tablet as they can disturb the absorption process. The elimination of this medication is very similar for both the oral and injectable form.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Oral Medications: OZEMPIC delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution (7.2).

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

OZEMPIC stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.

When initiating OZEMPIC, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)].

7.2 Oral Medications

OZEMPIC causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with OZEMPIC.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

Results

Search engine monitoring generated 1080 hyperlinks, with 317 (29.35%) for online pharmacies. Nearly one-half (134 sites [42.27%]) belonged to illegal pharmacy operations; 763 links were websites not offering products for sale, including 615 news and informational websites and 148 telemedicine websites requiring consultation to obtain prescription before purchase.

Six online vendors classified as not recommended or rogue by LegitScript and/or National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and offering parenteral semaglutide products were included in test buys. Three websites offered prefilled 0.25-mg per dose semaglutide injection pens, and 3 sold vials of lyophilized semaglutide to be reconstituted to solution for injection (1–3 mg). All vendors referred to weight loss and obesity on their product page. Prices for the smallest dose and quantity ranged from US $113 to $360 (mean [SD], US $218.5 [$93.6]) (Table).

Online Vendor Characteristics and Semaglutide Products Offered Online

Abbreviations: ACH, Automated Clearing House; NA, not applicable; NABP, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy; NR, not recommended.

Test purchases were confirmed via email and WhatsApp. Of 6 products purchased, only 3 were received. Three vendors selling Ozempic injections engaged in nondelivery scams requesting extra payments (range, US $650-$1200) to purportedly clear customs, confirmed as fraudulent by customs agencies. Although genuine Ozempic scored the full 22 points on the FIP checklist, test purchased products scored 8 or 9 with clear discrepancies in regulatory registration information, accurate labeling, and evidence products were likely unregistered or unlicensed.

Upon quality testing, one sample had elevated presence of endotoxin (8.95 EU/mg) indicating possible contamination, although no viable microorganisms were detected. LC-MS revealed the presence of semaglutide in all samples, but with considerably lower purity levels (7%-14% vs advertised 99%). The measured semaglutide content substantially exceeded the labeled amount in each sample by 29% to 39%, meaning that users could receive up to 39% more semaglutide per injection. These risk factors indicate likely falsification that does not meet legitimate product quality standards.

Table 7. Results at Week 40 in a Trial of OZEMPIC 2 mg Compared to OZEMPIC 1 mg in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Combination With Metformin or Metformin with Sulfonylurea

a The intent-to-treat population includes all randomized subjects. At week 40 the primary HbA1c endpoint was missing for 3% and 5% of patients randomized to OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg, respectively. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation based on retrieved dropouts. For calculation of proportions, imputed values are dichotomized and the denominator is the number of all randomized subjects.
b Intent-to-treat analysis using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline value and stratification factor.
cp < 0.01 (2-sided) for superiority, adjusted for multiplicity.

The mean baseline body weight was 98.6 kg and 100.1 kg in the OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg arms, respectively. The mean changes from baseline to week 40 were -5.6 kg and -6.4 kg in the OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg arms, respectively. The difference between treatment arms in body weight change from baseline at week 40 was not statistically significant.

Combination with basal insulin

In a 30-week, double-blind trial (NCT02305381), 397 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with basal insulin, with or without metformin, were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg once weekly, OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly, or placebo. Patients with HbA1c ≤ 8.0% at screening reduced their insulin dose by 20% at start of the trial to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients had a mean age of 59 years and 56% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 13 years, and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m2. Overall, 78% were White, 5% were Black or African American, and 17% were Asian; 12% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.
