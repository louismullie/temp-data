## Question

A 2-year-old girl with recurrent UTIs has bilateral renal pelvis dilation and retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition; kidney histology is requested.

A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?

Answer Choices:
A. Glomerular crescents with macrophages
B. Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation
C. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy
D. Thickened glomerular capillary loops

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which histologic finding is most likely in a 2-year-old girl with recurrent UTIs, bilateral renal pelvis dilation, and VCUG-demonstrated retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits vesicoureteral reflux with reflux nephropathy. Then, I should verify the expected chronic histopathology in reflux nephropathy. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that pathophysiology. Finally, I will confirm the best-supported option and note any nuances or exceptions I need to keep in mind.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome. Bilateral renal pelvis dilation with retrograde contrast into the ureters during micturition is classic for vesicoureteral reflux, and recurrent UTIs in this setting raise concern for reflux nephropathy with chronic parenchymal scarring, which is a well-described sequela of VUR-related pyelonephritis in children [^7901463b].

> Now, I need to think about the chronic histopathology. Reflux nephropathy evolves from repeated infections and back-pressure injury into chronic tubulointerstitial scarring with cortical thinning and tubular atrophy; this pattern is repeatedly emphasized in descriptions of chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease and is the expected endpoint in longstanding reflux nephropathy, even when glomeruli may show secondary sclerosis later on [^442dc698] [^ac4e318c].

> Wait, let me verify each option against that framework. Option A, glomerular crescents with macrophages, reflects rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, not the chronic, scarring pattern of reflux nephropathy; crescents are proliferative, inflammatory lesions and would be atypical for the chronic VUR sequelae described here [^aa2cedab]. Option B, matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation, is characteristic of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritides such as IgA nephropathy or IgM nephropathy, not the chronic tubulointerstitial scarring of reflux nephropathy, so this would be misleading in this context [^69793e3b]. Option D, thickened glomerular capillary loops, points toward membranous nephropathy or membranoproliferative patterns, again not the chronic tubulointerstitial scarring expected from reflux nephropathy [^82538b50]. Option C, cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, aligns with the chronic tubulointerstitial injury and cortical loss seen in reflux nephropathy and is the most consistent choice here [^442dc698].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any of the distractors could plausibly coexist. In longstanding reflux nephropathy, secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can occur, but the question asks for the most likely and characteristic finding; even then, the primary chronic lesion remains tubulointerstitial scarring with cortical thinning and tubular atrophy, not crescents, mesangial proliferation, or capillary wall thickening, reinforcing that C is the best answer [^442dc698] [^ac4e318c].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking a pediatric nuance. The child's age fits the epidemiology of VUR and reflux nephropathy, and the imaging sequence (US showing dilation, VCUG showing reflux) is the standard diagnostic pathway; nothing here suggests an alternative glomerular disease as the primary process, which strengthens the case for chronic tubulointerstitial scarring as the dominant biopsy finding if a kidney biopsy were performed in this scenario [^7901463b].

> Final answer: C. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, because this is the expected chronic histopathology of reflux nephropathy from recurrent UTIs with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by tubulointerstitial scarring and cortical loss rather than primary glomerular inflammatory patterns [^442dc698] [^ac4e318c].

The most likely histologic finding in a 2-year-old girl with recurrent UTIs, bilateral renal pelvis dilation, and VCUG showing retrograde contrast into the ureters is **cortical thinning with tubular atrophy** [^notfound], reflecting chronic reflux nephropathy from vesicoureteral reflux. This pattern reflects **chronic reflux nephropathy** from vesicoureteral reflux, with cortical thinning, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis as hallmark features [^notfound]. Glomerular crescents, mesangial proliferation, and thickened capillary loops are not typical of reflux nephropathy and would suggest other glomerular diseases [^notfound].

---

## Histopathological features of reflux nephropathy

Reflux nephropathy is characterized by **chronic tubulointerstitial injury** resulting from repeated episodes of reflux and infection. The key histological features include:

- **Cortical thinning**: Due to chronic parenchymal loss and scarring.
- **Tubular atrophy**: Loss of tubular epithelial cells and dilated, atrophic tubules.
- **Interstitial fibrosis**: Replacement of normal renal parenchyma with fibrous tissue.
- **Glomerulosclerosis**: Secondary to chronic tubulointerstitial injury, but not the primary feature.
- **Chronic inflammatory infiltrate**: Lymphocytes and macrophages in the interstitium.

These findings are consistent with chronic **tubulointerstitial nephritis** secondary to reflux and infection, rather than primary glomerular diseases [^notfound].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Histological finding** | **Relevance to reflux nephropathy** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Glomerular crescents with macrophages | Not typical; suggests rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [^aa2cedab] |
| B | Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation | Not typical; suggests mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [^69793e3b] |
| C | Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy | Typical of reflux nephropathy [^notfound] |
| D | Thickened glomerular capillary loops | Not typical; suggests membranous nephropathy or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [^82538b50] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely histologic finding in this patient is **cortical thinning with tubular atrophy** (Option C), reflecting chronic reflux nephropathy from vesicoureteral reflux and recurrent infections. The other options represent glomerular diseases not consistent with the clinical scenario.

### Urinary protein markers predict the severity of renal histological lesions in children with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [^69793e3b]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several renal histopathological features, including mesangial hypercellularity, glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, are considered to be independent predictors of end-stage renal failure in patients with glomerular diseases. Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) is characterized by proliferations of mesangial cells with increase in mesangial matrix and/or deposits in mesangial region. The purpose of this study is to determine the association between urinary protein markers measured at the same time as renal biopsy and the severity of renal histological lesions in children with MesPGN, and to evaluate whether these markers could serve as predictors of severe renal histological lesions in this population.

Methods

Ninety-eight children with MesPGN (40 with IgA nephropathy, 37 with IgM nephropathy, and 21 with MesPGN without IgA/IgM deposition) were enrolled. Urinary level of IgG, albumin, transferrin, α1-microglobulin, β2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase from a morning sample before biopsy was measured. The scores of mesangial hypercellularity, glomerulosclerosis, and tubule-interstitial damage were used to semi-quantitatively evaluate renal histological lesions.

Results

The urine proteins, as independent factors associated with severe mesangial cellularity (> 5 mesangial cells/ mesangial area) were transferrin, albumin, α1-microglobulin, IgG and 24-hour total protein, with severe glomerulosclerosis (≥ 10% glomeruli showing segmental adhesions or sclerosis) were transferrin and 24-hour total protein, and with severe tubule-interstitial damage (focal or diffuse tubular and interstitial lesions) were transferrin and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. Urinary transferrin achieved the area under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively, for predicting severe mesangial cellularity and glomerulosclerosis. Urinary N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase achieved the highest AUC of 0.82 for predicting severe tubule-interstitial damage. The combination of urinary protein markers, however, did not improve the predictability for renal histological lesions.

Conclusions

Urinary protein markers are useful to predict the severity of renal histological lesions in children with MesPGN, which suggests that urinary proteins might be useful to predict the development and progression of renal histological lesions, and assist in evaluating the outcome and prognosis in children with MesPGN as non-invasive and easily repeatable indicators on the follow-up examination.

There were some limitations to this study. First, the optimal evaluation of the subgroup analysis was hindered due to the small sample size. Second, the follow-up period was relatively short, meaning further evaluation of renal function was halted. Third, constraints of retrospective study apply, indicating that the decision on dosages and types of immunosuppressive agents was at the discretion of each attending nephrologist. However, it should be noted that the average dosages of immunosuppressive agents were similar between patients with and without IgM mesangial deposition, as shown in Supplementary Table 1.

KDIGO Living Kidney Donor Work Group — IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and hematuria-related risks are detailed. IgA nephropathy that presents with hematuria and minimal proteinuria is often a progressive disease, and in a Hong Kong series of 72 consecutive patients with minimal proteinuria (0.4 g/day or less) followed for a median of 84 months, 33% developed proteinuria, 26% became hypertensive, and 7% developed impaired kidney function. The presence of hematuria and glomerular IgA deposition is associated with increased risk of progressive kidney disease even without other clinical findings, and there is broad consensus that people with known IgA nephropathy should not donate a kidney. In implantation biopsies at a Korean center (including 446 living donors), latent mesangial IgA deposition was present in 16.1% of living donor allograft biopsies and was associated with a mild degree of microhematuria, mesangial proliferation and glomerular macrophage infiltration in some affected individuals, especially with C3 deposition.

Practice Point 2.4.1 — IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with nephrotic syndrome notes that patients may rarely present with the nephrotic syndrome, including edema, hypoalbuminemia, and nephrotic-range proteinuria > 3.5 g/d; in such cases, mesangial IgA deposition can show light and electron microscopy features consistent with a podocytopathy resembling minimal change disease (MCD), and when a biopsy demonstrates features consistent with MCD, patients should be treated in accordance with the guidelines for MCD; if the biopsy shows coexistent mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), management should follow that for patients at high risk of progressive chronic kidney disease despite maximal supportive care; nephrotic-range proteinuria without nephrotic syndrome in IgAN commonly reflects secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or advanced chronic damage.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in… [^934bc68f]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of urinary tract infections in children continue to evolve. Although a somewhat less aggressive approach to evaluation is now recommended, it is important for primary care physicians to appropriately diagnose and treat UTIs in children. Some underlying etiologies, including renal scarring and renal disease, can lead to considerable morbidity later in life. 9 However, more recent studies question the association between pyelonephritis and end-stage renal disease. 10 Baseline abnormalities of the urogenital tract have been reported in up to 3. 2 percent of healthy, screened infants. 11 Additionally, obstructive anomalies are found in up to 4 percent and vesicoureteral reflux in 8 to 40 percent of children being evaluated for their first UTI. Children younger than two years may be at greater risk of parenchymal defects than older children.
12.

Follow-up assessment to confirm an appropriate clinical response should be performed 48 to 72 hours after initiating antimicrobial therapy in all children with UTI. Culture and susceptibility results may indicate that a change of antibiotic is necessary. If expected clinical improvement does not occur, consider further evaluation. Referral to a subspecialist is indicated if vesicoureteral reflux, renal scarring, anatomic abnormalities, or renal calculi are discovered, or if invasive imaging procedures are considered. 25 A randomized controlled trial of children two months to seven years of age found that prophylactic antibiotics for 12 months following a febrile UTI did not reduce the risk of subsequent UTI, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux.

26 Another randomized controlled trial of children and adolescents with pyelonephritis found that antibiotic prophylaxis did not prevent subsequent UTIs in patients with no documented vesicoureteral reflux or with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. 27 Antibiotic prophylaxis may be more beneficial in children with more severe vesicoureteral reflux, however. 28 The most recent Cochrane review on the subject concluded that large, properly randomized, double-blind studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children. 1 Additionally, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis in children younger than two and a half years with vesicoureteral reflux may not decrease the risk of pyelonephritis or renal damage. 29.

Nomenclature and clinical features of the membranoproliferative pattern of glomerulonephritis (GN) indicate that it is a light-microscopic pattern characterized by an increased number of intraglomerular cells and diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary walls; the clinical presentation is not specific and commonly includes proteinuria (frequently associated with the nephrotic syndrome [NS]), hypertension, glomerular hematuria, and abnormal kidney function; hypocomplementemia (C3 and/or C4) is often, but not always, present, an MPGN pattern of injury may be found in many unrelated disorders, and identifying disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms is critical for appropriate management.

### Tubulointerstitial renal disease [^09bae494]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Tubulointerstitial damage, in progressive chronic renal disease of all types, arises because of a complex interplay between factors in the tubular lumen, tubular epithelial cells, peritubular capillaries, resident and infiltrating interstitial cells and extracellular matrix. Particularly in proteinuric renal disease, tubular epithelial cells play a central role in orchestrating these events. In response to mediators arising systemically, in the tubular lumen or from other renal cells, tubular epithelial cells undergo a complex series of structural and functional changes and produce a bewildering number of soluble and fixed mediators, which in turn lead to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Knowledge of these interactions has increased exponentially over the past decade, and has defined a number of new targets for treatment. Both expansion and consolidation of this knowledge is needed to determine which of these targets holds the most promise for future treatment.

### Urinary protein markers predict the severity of renal histological lesions in children with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [^6e2709a2]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, urinary protein markers show a significant relationship with the severity of renal histological lesions. Urinary transferrin could, as an independent factor, predict severe mesangial cellularity and glomerulosclerosis. Urinary NAG could predict tubulointerstitial damage with greater accuracy than other urinary proteins in children with MesPGN. Our study suggests that on the follow-up examination, these findings have potential significance for understanding the histopathological lesions of glomeruli and tubulointerstitium in children with MesPGN without a renal biopsy. Urinary protein markers might be useful to predict the development and progression of renal histological lesions, and assist in evaluating the outcome and prognosis in children with MesPGN as non-invasive and easily repeatable indicators. Further follow-up studies are needed to confirm the association of urine protein markers and renal histological lesions with clinical outcome in children with MesPGN.

### Development of a multiple urinary biomarker model to predict the tubulointerstitial fibrosis area in patients with primary IgA nephropathy [^6542f25a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Its clinical course varies from indolent forms with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to those with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Despite treatment, about 20–40% of patients will progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Poor prognostic factors are: the presence of kidney failure at diagnosis, proteinuria above 1 g/day despite renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, arterial hypertension, mesangial C4d deposits and CD68 + tubulointerstitial infiltration of monocytes-macrophages, which correlates with tubulo-interstitial fibrosis (IF) and chronic damage. These glomerular and interstitial lesions have prognostic value in untreated patients, but not in those who have received prior treatment with glucocorticoids or immunomodulators.

The Working Group of the International IgA Nephropathy Network and the Renal Pathology Society (RPS) reported that tubulointerstitial injury on kidney biopsy plays an important role in the IgAN progression. Several studies have focused on certain tubular biomarkers as predictors of renal progression in patients with IgAN; thus, interstitial fibrosis (IF) is a powerful predictor of future progression in IgAN.

The Oxford Classification of IgAN is the most widely accepted system for evaluating histological features in biopsy specimens with a minimum of 8 glomeruli. The MEST-C score, including mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary cellularity (E), segmental sclerosis (S), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (T), and crescent (C) lesions, is predictive of clinical renal outcomes.

IgAN may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) despite absence of any previous clinical risk factors, therefore, it is not unusual to find severe chronic tubulointerstitial damage in patients with clinically mild IgAN. Furthermore, when renal biopsy it´s performed at the early stages, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 60 ml/min, pathological findings might be inconclusive and renal prognosis could be difficult to stablish, therefore, a non-invasive method to follow these patients is needed.

### Protective effects of L-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) in proximal tubular cells against glomerular injury in Anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis [^27d8829e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Several recent reports have indicated that protection against tubular damage may improve renal prognosis independent of the type of glomerular disease. This is mainly due to the fact that renal prognosis is closely linked to the expansion of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, there is little information on whether protection against tubular damage influences the progression of glomerular injury and exacerbation of tubulointerstitial damage. We have recently reported that tubular L-FABP activated by mesangial cell-origin humoral factors may lessen progression of glomerular damage in IgA nephropathy by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators, suggesting that glomerulotubular/tubule glomerular cross-talk may underlie and affect renal prognosis, at least in the chronic renal disease.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN) is a well-established model of severe and acute glomerular damage and is associated with severe proteinuria and tubulointerstitial damage. Because L-FABP is not expressed in the kidneys of rodents, we generated hL-FABP chromosomal transgenic (Tg) mice that expressed hL-FABP only in the renal proximal tubules. Using these hL-FABP Tg mice, we examined whether reinforcement of tubular protective capacity influenced the progression of the acute glomerular injury in anti-GBM GN.

### Validation of the oxford classification of IgA nephropathy for pediatric patients from China [^c9f1785d]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Patients with IgAN have variable clinical courses, and the decision on which patients to treat should be based on prognostic factors and the risk of progression. Although estimation of the prognosis has mainly been based on clinical characteristics, pathological features have also been reported as risk factors for progression. Several histologic classification systems have been devised for predicting progression of IgAN. However, none has become widely used, partly because the reproducibility of histological variables were not tested in those classifications.

The new Oxford classification of IgAN, based on 265 patients collected from eight countries on four continents, identified four definitive histological features, with high reproducibility and low collinearity, for the prediction of renal prognosis of IgAN: mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary proliferation (E), segmental sclerosis or adhesion (S), and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (T). However, the development of the Oxford classification involved patients with an age range encompassing pediatric and adult patients. Several studies, including the original Oxford study, have shown that the histological features of IgAN in children and adults are remarkably different. Compared with adults, children with IgAN showed significantly more mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity, and less chronic tubulointerstitial and vascular damage. Hence, whether the classification system has the similar predictive power for children with IgAN in different populations needs to be validated further.

Recently, several validation studies of the Oxford classification have been published, however, most of these studies focused on adult patients with IgAN. A study performed by Edström et. al found that the presence of S was not associated with the long-term renal outcome in a cohort of pediatric IgAN patients from Sweden. Shima et. al analyzed 161 consecutive children with IgAN from Japan and found that M, T, and crescents (> 30%) were significant univariate analyses. We herein report a multicenter validation study of the Oxford classification, using similar inclusion criteria and statistical analysis, in a cohort of children with IgAN from China.

### Resolution of IgM nephropathy after rituximab treatment [^1a7a8359]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) nephropathy is an idiopathic glomerulonephritis characterized by mesangial deposits of IgM. IgM nephropathy presenting with proteinuria, especially nephrotic syndrome, frequently is steroid dependent or steroid resistant and associated with reaching end-stage renal disease after a 15-year follow-up. Because no long-term effective treatment is known for patients with IgM nephropathy, there is a clear need for therapeutic alternatives. We describe a patient who reached end-stage renal disease 20 years after IgM nephropathy was diagnosed at the age of 3 years. IgM nephropathy recurred after kidney transplantation, leading to microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. High-dose steroid therapy was not effective, and kidney function slowly decreased. Three years after transplantation, 2 doses of rituximab were administered, leading to complete remission of the IgM nephropathy. One year after rituximab treatment, the patient has stable kidney function, normal urinary sediment, and no proteinuria. Rituximab may be a valuable novel therapeutic drug for the treatment of patients with IgM nephropathy.

### Urinary protein markers predict the severity of renal histological lesions in children with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [^1955ffed]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis are due to the increased protein traffic across the tubular cells in glomerular diseases. Accumulated evidence suggests that abnormally filtered proteins reaching the tubular lumen might be responsible for the injury of tubular cells, triggering the release of several proinflammatory cytokines, which cause interstitial inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Urinary NAG, which results from the increased excretion of an isoenzyme synthesized in the tubular cells exposed to various toxic substances is useful for the detection of tubulointerstitial damage in children with MesPGN in our study. This result is in agreement with previous studies. It has also been showed that increased NAG excretion, associated with increased transferrin excretion could occur even in the absence of morphological evidence of tubular cells damage.

In previous studies, the urinary excretion of α1- microglobulin, β2- microglobulin and IgG is also considered a marker for detection of tubular lesions in patients with glomerular diseases by correlation analysis. Our study confirmed the correlation of various urinary proteins, except β2- microglobulin, with tubulointerstitial damage in children with MesPGN (Spearman's correlation test, data not shown). However, by binary logistic regression analysis, only urinary excretion of NAG and transferrin, but not that of IgG, albumin, α1- microglobulin and β2- microglobulin, was significantly associated with the extent of tubulointerstitial damage.

### Pathways to nephron loss starting from glomerular diseases-insights from animal models [^4e8742e8]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Studies of glomerular diseases in animal models show that progression toward nephron loss starts with extracapillary lesions, whereby podocytes play the central role. If injuries remain bound within the endocapillary compartment, they will undergo recovery or be repaired by scaring. Degenerative, inflammatory and dysregulative mechanisms leading to nephron loss are distinguished. In addition to several other unique features, the dysregulative mechanisms leading to collapsing glomerulopathy are particular in that glomeruli and tubules are affected in parallel. In contrast, in degenerative and inflammatory diseases, tubular injury is secondary to glomerular lesions. In both of the latter groups of diseases, the progression starts in the glomerulus with the loss of the separation between the tuft and Bowman's capsule by forming cell bridges (parietal cells and/or podocytes) between the glomerular and the parietal basement membranes. Cell bridges develop into tuft adhesions to Bowman's capsule, which initiate the formation of crescents, either by misdirected filtration (proteinaceous crescents) or by epithelial cell proliferation (cellular crescents). Crescents may spread over the entire circumference of the glomerulus and, via the glomerulotubular junction, may extend onto the tubule. Two mechanisms concerning the transfer of a glomerular injury onto the tubulointerstitium are discussed: (1) direct encroachment of extracapillary lesions and (2) protein leakage into tubular urine, resulting in injury to the tubule and the interstitium. There is evidence that direct encroachment is the crucial mechanism. Progression of chronic renal disease is underlain by a vicious cycle which passes on the damage from lost and/or damaged nephrons to so far healthy nephrons. Presently, two mechanisms are discussed: (1) the loss of nephrons leads to compensatory mechanisms in the remaining nephrons (glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, hypertrophy) which increase their vulnerability to any further challenge (overload hypothesis); and (2) a proteinuric glomerular disease leads, by some way or another, to tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis, accounting for the further deterioration of renal function (fibrosis hypothesis). So far, no convincing evidence has been published that in primary glomerular diseases fibrosis is harmful to healthy nephrons. The potential of glomerular injuries to regenerate or to be repaired by scaring is limited. The only option for extracapillary injuries with tuft adhesion is repair by formation of a segmental adherent scar (i.e., segmental glomerulosclerosis).

The outcome of steroid-dependent or frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome of minimal change disease (MCD), mesangial proliferative GN (MesGN), or FSGS may be poor and with major treatment toxicity. This academic, multicenter, off-on trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00981838) primarily evaluated the effects of rituximab therapy followed by immunosuppression withdrawal on disease recurrence in 10 children and 20 adults with MCD/MesGN (n = 22) or FSGS who had suffered ≥ 2 recurrences over the previous year and were in steroid-induced remission for ≥ 1 month. Participants received one dose (n = 28) or two doses of rituximab (375 mg/m² intravenously). At 1 year, all patients were in remission: 18 were treatment-free and 15 never relapsed. Compared with the year before rituximab treatment, total relapses decreased from 88 to 22 and the per-patient median number of relapses decreased from 2.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 2–4) to 0.5 (IQR, 0–1; P < 0.001) during 1 year of follow-up. Reduction was significant across subgroups (children, adults, MCD/MesGN, and FSGS; P < 0.01). After rituximab, the per-patient steroid maintenance median dose decreased from 0.27 mg/kg (IQR, 0.19–0.60) to 0 mg/kg (IQR, 0–0.23) (P < 0.001), and the median cumulative dose to achieve relapse remission decreased from 19.5 mg/kg (IQR, 13.0–29.2) to 0.5 mg/kg (IQR, 0–9.4) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean estimated GFR increased from 111.3 ± 25.7 to 121.8 ± 29.2 ml/min per 1.73 m² (P = 0.01), with the largest increases in children and in FSGS subgroups. The mean height z score slope stabilized in children (P < 0.01). Treatment was well tolerated. Rituximab effectively and safely prevented recurrences and reduced the need for immunosuppression in steroid-dependent or frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, and halted disease-associated growth deficit in children.

### Renal thrombotic microangiopathy and nephrotic proteinuria induced by intravitreal injection of aflibercept for diabetic macular edema [^4b73b330]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The glomerular changes in the present case are consistent pathologically with diabetic nephropathy (class III); however, considering the doubling of the glomerular capillary wall (basement membrane) and expansion of the subendothelial space, the morphological findings are also compatible with renal TMA. In fact, the improvement of proteinuria after discontinuing intravitreal aflibercept suggests that the primary cause of proteinuria was renal TMA due to intravitreal aflibercept rather than coexisted diabetic nephropathy.

There have been reports of TMA improvement after discontinuing of intravitreal injection of VFGFI for AMD and glaucoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is a precious report of renal TMA that developed due to intravitreal injection of aflibercept for DME in a patient with type 2 DM, which improved simply by discontinuing aflibercept, without the use of corticosteroids or other drugs.

Additionally, there have been several reports of the occurrence of clinical symptoms after the initiation of intravitreal injections of VEGFI, although histopathological examinations of renal biopsy specimens were not performed. The most common condition was worsening eGFR, others were proteinuria, hypertension, hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, and relapsed minimal change disease.

Kidney damage associated with DM is often irreversible. However, proteinuria due to intravitreal injection of VEGFI may be reversible. In patients with a long history of DM, it would be difficult to determine whether the kidney damage is due to DM or intravitreal injection of VEGFI in the clinical course. If kidney damage develops after starting intravitreal injection of VEGFI, we recommend performing histopathological examination of renal biopsy and discontinuing VEGFI immediately.

This patient had no familial history of TMA and did not present clinical features or autoantibodies suggesting autoimmune disease. VEGFI-induced renal TMA rarely develops the classical hematologic abnormalities found in acute general TMA. Our report is, however, limited by not confirming serum aflibercept level, serum VEGF level, haptoglobin level, and ADAMTS13 level. Nevertheless, we consider that it does not take away the merit of this case report, since it included a histopathological examination of renal biopsy specimen. In the future, repeat renal biopsy proving the disappearance of the TMA would further support our conclusion.

### Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin, a tubulointerstitial disease [^ac4e318c]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease of undetermined cause is characterized by distinctive histopathological features predominantly affecting the tubulointerstitial compartment of the kidney. Kidney biopsies from affected individuals consistently demonstrate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy as the hallmark findings, observed in over 80–90% of cases, with severity correlating closely with decreased glomerular filtration rate. Interstitial inflammation is generally mild or absent in early disease stages but may increase in advanced fibrosis, with T lymphocytes and macrophages predominating. Tubulitis and acute tubular injury are rare and usually restricted to patients presenting acutely. Electron microscopy reveals ultrastructural tubular changes such as cell detachment, basement membrane thickening, and collagen fibril deposition, though these are nonspecific. Glomerular abnormalities are typically secondary, including glomerulosclerosis in less than 50% of glomeruli, glomerulomegaly, and periglomerular fibrosis, reflecting compensatory hypertrophy or reduced nephron number. Immune complex deposition is minimal or absent. Vascular changes are generally not prominent. Despite the diagnostic value of kidney biopsy in chronic kidney disease of undetermined cause, clinical use is limited by socioeconomic factors, procedural risks, and lack of targeted therapies. Standardized biopsy protocols and reporting are essential for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and understanding disease mechanisms to guide future research and treatment strategies.

### Long-term outcomes of Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy [^af863843]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Next, we evaluated the pathological impact of glomeruli, tubulointerstitium, and vessels on renal events, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. As to glomerular lesions related to renal events, diffuse lesions, nodular lesions, exudative lesions, and mesangiolysis were identified as the pathological determinants in this study. Previous reports have found that diffuse lesions, nodular lesions, and mesangiolysis are associated with renal outcome in accordance with our results (,–).

In addition to glomerular lesions, IFTA was identified as the pathological determinant for renal events and all-cause mortality in this study. There are numerous studies suggesting that tubulointerstitial damage, as well as glomerular damage, contributes to a decline in renal function. However, this is the first report identifying IFTA as the predictor of all-cause mortality in diabetic nephropathy. In IgA nephropathy, a Japanese scoring system consisting of clinical findings and histological grades has been reported to predict 10-year risk of end-stage renal disease as well as all-cause mortality risk. Even though the histological evaluation is not commonly applied in patients with diabetic nephropathy and we are unable to assess sufficiently how confounding factors influenced our results, the evaluation of renal lesions in addition to clinical findings may improve mortality risk prediction in diabetic nephropathy.

Furthermore, arteriosclerosis in renal biopsy specimens was identified as the pathological determinant for renal events and cardiovascular events in this study. Arteriosclerosis included in the evaluation proposed by the Renal Pathology Society in the U.S. has been shown to worsen glomerular lesions in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, several autopsy-based studies have shown that intimal thickness of small renal arteries and renal arteriolar hyalinization are strongly associated with atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries, aorta, and major cerebral vessels. These data support our results.

Considering these findings, various pathological lesions in glomeruli, tubulointerstitium, and vessels were orchestrated to promote and escalate diabetic kidney injuries, resulting in renal failure. It is important to determine whether pathological information from renal biopsy improves the predictive power when added to albuminuria and renal dysfunction. Based on our results, it is reasonable to predict renal prognosis of diabetic nephropathy by combination of clinical and pathological parameters. Prospective studies to develop a prognostic model by research biopsy may be useful for addressing this issue. Furthermore, we speculate that the evaluation of renal pathology provides a key for overall management including renal events and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

### Long-term kidney disease outcomes in fibrillary glomerulonephritis: a case series of 27 patients [^2acf452e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (GN) is a rare disorder with poor renal prognosis. Therapeutic strategies, particularly the use of immunosuppressive drugs, are debated.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

27 adults with fibrillary GN referred to 15 nephrology departments in France between 1990 and 2011 were included. All patients were given renin-angiotensin system blockers and 13 received immunosuppressive therapy, including rituximab (7 patients) and cyclophosphamide (3 patients).

Outcomes & Measurements

Clinical and histologic features of patients and kidney disease outcome. Renal response was defined as a > 50% decrease in 24-hour proteinuria with < 15% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Results

All patients presented with proteinuria, associated with nephrotic syndrome (41%), hematuria (73%), and hypertension (70%). Baseline median eGFR was 49 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Eight patients had a history of autoimmune disease and none had evidence of hematologic malignancy during follow-up. Light microscopic studies showed mesangial GN (70%), predominant pattern of membranous GN (19%), or membranoproliferative GN (11%). By immunofluorescence, immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposits (IgG4, 15/15; IgG1, 9/15) were polyclonal in 25 cases. Serum IgG subclass distribution was normal in the 6 patients tested. After a median 46-month follow-up, renal response occurred in 6 of 13 patients who received immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab (5 patients) or cyclophosphamide (1 patient). Of these, 5 had a mesangial or membranous light microscopic pattern, and median eGFR before therapy was 76 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In contrast, chronic kidney disease progressed in 12 of 14 patients who were not given immunosuppressive therapy, 10 of whom reached end-stage renal disease.

Limitations

Number of patients, retrospective study, use of multiple immunosuppressive regimens.

Conclusions

The therapeutic approach in fibrillary GN remains challenging. The place of immunosuppressive therapy, particularly anti-B-cell agents, needs to be assessed in larger collaborative studies.

Idiopathic immune complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) — supportive care threshold and exclusions: For most patients with idiopathic ICGN presenting with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, treat with supportive care alone, but limiting to supportive care does not apply to cases with an active necrotizing or crescentic GN or an additional cause of acute tubulointerstitial inflammation as the cause of the low GFR; cases with otherwise preserved renal parenchyma, significant acute tubular necrosis, and/or no significant fibrosis or atrophy also would not fall into this category.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) [^fea592d0]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to treatment goals, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that kidney biopsy features are often used to inform treatment decisions in IgAN, but biopsies provide only a snapshot of a small tissue sample. There is no evidence from clinical studies showing that patients randomized to treatment regimens based on Oxford Classification MEST-C scores have better outcomes. Specifically:

- there is insufficient evidence to base treatment decisions solely on the presence and number of cellular/fibrocellular crescents in the kidney biopsy. Interpret histopathologic features in the context of clinical features, particularly the rate of change in eGFR

- while it seems logical that very proliferative or inflammatory lesions may respond better to anti-inflammatory treatments than sclerotic or fibrotic lesions, this has not been proven in prospective clinical trials.

### Proliferative glomerulonephritis due to monoclonal deposition with organized substructures [^0a11fd56]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A growing number of monoclonal gammopathy-associated kidney diseases recently have been recognized. We present the case of a 54-year-old man who presented with acute kidney injury and hypocomplementemia. Kidney biopsy confirmed the presence of immunoglobulin G κ pseudothrombi with intracytoplasmic crystals in glomeruli and tubules. Levels of κ free light chains were elevated without a detectable monoclonal gammopathy, and bone marrow biopsy results were normal. After the first course of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in addition to daily plasmapheresis, kidney function recovered within 2 weeks and dialysis therapy was discontinued. Treatment for monoclonal protein-induced kidney disease should be considered in the setting of progressive decreased kidney function, even in the absence of a circulating monoclonal protein or cellular clone of origin.

### The tubulointerstitium in health and disease: more than what meets the eye [^442dc698]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The tubulointerstitium is a critical component of the nephron. It is a highly vascularized compartment that plays an important part in kidney health and function. The tubulointerstitium orchestrates the clinical effects of volume control, electrolyte and acid-base balance, medication and toxin secretion, hormone production, immunological and inflammatory processes, and tubular repair processes. These important interconnected processes within the tubulointerstitial compartment that are independent of glomerular filtration require an intact tubulointerstitium to achieve optimal kidney function. When cellular injury occurs due to toxic, oxidative, inflammatory, and other insults and the repair processes to address this damage are incomplete, absent or untoward, acute and chronic tubulointerstitial disease develops. Direct tubular injury and deleterious inflammatory processes play important roles in tubulointerstitial nephritis. Over time, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and eventually glomerulosclerosis occurs. It is therefore not surprising that various forms of injury in this compartment can impair the previously described homeostatic processes.

### Role of rituximab therapy in glomerulonephritis [^f7c966c2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

B cell depletion with the monoclonal antibody rituximab is attracting increasing attention in systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, and primary glomerulonephritis. Existing, uncontrolled data report high response rates in patients with refractory disease. If supported by the results of ongoing randomized trials, then rituximab and related B cell-depleting or -modulating drugs are likely to become a component in the future management of these disorders. Their use may improve patient outcomes by permitting more complete disease control and reduced exposure to glucocorticoid and traditional immunosuppressive drugs. The toxicity and infective risk of B cell-targeted agents in renal disease needs to be determined as well as their optimal dosing in combination with conventional agents.

### Long-term efficacy, safety and neurotolerability of MATRix regimen followed by autologous transplant in primary CNS lymphoma: 7-year results of the IELSG32 randomized trial [^14acd9ef]. Leukemia (2022). Medium credibility.

219 HIV-negative adults ≤ 70 years with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) were enrolled in the randomized IELSG32 trial. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive methotrexate-cytarabine (arm A), or methotrexate-cytarabine-rituximab (B), or methotrexate-cytarabine-thiotepa-rituximab (MATRix; arm C). A second randomization allocated patients with responsive/stable disease to whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or carmustine-thiotepa-conditioned autologous transplantation (ASCT). First results, after a median follow-up of 30 months, showed that MATRix significantly improves outcome, with both WBRT and ASCT being similarly effective. However, sound assessment of overall survival (OS), efficacy of salvage therapy, late complications, secondary tumors, and cognitive impairment requires longer follow-up. Herein, we report the results of this trial at a median follow-up of 88 months. As main findings, MATRix was associated with excellent long-lasting outcome, with a 7-year OS of 21%, 37%, and 56% respectively for arms A, B, and C. Notably, patients treated with MATRix and consolidation had a 7-year OS of 70%. The superiority of arm B on arm A suggests a benefit from the addition of rituximab. Comparable efficacy of WBRT and ASCT was confirmed. Salvage therapy was ineffective; benefit was recorded only in patients with late relapse re-treated with methotrexate. Eight (4%) patients developed a second cancer. Importantly, MATRix and ASCT did not result in higher non-relapse mortality or second tumors incidence. Patients who received WBRT experienced impairment in attentiveness and executive functions, whereas patients undergoing ASCT experienced improvement in these functions as well as in memory and quality of life.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^d0755e2d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma induction regimens — randomized evidence includes the international phase 2 MATRix trial (N = 219) with three arms (methotrexate and cytarabine; methotrexate, cytarabine, and rituximab; and methotrexate, cytarabine, rituximab, and thiotepa), in which complete response was more likely in the MATRix arm (49%; 95% CI, 38%–60%) versus the methotrexate, cytarabine, and rituximab arm (30%; 95% CI, 21%–42%) and the methotrexate + cytarabine arm (23%; 95% CI, 14%–31%). The multicenter randomized HOVON study (N = 200) tested methotrexate, carmustine, teniposide, and prednisolone with or without rituximab; OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 79% (95% CI, 69%–86%), 65% (95% CI, 55%–74%), and 61% (95% CI, 51%–71%) without rituximab versus 79% (95% CI, 69%–85%), 71% (95% CI, 60%–79%), and 58% (95% CI, 46%–68%) with rituximab. Limitations included exclusion of patients aged > 70 years, the MATRix regimen's association with significant marrow toxicity, use of consolidation WBRT in younger patients and only six doses of rituximab in HOVON, and that teniposide is not FDA approved for this indication and is no longer available in the United States; methotrexate/carmustine/teniposide/prednisone with or without rituximab was subsequently removed from the Guidelines as an induction therapy option in 2022.

### Biomarkers of tubulointerstitial damage and function in type 1 diabetes [^9c27b24a]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In type 1 diabetes, marked abnormalities in biomarkers of kidney tubular injury, inflammation, fibrosis, secretion, and synthetic function accompany reduced eGFR and albuminuria. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the time course over which these biomarkers of tubulointerstitial function change relative to eGFR and albuminuria and to determine whether these biomarkers are associated with DKD progression and complications. Biomarkers of tubulointerstitial damage and function may be useful for the development of new therapies targeting DKD.

### Protective effects of L-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) in proximal tubular cells against glomerular injury in Anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis [^f000d2cd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background. In glomerulonephritis (GN), an overload of free fatty acids (FFA) bound to albumin in urinary protein may induce oxidative stress in the proximal tubules. Human liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (hL-FABP) expressed in human proximal tubules, but not rodents, participates in intracellular FFA metabolism and exerts anti-oxidative effects on the progression of tubulointerstitial damage. We examined whether tubular enhancement of this anti-oxidative action modulates the progression of glomerular damage in immune-mediated GN in hL-FABP chromosomal gene transgenic (Tg) mice.

Methods. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN) was induced in Tg and wild-type mice (WT). Proteinuria, histopathology, polymorphonuclear (PMN) influx, expression of tubulointerstitial markers for oxidative stress 4-hydroxy-2-Nonenal (HNE) and fibrosis (α-smooth muscle actin), proximal tubular damage (Kim-1), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPAR γ) and inflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)] were analyzed. The mice were also treated with an angiotensin type II receptor blocker (ARB).

Results. The urinary protein level in Tg mice decreased significantly during the acute phase (∼Day 5). Tg mice survived for a significantly longer time than WT mice, with an attenuation of tubulointerstitial damage score and expression of each tubulointerstitial damage marker observed at Day 7. Expression of inflammatory cytokines on Day 7 was higher in WT mice than Tg mice and correlated strongly with PPARγ expression in WT mice, but not in Tg mice. Interestingly, Tg mice showed insufficient PMN influx at 3 and 6 h, with simultaneous elevation of urinary L-FABP and reduction in HNE expression. The two strains of mice showed different types of glomerular damage, with mild mesangial proliferation in Tg mice and severe endothelial swelling with vascular thrombosis in WT mice. The glomerular damage in Tg mice was improved by administration of an ARB.

Conclusions. The present experimental model suggests that tubular enhancement of L-FABP may protect mice with anti-GBM GN from progression of both tubulointerstitial and glomerular injury.

### Simultaneous clinical resolution of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab [^a1bfc736]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The patient showed a gradual response to therapy (Figure 1). One month after the fourth dose, he had complete resolution of oedema, the WBC count had decreased to 3,500/mm 3 (ALC: 0.98/mm 3), and urinary protein excretion had dropped to 0.7/g/day. Serum creatinine was normal at 1.0 g/dL, serum cholesterol had decreased to 195 mg/dL, and serum albumin had increased to 4.4 g/dL. Immunoglobulin and beta2 microglobulin values were normal. After completion of the 6 cycles of therapy, a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was normal. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed normal haematopoietic cells without clonal B cells. The patient continued to receive rituximab (375 mg/m² every 3 months) as maintenance therapy for the next 24 months. At the last follow up 28 months after diagnosis the patient remains in complete remission and the urinary protein excretion is below 200 mg/day under antihypertensive treatment.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^5a0953ee]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease — additional tests for evaluation of cause (Table 6) describe four categories with examples and key uses. Imaging (ultrasound, intravenous urography, CT kidneys ureters bladder, nuclear medicine studies, MRI) is used to assess kidney structure (i.e., kidney shape, size, symmetry, and evidence of obstruction) for cystic disease and reflux disease, with an evolving role for additional technologies such as 3D ultrasound. Kidney biopsy (ultrasound‑guided percutaneous) specimens are usually examined by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, and may include molecular diagnostics; biopsy is used for exact diagnosis, planning treatment, assessing activity and chronicity of disease, and likelihood of treatment response, and may also be used to assess genetic disease. Laboratory tests include chemistry (acid‑base and electrolytes), serologic tests such as anti‑PLA2R, ANCA, anti‑GBM antibodies, serum‑free light chains with serum and urine protein electrophoresis/immunofixation, and urinalysis/urine sediment; guidance highlights recognition of light chains in kidney disease even without multiple myeloma (monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS)) and states that persistent hematuria or albuminuria is critical in determining differential diagnosis; it also refers to the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases. Genetic testing examples include APOL1, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, NPHS1, UMOD, HNF1B, PKD1, and PKD2, and it is described as evolving as a tool for diagnosis with increased utilization expected and recognition that genetic causes are more common and may present without classic family history.

### Renal outcome in adults with renal insufficiency and irregular asymmetric kidneys [^100a85eb]. BMC Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

In an Italian study, 80 patients were followed for a mean of 5.6 years and retrospectively stratified into those with stable renal function and those with slowly or rapidly progressive renal failure. For those with progressive nephropathy, there was no difference in initial renal function but proteinuria was much greater in the rapidly progressive group. Loss of function was unusual with creatinine ≤ 1.7 mg/dl (150 μmol/l) and inevitable above that concentration.

In a UK study from Newcastle, proteinuria and renal insufficiency (plasma creatinine > 130 μmol/l) were present from presentation in 21% and 13% of 125 patients respectively, and with time (mean 5.9 years) a further 21% developed proteinuria and 22% renal insufficiency. In all the 16 patients with progressive renal failure, the decline was linear. In a subsequent report, progressive renal failure did not develop in 138 adult patients with normal function at the start (plasma creatinine < 90 μmol/l).

Our data support the established relationship between the risk of progressive nephropathy and renal insufficiency with proteinuria, but suggests a watershed range for renal function as a predictor of outcome. When the eGFR exceeds 40–50 ml/min/1.73 m 2 nephropathy rarely progresses, but disease progression is invariable when function is worse. Nakashima et al. similarly reported that an isotopic GFR less than 49 ml/min predicted decline to ESRF.

The other determining factor of poor renal outcome is proteinuria, and we find that deterioration can be expected when proteinuria exceeds 50 mg/mmol (0.5 g/d). In a Japanese study, serial biopsy samples from patients with reflux nephropathy confirmed the close association between the degree of renal scarring, the extent of the glomerular pathology, and proteinuria. Once extensive glomerular sclerosis was present there was conspicuous glomerular hypertrophy which correlated with increasing proteinuria. This is consistent with our findings that proteinuria increased as renal function declined. The prognostic importance of proteinuria is emphasised by our observation that 6 of the 25 (24%) patients with proteinuria ≥ 200 mg/mmol developed ESRF despite initial eGFRs exceeding 40 ml/min. On the other hand, the survival outcome benefit of ACEI treatment was most conspicuous when patients with proteinuria = 100 mg/mmol were compared (p < 0.00001).

### Simultaneous clinical resolution of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab [^1ca45311]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Since FSGS is not an antibody-mediated disease, improvement of NS with the FCR regime may seem surprising. However, B cells play an important role as immunoregulatory cells through antigen processing and presentation, recruitment of auto-reactive T cells, interaction with antigen presenting cells, and secretion of cytokines. B cell depletion under FCR may affect T cell activation and downregulate the costimulation status.

The primary site of glomerular injury in FSGS is the podocyte. A variety of factors have been postulated to cause injury to glomerular cells, including circulating cytokines such as permeability altering factor, angiotensin II, macrophage infiltration and other mediators of inflammation. Injury to the podocytes by a circulating toxin is further supported by the rapidity and relatively high incidence of disease recurrence in some patients after renal transplantation. Simultaneous presentation and long term remission of CLL and FSGS in our case is consistent with the interpretation that chemotherapy prevented the synthesis of a nephrotoxic circulating lymphokine secreted by malignant cells. A potential paraneoplastic link between malignancies and glomerulonephropathies is difficult to demonstrate, but is supported in our patient by the parallel improvement and longterm resolution of the two conditions under treatment.

### Proteomic signature of tubulointerstitial tissue predicts prognosis in IgAN [^6e9e31b7]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical course of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to rapid progression to kidney failure. Tubular atrophy is one of the most powerful prognostic factors in IgAN and is included in the MEST score of the Oxford Classification.

The mechanisms of tubular damage in IgAN is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that proteinuria, monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and glomerulotubular cross-talk are important players. In addition, tubular epithelial cells (TEC) actively participate by synthesizing inflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The cytokines and chemokines can further recruit inflammatory cells in the interstitium which will also secrete pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic factors and matrix metalloproteinases contributing to inflammation and fibrosis.

It is accepted that the kidney tubuli play a central role in the progression of chronic kidney disease, but most of our knowledge of molecular mechanisms of chronic tubular damage stems from animal models. It is generally believed that mechanisms of tubulointerstitial damage are similar across species and human renal diseases but differences could exist. From a morphological perspective, the tubulointerstitial alterations in progressive IgAN are similar to those found in other chronic kidney diseases, again suggesting that underlying mechanisms might be similar, but a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to these alterations are needed.

Understanding the molecular changes that occur in the tubulointerstitium of patients with IgAN is an important step to understanding the progression of IgAN to kidney failure. In the present study we investigated the proteomic changes of microdissected tubulointerstitial tissue with only mild-moderate damage from patients with progressive vs non progressive IgAN.

### Determination of optimal blood pressure for patients with IgA nephropathy based on renal histology [^710c0190]. Hypertension Research (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the optimal BP control for patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) based on the histologic severity of the nephropathy and the degree of renal dysfunction. We analyzed 332 consecutive renal biopsy specimens and clinical data from patients with IgAN. Patients were divided into three groups based on their BP at the time of biopsy: an optimal BP (SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg), a hypertensive BP (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg), and an intermediate BP group. Each biopsy specimen was evaluated for mesangial proliferation, degree of sclerosis and/or hyalinosis of the arterioles and the interlobular artery using a semiquantitative method. Creatinine clearance and the percentage of sclerosed glomeruli were also determined. Both the degree of renal dysfunction and the histologic changes correlated significantly with BP, even in patients with a BP < 140/90 mmHg. The patients with an optimal BP at the time of biopsy had significantly less histologic damage with respect to mesangial proliferation and vessel changes than those with an intermediate or hypertensive BP. In the patients with a hypertensive BP, the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli was significantly higher and the creatinine clearance was significantly lower. The optimal BP proposed by the WHO in 1999 prevents histologic evidence of renal damage for patients with IgAN.

### MATRix and HD-MTX / IFO / DEP treatment and autologous stem cell transplantation in secondary central nervous system lymphoma: a Dutch retrospective analysis [^6346dccd]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

MATRix induction consists of HD-MTX, cytarabine, rituximab and thiotepa (Online Supplementary Table S1A). The HD-MTX/IFO/DEP induction regimen combines HD-MTX, ifosfamide and liposomal cytarabine, followed by high-dose cytarabine, thiotepa and liposomal-cytarabine. Both regimens incorporate ASCT consolidation but differ in their conditioning protocols. In this study, MATRix induction treatment was followed by rituximab, carmustine (BCNU) and thiotepa conditioning based on the publication of Illerhaus et al. as opposed to the conditioning scheme without rituximab described in the IELSG32 publication by Ferreri et al. The HD-MTX/IFO/DEP+ASCT regimen uses BCNU, thiotepa and etoposide. None of the patients in the MATRix+ASCT or HD-MTX/IFO/DEP+ASCT cohort received R-ICE treatment.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis complicating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia [^1e721609]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Another entity that might be considered in the differential diagnosis is WM-associated nephropathy with prominent intracapillary thrombi and, contrary to our case, lack of relevant proliferation or histiocytic infiltration.

In monoclonal deposit nephropathies, CG presence very often is seen tied to the feature of cellular proliferation. However, several reports in literature can be found describing monoclonal intrarenal IgM deposits and marked glomerular proliferation sometimes with the typical picture of MPGN without proof of CG. Interestingly, negativity for CG is also present in a recently described proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (PGNMID). Comparable to this entity associated with IgG, recently a case of proliferative GN with monoclonal IgM deposits, but without association with WM, was reported. This showed several similarities with the present case, including lack of evidence of CG, presence of a monoclonal IgM and prominent proliferation, so that this case and ours might both be classified as proliferative GN with monoclonal IgM deposits. In contrast to other reported cases that might belong to this group our patient showed a lambda light chain restriction and was female, so that apparently this pattern of injury is not restricted to men and kappa light chain producing lymphoproliferation. The concomitantly observed minor peripheral capillary deposits of IgG, kappa light chains and C3c might either represent a trapping of immunoglobulins and complement in the widened basement membranes or be due to an immune activation maybe caused by the monoclonal IgM.

Presence of CG, conversely, is not always accompanied by prominent glomerular proliferation. Thus, glomerulopathies associated with monoclonal gammopathies include a spectrum of proliferative and non-proliferative GN which can, but need not be associated with the presence of CG. In addition, RA and its treatments can also lead to MPGN. Therefore it cannot be excluded that in the present case RA might be involved in the pathogenesis of MPGN.

Treatment for WM is usually indicated for conditions like progressive, severe anemia and hyperviscosity syndrome, for which there was no evidence in the present patient. Given the impressive renal changes linked to deposition of monoclonal antibodies, we nevertheless felt the urge to treat and suppress their production. The optimal treatment regimen for intrarenal monoclonal deposit disorders has yet to be defined. In general, treatment of the malignancy is expected to alleviate glomerulopathy. Because of the patient's poor general condition, we opted for monotherapy with rituximab. This case illustrates the need for renal biopsy in ARF patients with a positive history for diseases that may be associated with more unusual forms of nephropathy.

### Efficacy of CD19-guided B-cell depletion with rituximab plus steroids in refractory focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [^c8d0712a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the efficacy of RTX in treating FSGS remains heterogeneous. In our study, 25.0% of patients were unresponsive to RTX, and several prior studies have reported even higher rates of non-response to RTX treatment. This variability in response to rituximab may be attributed to the underlying heterogeneity of FSGS, including genetic factors and variations in the susceptibility of podocytes or podocyte progenitors to injury. Chan et al. identified prognostic markers that define a subset of FSGS patients with an immunologic signature indicating reduced T cell responsiveness, suggesting a better response to rituximab. Allinovi, et al. reported that proteinuria selectivity index (the ratio between the urinary clearance of immunoglobulin G and that of transferrin) could predicts response to rituximab in adults with MCD and FSGS. However, this requires confirmation through larger sample studies.

Despite the heterogeneity in RTX efficacy for treating FSGS, our study provides a multi-faceted view of relapse prevention. The RTX strategy not only led to a significant absolute reduction in the number of patients who relapsed but also conferred a substantial reduction in the ongoing risk of relapse over time (HR 0.271), even though the latter did not reach formal statistical significance, likely due to sample size limitations. Previous research also had reported that RTX had a significant impact on reducing disease recurrence.

Although RTX dosing regimens varied, this heterogeneity reflects our response-guided strategy aimed at maintaining B-cell depletion rather than administering a fixed cumulative dose. It has been reported that patients experiencing relapse during the post-rituximab follow-up period exhibited higher B-cell levels compared to those who remained in remission. In our study, all three patients in the RTX group who experienced relapse showed B-cell reconstitution at the time of disease recurrence. Following retreatment with rituximab, B-cell depletion was reinduced, leading to a subsequent remission. However, not all responders with restored B-cells experienced disease relapse; Patient 4 and Patient 7 achieved long-term remission with just one or two doses of RTX. This might be attributed to the complete and durable elimination of the potential autoreactive clones. Such a mechanism aligns with the sustained remission observed following rituximab therapy in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, where depletion of nephritogenic autoantibodies persists even after the reconstitution of circulating B lymphocytes. Additional mechanisms involved interactions with T cells and direct effects on podocytes, as outlined in previous discussions.

As regards associations, it was packed cell volume (PCV) only that showed significant association with histological types. Patients with FSGS had lower hematocrit levels compared to the other common histological types – MPGN and MCD (P = 0.01). Creatinine levels although more elevated in children with FSGS failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.05) (Table 2).

### Deep learning-based histopathological assessment of tubulo-interstitial injury in chronic kidney diseases [^97fac803]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We observed a distinct correlation between the inflammatory cell infiltration score from DLRS and CKD severity, as indicated by eGFR at the time of biopsy (Fig. 5 b). In response to renal injury, multiple processes are involved: secretion of cytokines and chemokines, initiation of repair mechanisms, and activation of profibrotic cells. While this regulated response aims to facilitate tissue regeneration, defective or prolonged signaling from inflammatory and fibrogenic cells can lead to fibrosis. Conversely, the presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the early stages can mitigate the impact of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation, such as the inflammatory cell infiltration score, could be vital for selecting appropriate treatments in the future.

Previous research has extensively studied interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial cell infiltration to assess pathological changes and renal outcomes in DN or benign nephrosclerosis –. Tubules connected to a damaged glomerulus shrink and are replaced by fibrotic interstitium, leading to reduced GFR. Such replacement also occurs in injured tubules, regardless of their associated glomerular condition. Therefore, scoring the extent of interstitial changes might be a more accurate indicator of nephron unit injury than assessing glomerular sclerosis alone. Indeed, the interstitial fibrosis score from DLRS showed a strong correlation with renal function (eGFR) at the time of biopsy, suggesting its reliability as an indicator of renal function, even without a direct assessment of glomerular sclerosis.

### Simultaneous clinical resolution of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab [^836733cb]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although renal involvement in advanced haematological malignancies is common, glomerulonephritis associated with lymphoproliferative disorders is rare, and the related pathogenetic mechanisms are still poorly understood. We present a rare case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia(CLL)-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Case Presentation

A 53-year-old Caucasian man, previously healthy, with no history of hypertension, alcohol use or smoking presented with rapid weight gain, massive peripheral oedema, and hypertension. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 49,800 cells/mm3 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 47,000 cells/mm3, serum albumin of 2.3 g/dL, urea 65 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. A 24-hour urine collection contained 7.1 g protein and significant haematuria. A peripheral blood smear showed mature lymphocytosis and smudge cells. Diagnostic imaging showed mild paraaortic lymphadenopathy with no renal abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed diffuse and focal infiltration with B-CLL lymphocytes. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed total sclerosis in 3/21(14%) of the glomeruli and focal and segmental solidification and sclerosis in 4/21 (19%) glomeruli. A regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab was successful in inducing remission of the CLL and clinical resolution of the nephritic-range proteinuria.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to monitor both the malignancy and the glomerular lesions is crucial for the optimal management of paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis. Although chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab successfully treated CLL-associated nephrotic syndrome in our patient, further studies are required to confirm efficacy in this setting.

### Protective effects of L-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) in proximal tubular cells against glomerular injury in Anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis [^4471d901]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In glomerulonephritis (GN), an overload of free fatty acids (FFA) bound to albumin in urinary protein may induce oxidative stress in the proximal tubules. Human liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (hL-FABP) expressed in human proximal tubules, but not rodents, participates in intracellular FFA metabolism and exerts anti-oxidative effects on the progression of tubulointerstitial damage. We examined whether tubular enhancement of this anti-oxidative action modulates the progression of glomerular damage in immune-mediated GN in hL-FABP chromosomal gene transgenic (Tg) mice.

Methods

Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN) was induced in Tg and wild-type mice (WT). Proteinuria, histopathology, polymorphonuclear (PMN) influx, expression of tubulointerstitial markers for oxidative stress 4-hydroxy-2-Nonenal (HNE) and fibrosis (α-smooth muscle actin), proximal tubular damage (Kim-1), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPAR γ) and inflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)] were analyzed. The mice were also treated with an angiotensin type II receptor blocker (ARB).

Results

The urinary protein level in Tg mice decreased significantly during the acute phase (~Day 5). Tg mice survived for a significantly longer time than WT mice, with an attenuation of tubulointerstitial damage score and expression of each tubulointerstitial damage marker observed at Day 7. Expression of inflammatory cytokines on Day 7 was higher in WT mice than Tg mice and correlated strongly with PPARγ expression in WT mice, but not in Tg mice. Interestingly, Tg mice showed insufficient PMN influx at 3 and 6 h, with simultaneous elevation of urinary L-FABP and reduction in HNE expression. The two strains of mice showed different types of glomerular damage, with mild mesangial proliferation in Tg mice and severe endothelial swelling with vascular thrombosis in WT mice. The glomerular damage in Tg mice was improved by administration of an ARB.

Conclusions

The present experimental model suggests that tubular enhancement of L-FABP may protect mice with anti-GBM GN from progression of both tubulointerstitial and glomerular injury.

### The pathology of tubulointerstitial kidney disease: a clinicopathologic approach to narrowing the differential diagnosis [^14c17211]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Tubulointerstitial kidney disease can be recognized histologically as tubulointerstitial injury that is out of proportion to glomerular or vascular pathology. While recognizable as a histologic entity, determining a more precise underlying etiology for tubulointerstitial disease can be a diagnostic challenge. This review presents a clinicopathologic approach intended to help nephrologists and pathologists narrow the clinical differential diagnosis of tubulointerstitial disease. Inflammatory tubulointerstitial disease can often be subcategorized based on the presence of specific types of inflammatory infiltrates, such as eosinophils, neutrophils or granulomas. Recognition of these inflammatory phenotypes raises and lowers some entities in the differential diagnosis. Broadly speaking, underlying causes of inflammatory tubulointerstitial disease include drug reaction, infection, and autoimmune diseases. The most common causes of acute noninflammatory tubulointerstitial disease are ischemic and toxic tubular injuries. Much of the time there is substantial overlap in the morphology of ischemic and toxic tubular injury, but there are distinctive findings in noninflammatory tubulointerstitial disease, including casts and crystals, that may allow for a more specific histologic diagnosis that maps to a narrower clinical differential diagnosis. Ultimately, understanding the root cause of tubulointerstitial disease requires careful integration of clinical history with histopathologic findings.

### Spot urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable estimate of 24-hour proteinuria in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy, but not membranous nephropathy [^bbc9e8bc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient population

The study participants included 161 patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), minimal change disease (MCD), or membranous nephropathy –nephrotic syndrome (MN-NS) and who were diagnosed through kidney biopsy at the Jikei University Kashiwa Hospital and Kanagawa Prefecture Shiomidai Hospital between 2008 and 2015.

Patients with diabetes mellitus or taking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors were excluded, because the amount of proteinuria could be influenced by the treatments of underlying disease.

Data collection

Clinical and laboratory information

Data on baseline demographics and clinical and laboratory data were reviewed prior to renal biopsy. Age, sex, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body surface area were obtained from each medical chart. Serum creatinine (Cr) levels were measured by routine methods (enzyme assay; CRE-II, Kainos Laboratory Inc. Tokyo, Japan) at each hospital. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is expressed using the following formula: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 194 × Cr⁻¹.⁰⁹⁴ × age⁻⁰.²⁸⁷ (× 0.739, if female) prepared by the Japanese Society of Nephrology.

All participants were given explanations on the use of the device for proportionally collectable urine at a rate of 1/50 (Urine-MateP R, Sumitomo Bekelite, Tokyo, Japan) for each voiding for 24 h. Casual spot urine was obtained in the morning of the same day after a patient carried out collection of 24-h urine. Urinary concentration of protein and Cr were measured by Japan Electron Optics Laboratory autoanalyzer, Tokyo, Japan.

Histopathological diagnosis

All kidney tissue specimens were obtained via percutaneous needle biopsies. All specimens were examined using light microscopy; immunohistochemistry, including staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q; and electron microscopy.

IgAN was diagnosed based on light microscopic findings of mesangial proliferative changes, immunofluorescence findings of mesangial IgA and C3 deposition, and electron microscopic findings of electron-dense deposits in the mesangial area.

No abnormalities of kidney tissue on light microscopy were found in patients with MCD. However, podocyte damage was found on electron microscopy.

In MN-NS, diagnostic features included capillary wall thickening, normal cellularity, IgG and C3 found along the capillary walls upon immunofluorescence, and subepithelial deposits visible on electron microscopy.

There were no patients with the pathological features of diabetic nephropathy.

### Methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab (MATRix) chemoimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma: a toronto experience [^5ecf0f21]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

The MATRix (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa, rituximab) regimen has significantly improved outcomes of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The original trial population, however, was young and fit with few comorbidities. We show that, in a real-world setting, the majority of patients treated with MATRix experienced hematologic toxicity, and 65% of patients developed grade 3 or 4 infectious complications. Dose reductions were made in 68% of patients and dose delays occurred in 49% of patients. Survival was comparable to what has been reported in the literature, but the rate of toxicity was higher than previously described.

The randomized International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group trial IELSG32 examined outcomes of MATRix followed by consolidation therapy with either autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or whole brain radiation in patients with PCNSL. The addition of thiotepa to MATRix had prolonged both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), producing sustained improved outcomes with a 7-year PFS of 50% and an OS of 70%. The IELSG32 trial population was a young and fit population, with a median age of 57 years and the majority of patients (67%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1. One retrospective multicenter analysis documented poorer outcomes in a population with poorer performance status. We therefore set out to examine the use of MATRix as an induction regimen in a real-world clinical setting in Toronto, Canada.

We performed a retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of B-cell PCNSL treated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and St. Michael's Hospital from October 2017 to March 2020. Exclusion criteria included positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus, or systemic lymphoma. A review of electronic health records was performed to retrieve the patients' baseline characteristics, medical history, and treatment details including dose intensity, timing, and response to therapy. For patients deemed eligible for ASCT, induction with MATRix was given at any of the three hospitals, but ASCT was only performed at one center. As such, patients were often seen for transplant later in their treatment course. The local practice evolved to omit thiotepa from the third cycle to allow for improved stem cell collection off the third or fourth cycle. All other dose adjustments were made at the treating physician's discretion.

### Pathological and clinical characteristics of late-onset oligomeganephronia based on a histomorphometric study [^b5d18606]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oligomeganephronia (OMN), which is also called oligomeganephronic renal hypoplasia, is conditionally defined as a rare type of renal hypoplasia characterized by small kidneys with reduced number of renal lobes mainly occurs in infants or children. Histologically, it shows a strikingly reduced number of nephrons which are markedly enlarged. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by renal biopsy. So far, only a few reports can be obtained and most of them consist of case reports or small case series. In the only large series by Broyer et al. a rigorous diagnostic criteria were suggested as follows. (i) Reduction of kidney size with the sum of both kidney lengths ≤ 80% of 1 kidney of the same-sized child. (ii) Reduction in glomerular filtration rate to 30% of normal. (iii) Absence of urinary tract malformations and no evidence of significant vesicoureteral reflux (small amounts of reflux were accepted provided no scars were identified). Since such a strict standard is difficult to meet in practice, many reports have employed far more loose criteria. In contrast to the above traditional early-onset OMN, similar pathological changes can occur in adults which is called late-onset OMN. As far as we know, there are only seven adult patients with OMN in English-published literature, presenting different features from the traditional OMN patients in children. Moreover, the pathological diagnosis of late-onset OMN is still controversial due to the lack of definite quantitative criteria. In this study, by analyzing the data from the control patients of thin basement membrane nephropathy, we try to establish quantitative criteria for glomerular hypertrophy and rarity based on histomorphometric study. Using this standard, cases suspicious of late-onset OMN during the past ten years in our center were reassessed and seven of them were eventually diagnosed. Subsequently, the clinical and pathological manifestations of these patients were presented and the difference between early-onset and late-onset OMN were compared with literature review.

### Polyclonal immunoglobulin G deposits with distinctive appearance in the tubular basement membrane: a report of two cases [^4cece4ea]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tubulointerstitial diseases can develop in a wide range of clinical settings, including infections, adverse drug reactions, autoimmune conditions, exposure to toxins, obstructive uropathies such as hydronephrosis and reflux nephropathy, metabolic disorders, hematologic malignancies, glomerular diseases, and vascular-related conditions such as hypertension. These disorders are typically associated with mild proteinuria and minimal urinary sediment abnormalities, with either acute or chronic compromise of renal function. Clinically, tubulointerstitial injury may be indicated by elevated levels of urinary β2-microglobulin (β2 MG) or Nacetylβ-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), along with unexplained increases in serum creatinine (Cr). Renal biopsy plays an essential role in diagnosis, allowing assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) and complement component deposition patterns, either linear or granular, on immunofluorescence — as well as TBM deposits observed using electron microscopy. These assessments assist in reaching diagnostic conclusions. In this report, we describe two atypical cases showing polyclonal IgG deposits within thickened TBM and minimal interstitial inflammation, which do not fit established categories of tubulointerstitial diseases.

### Belinostat (Beleodaq) [^76bb73e1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the single-arm trial, 48% of patients (N = 62) were ≥ 65 years of age and 10% of patients (N = 13) were ≥ 75 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The median age of the trial population was 63 years. Patients ≥ 65 years of age had a higher response rate to Beleodaq treatment than patients < 65 years of age (36% versus 16%) while no meaningful differences in response rate were observed between patients ≥ 75 years of age and those < 75 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in serious adverse reactions were observed in patients based on age (< 65 years compared with ≥ 65 years or < 75 years of age compared with ≥ 75 years of age).

8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, any AST). Reduce the Beleodaq dosage in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN, any AST) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Avoid use of Beleodaq in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, any AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Belinostat is metabolized in the liver, moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN, any AST) and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, any AST) increases belinostat exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of Beleodaq adverse reactions.

8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to < 90 mL/min). Reduce the Beleodaq dosage in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 60 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Avoid use of Beleodaq in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min).

Moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 60 mL/min) increases belinostat exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of Beleodaq adverse reactions. The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) on belinostat pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 is related to pathologic involvement in IgA nephropathy with normotension, normal renal function and mild proteinuria [^16c4284d]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Oxford classification is the first specially-designed pathological system for evaluating the prognosis of IgAN. Among all 4 variables, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis has been indicated to have the most predictive value by different validation studies. In the current study, the patients with elevated urinary KIM-1 had more severe tubulointerstitial injury (5/18 patients with elevated urinary KIM-1 had T1 score, while no patient with normal urinary KIM-1 had T1 score). Although no difference of the response to treatment between patients with and without elevated urinary KIM-1 was observed during a short-term follow-up, it seems that the long-term prognosis of the patients with elevated urinary KIM-1 should be paid more attention.

Although KIM-1 is a sensitive and specific biomarker for the tubulointerstitial damage, elevated urinary KIM-1 can be observed not only in the kidney diseases characterized mainly by tubulointerstitial damage, but also in that characterized exclusively by globular damage (such as minimal change disease). In these diseases, tubulointerstitial damage should be due to reabsorption of protein. So urinary KIM-1 is a marker of the disease activity, however when tubules and interstitium are extremely damaged, KIM-1 will disappear. In the current study, significant correlation between urinary KIM-1 and crescent formation was found in patients with mild IgAN. Previous studies indicated more than 20% of IgAN patients could be found to have crescents on the initial biopsy. Poor prognosis of crescentic IgAN has been generally recognized by clinicians. Coexistence of the cellular, fibrocellular and fibrous crescents reflects the process of slow progression of IgAN. Although crescent formation was not demonstrated to be an independent risk factor of ESRD in the Oxford classification, the significance of crescent formation in IgAN should not be neglected, because patients with rapidly progressive kidney failure were excluded when developing the Oxford classification.

### Different renal manifestations associated with very early onset pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: case report and review of literature [^9adee873]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Review of the literature

Table 1 summarizes the main literature reporting renal histology in patients affected by IBD. Overall, in accordance with the first report by Hubert et al. in 1984, following studies confirmed IgA nephropathy as the most common type of histological diagnosis. Few patients had granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis that, at the time, were correlated with the exposure to aminosalicylate, but a clear pathological mechanism was not proposed. To the best of our knowledge, a relapse of renal manifestation, characterized by dual renal pathology, has never been previously reported.

The evidence for rituximab's efficacy in FSGS is more limited, originating mostly from small case series. In addition, the total number of patients included with (primary) FSGS has been restricted. Remission rates are lower in comparison to MCD. The underlying pathology of FSGS might be related to secondary causes rather than primary disease in some case series where individuals with secondary FSGS likely were included, substantiated by limited FPE on electron microscopy in some cases, with a mean serum creatinine of 2.6 mg/dl at baseline and a mean age of 64 years. The best current evidence stems from a multi-center study from Italy reporting on 31 patients with (primary) FSGS, of whom 18 (58%) had SD and 11 (35%) had SR disease. Response to therapy, defined as reduction of proteinuria to < 3.5 g/d and at least to < 50% from baseline was achieved in 45% and 43% at 6 and 12 months, when patients retreated with rituximab were included in the analysis. Independent predictors of response were steroid-dependence as indication and a proteinuria less than 5 g at baseline. This again indicates that those not responding to glucocorticoids and to other immunosuppressive measures such as calcineurin inhibitors are less likely to achieve a therapeutic response to rituximab. The onset of nephrotic syndrome in such cases might be due to a genetic variant or is secondary to other triggers rather than having a primary underlying causative factor potentially amenable to immunosuppression. In addition, several studies, a majority conducted in a pediatric population, evaluated other predictors of response in patients who received rituximab (Table 2). In a cohort of 22 consecutive patients with FSGS, T-cell activation markers were evaluated before administration of rituximab. Recovery of CD154 + CD4 + CD3 +, interferon-gamma + CD3 +, and IL2 + CD3 + T cells 6 months after the treatment predicted the response. In 102 children or young adults, higher levels of circulating levels of memory B cells at the time of rituximab administration were associated with relapse risk after therapy. Proteinuria selectivity index (PSI), which is the ratio between the urinary clearance of IgG to transferrin is a predictor of steroid response in nephrotic syndrome, and a value of ≤ 0.20 has been related to higher remission rates. In a study of 29 adult patients (15 MCD and 14 FSGS) who were treated with rituximab, all patients with PSI ≤ 0.20 attained remission while no patients with PSI > 0.20 did. Responses to previous glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents were lower in the PSI > 0.20 group, and most of these patients suffered from FSGS. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is one proposed circulating factor. A study focusing on patients with resistant FSGS and higher suPAR (> 3500 pg/ml) levels did not find a benefit from rituximab administration, but it should be kept in mind that steroid-resistant patients, as mentioned above, are in general non-responsive to several lines of immunosuppression and unlikely have a primary FSGS form.

### Efficacy of CD19-guided B-cell depletion with rituximab plus steroids in refractory focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [^3f7cb85b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, its retrospective design inherently carried risks of selection bias and unmeasured confounding factors, despite efforts to match baseline characteristics. Second, the modest sample size limited statistical power for subgroup analyses and might obscure subtle efficacy differences. Third, heterogeneity in RTX dosing regimens and retreatment schedules complicated protocol standardization. While tailored dosing optimized B-cell depletion, it precluded definitive dose-response conclusions. Future prospective trials with protocolized dosing and extended surveillance are needed to address these gaps. Further limitations included the absence of a genetic testing for FSGS. Although we excluded familial FSGS, the absence of systematic genetic testing and standardized etiological workup prevented precise subtyping. This heterogeneity is an inherent limitation of retrospective FSGS cohorts.

In conclusion, RTX demonstrated comparable short-term efficacy to conventional immunosuppressants, achieving similar rates of complete remission and overall response. Crucially, RTX was associated with a significantly lower relapse rate and a trend towards longer relapse-free survival compared to conventional therapy. We advocate for individualized RTX integration into therapeutic sequences, guided by B-cell monitoring, while advocating for larger prospective studies to standardize protocols and validate predictive biomarkers.

Prognosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) — risk assessment criteria and antibody dynamics: Practice Point 3.2.1 states to use clinical and laboratory criteria to assess the risk of progressive loss of kidney function. Risk stratification has historically relied on the degree of proteinuria, eGFR at the time of kidney biopsy, and irreversible histologic damage such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and traditional risk factors include kidney function (estimated by Scr), urinary protein excretion, and serum albumin. A decrease in anti-PLA2R antibody levels predicted a decline in proteinuria by 6 or more months, spontaneous remission rates are highest among patients with low anti-PLA2R antibody levels and the opposite is true for those with severely elevated antibody titers, and the commentary emphasizes antibody trajectory rather than an arbitrary threshold (> 50 RU/ml) for risk assessment.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^4ddbb536]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy diagnosis — anti-PLA2R antibody and kidney biopsy. Practice Point 3.1.1: A kidney biopsy is not required to confirm the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) in patients with nephrotic syndrome and a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test. There are currently insufficient data to support the use of anti-THSD7A antibody as a diagnostic biomarker for MN in lieu of a biopsy. In a meta-analysis of 9 studies including 710 patients with MN and 1502 controls, the sensitivity of a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test for the diagnosis of MN was 0.78 and specificity 0.99; a recent single-center study reported sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 99%, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for specificity is 0.96 to 1.0, which is comparable to the diagnostic performance of kidney biopsy. The added value of biopsy among anti-PLA2R–positive patients without secondary causes was studied in 97 patients, in whom the primary diagnosis in all biopsies was MN. Among 60 patients with baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, only 2 had superimposed diabetic nephropathy or FSGS and these findings did not affect care; among 37 patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, additional findings were reported in 5 patients including acute interstitial nephritis (n = 1), diabetic nephropathy (n = 1), and FSGS (n = 2) with cellular crescents (n = 1). Thus, a kidney biopsy should be considered when there are indications for purposes other than establishing a diagnosis of MN in patients who are anti-PLA2R antibody–positive.

Therefore, a significant negative correlation exists between the progression of glomerular grading and the exacerbation of renal anemia. Glomerular grading demonstrated a significant negative correlation with urinary specific gravity and urine osmolality, indicating that more severe glomerular injury is associated with lower specific gravity and osmolality. This result is likely due to glomerular injury frequently leading to tubulointerstitial damage, which decreases tubular concentrating capacity and lowers urinary specific gravity and osmolality.

Tubulointerstitial lesions exhibited a significant positive correlation with blood creatinine and a significant negative correlation with GFR, reflecting the close association between tubulointerstitial lesions and renal function. Damage to the tubulointerstitial stroma affects the filtration and excretory functions of the kidneys, resulting in a weakened ability to filter waste products, such as creatinine, leading to their accumulation in the body, elevated blood creatinine levels, and decreased renal function. The positive correlation between tubulointerstitial lesions and blood uric acid may be attributed to hyperuricemia causing vascular and tubulointerstitial damage by activating the renin-angiotensin system and immune system response.

Furthermore, tubulointerstitial lesions can hinder uric acid excretion, contributing to secondary hyperuricemia.

Vitrification of renal arterioles was positively correlated with age and blood creatinine levels, and negatively correlated with urine osmolality and GFR. Physiological aging of blood vessels accelerates the vitrification of renal arterioles with increasing age. Diabetes-induced vitrification of renal arterioles reduces vascular elasticity, affecting renal blood supply and disrupting kidney filtration function, resulting in decreased GFR and impaired creatinine removal from the blood. The severity of renal arteriolar vitrification is negatively correlated with urine osmolality due to ischemic damage to glomeruli and tubules associated with the diseased arterioles. Consequently, the concentrating and reabsorbing functions of both distal and proximal tubules are impaired, resulting in decreased urine osmolality and increased nocturia.

Renal vascular atherosclerosis is positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with GFR. Renal vascular sclerosis may be part of systemic arteriosclerosis, affecting multiple organ blood supply and function, including the glomeruli. Increased renal vascular atherosclerosis severity is more likely to cause renal artery narrowing, leading to renal ischemia, glomerular atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis, thereby reducing GFR.

### Case report: anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease with normal renal function [^c0df9d64]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This case of anti-GBM disease demonstrated the following three points. First, she had anti-GBM disease with normal kidney function. Second, VUR with bladder dysfunction may have been the cause. Third, DFPP is an effective treatment for anti-GBM disease with normal kidney function.

Anti-GBM disease remains a very uncommon condition in the pediatric population. We identified only 23 cases published in English literature over a 25-year span. Anti-GBM disease has an estimated frequency of 0.5–1 case per million inhabitants/year, according to a series published in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and Scandinavia. We described the case of an 8-year-old girl with only minimal renal involvement and no pulmonary symptoms.

Symptoms of nephritis often exhibit a clinical picture of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; however, to date, several cases of anti-GBM disease with normal kidney function have been reported. The prevalence is approximately 3–36%. Systemic symptoms (i.e. malaise, fever, or weight loss) were less common in patients with normal renal function than in those with renal impairment. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies were detected less often and at lower levels in individuals with normal renal function than in those with renal impairment. The histological abnormalities were not as marked in patients with normal renal function compared to those with renal impairment. The IgG subclasses for the distribution of natural autoantibodies were restricted to IgG2 (100%) and IgG4 (100%), whereas in patients, it was mainly IgG1 (93.8%) and IgG4 (90.6%). Different IgG subclasses have different biological properties. For example, IgG4, unlike IgG1, does not efficiently bind to C1q; therefore, it does not activate the classical pathway of the complement. In addition, the IgG Fc receptors on mononuclear macrophage poorly bind to IgG4. Thus, IgG4 is unlikely to trigger severe inflammatory damage to the glomeruli. Previously, we observed anti-GBM antibodies in patients with mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level, < 300 mmol/L) that were predominantly of the IgG4 subclasses (75%), which supports the speculation that IgG subclasses of anti-GBM antibodies may be associated with different clinical presentations and disease progression. Additionally, since a school urine screening system is widespread in Japan, it was possible to discover this condition early in our case.

### Lithium [^33557676]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Lithium-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease

The predominant form of chronic renal disease associated with long-term lithium treatment is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (CTIN). The biopsy findings in patients with lithium induced CTIN include tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli, tubular dilation, and nephron atrophy with cyst formation. The relationship between renal function and morphologic changes and their association with lithium treatment has not been established. CTIN patients might present with nephrotic proteinuria (> 3.0g/dL), worsening renal insufficiency and/or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Postmarketing cases consistent with nephrotic syndrome in patients with or without CTIN have also been reported. The biopsy findings in patients with nephrotic syndrome include minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The discontinuation of lithium in patients with nephrotic syndrome has resulted in remission of nephrotic syndrome.

Kidney function should be assessed prior to and during lithium treatment. Routine urinalysis and other tests may be used to evaluate tubular function (e.g., urine specific gravity or osmolality following a period of water deprivation, or 24-hour urine volume) and glomerular function (e.g., serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, or proteinuria). During lithium treatment, progressive or sudden changes in renal function, even within the normal range, indicate the need for re-evaluation of treatment.

5.5 Encephalopathic Syndrome

An encephalopathic syndrome, characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN and fasting blood glucose, has occurred in patients treated with lithium and an antipsychotic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Because of a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined treatment should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurological toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

### Case report: anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease with normal renal function [^abcd4951]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

In a previous nationwide survey in Japan, the prognosis was 80% for anti-GBM type nephritis and 60% for Goodpasture syndrome, and the renal prognosis was 50% for anti-GBM type nephritis and 40% for Goodpasture syndrome. Prognosis seems to worsen if the patient is oliguric at presentation, if the serum creatinine is > 600 μmol/L (6.8 mg/dL), or if there is > 50% crescent formation of the glomeruli. Disease recurrence with antibody production has been reported, but it is quite rare.

We reported on a pediatric case of anti-GBM disease with normal renal function. Because of the school urine screening program, it was discovered at an early stage. Direct damage to the kidney due to VUR is considered the etiology in the current case. It is interesting that in a case with renal failure due to reflux nephropathy with VUR, anti-GBM antibody is produced. We think that the accumulation of similar cases will help elucidate the pathology of anti-GBM disease in children.

### Rituximab for minimal change disease in adults: long-term follow-up [^88ae3e7d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Minimal change nephropathy or disease (MCD) accounts for 10–15% of cases of the nephrotic syndrome in adults with frequent relapses occurring in up to 25% of cases. The drug of choice is glucocorticoids (GCs), but GC-dependence is seen in 25–30%. Treatment with rituximab has been found to be effective in relapsing and GC-dependent cases, but little data are available regarding long-term outcome in adults.

Patients

We present nine female and seven male patients, ranging from 19 to 73 years of age with multirelapsing, GC-dependent or GC-resistant disease with a kidney biopsy consistent with MCD. Twelve patients were steroid-dependent with a lowest daily GC dose between 5 and 20 mg/day.

Treatment and Outcomes

Rituximab with a total dose 1000–2800 mg divided in two to four doses was given together with GC achieving B-cell depletion before the second dose. No major side-effects occurred. Thirteen of the patients responded with complete remission enabling discontinuation or tapering of GC significantly below levels, where relapses had occurred in the past (P < 0.001). Two patients reached partial remission and one had no response to therapy. Follow-up was 12–70 months (median 44). Eight patients have remained in remission, whereas relapses occurred in seven patients after 9–28 months with repeated rituximab treatment in four of these.

Conclusions

Our study reinforces the role of rituximab as a GC-sparing agent in the challenging GC-dependent and multirelapsing MCD patients. In this emerging therapeutic field randomized studies with extended follow-up will add important information regarding optimal treatment, relapse and safety.

### Urinary soluble urokinase receptor levels are elevated and pathogenic in patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [^c1ef9ace]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which was first described by Rich in an autopsy series, is defined as a clinico-pathological syndrome manifesting with proteinuria, usually of nephrotic range, and pathological lesions of focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis and diffuse foot-process effacement. FSGS is divided into either primary form (without known cause) or secondary to other kidney injuries, such as genetic variations, increased intra-glomerular pressures, reflux disease, viruses, drug toxicity and so on. For primary FSGS, the etiology and pathogenesis have not been well elucidated, but the damage and detachment of podocytes from the glomerular basement membrane are regarded as the key in the initiation and progression of FSGS. Previous studies have reported that secondary FSGS caused by genetic mutation usually did not recur following kidney transplantation, but in some patients with primary FSGS, it may recur within hours after kidney transplantation. Some patients with primary FSGS were successfully treated with plasmapheresis or immunoabsorption, and a circulating permeability factor has been proposed in those patients. Recently, Wei et al. found that soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) might be the most likely causative circulating factor for primary FSGS. Our previous study also revealed that elevated plasma suPAR might be specific for some patients with primary FSGS. Other studies, however, have indicated that plasma suPAR might not be a specific marker for primary or idiopathic FSGS and that it is unlikely to be the leading cause of childhood primary FSGS. A recent study suggested that the urinary suPAR level might be a better biomarker than the plasma suPAR level in predicting the recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Our current study measured the urinary suPAR level in a variety of primary glomerular diseases, including primary FSGS with various pathological variants; we also analyzed its clinical significance and further investigated the possible pathogenic role of urinary suPAR in patients with primary FSGS.

### The importance of a multidisciplinary approach in two tricky cases: the perfect match for Fabry disease [^a8c91e3f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Biochemical and molecular analyses are essential to identify cases of AFD, but sometimes the results can be inconclusive, prompting the use of histological evaluations to help the diagnosis. Kidney biopsy is a cornerstone in nephrology for diagnosing renal diseases and guiding treatment decisions. With advancements in radiological guidance, renal biopsy has become a safe and routine procedure. Although genetic testing is widely available for the diagnosis of AFD, kidney biopsy remains a valuable tool, especially in complex genetic cases, such as variants of unknown significance (VUS) or non-coding GLA variants that are not routinely included in standard diagnostic protocols. Recent studies have examined the actual pathogenic effects of non-coding mutations, demonstrating that they can have an impact similar to pathogenic variants occurring in coding regions. These mutations may directly alter the enzyme's peptide sequence, structure, and function, thereby contributing to disease pathogenesis. However, even in these cases the utility of kidney biopsies continues to be a subject of debate.

Histological findings, as widely described in the literature, provide valuable insights into the severity of renal involvement, often revealing subclinical damage and response to treatment. Studies by the International Study Group of Fabry Nephropathy (ISGFN) underscore the utility of kidney biopsy as part of the baseline assessment of the AFD nephropathy. The real chronicity status pointed out by glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and arteriolar hyalinosis, was detected even in patients at incipient stages with minimal or absent proteinuria. These findings suggest that histological renal involvement precedes overt clinical signs, highlighting the value of early detection.

All observed structures exhibit lipid inclusions and show early stages of sclerosis, even in patients with non-classical mutations and VUS. Fibrosis, as observed in other chronic diseases, represents the final stage of tissue damage; however, few studies have investigated the pathogenesis of fibrosis in AFD nephropathy. The deposition of Gb3 in various renal cell types triggers biological processes that induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote fibroblast proliferation. At present, kidney biopsy remains the only reliable method to assess the degree of kidney fibrosis, unlike other organs such as the heart and brain, where innovative imaging techniques provide sensitive evaluations of fibrosis. It is well-established that fibrosis can limit the therapeutic response to ERT. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Additionally, confocal microscopy studies using fluorescent mouse monoclonal anti-Gb3 antibodies can be applied to biopsy specimens to confirm Gb3 deposits in ambiguous cases.

### Global dimensions of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu): a modern era environmental and / or occupational nephropathy? [^bd8c39c8]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Few studies have reported on urinary findings in CKDu patients. However, in described clinical presentations, typical patients present with a bland urine sediment and minimal proteinuria (Table 1). Recent studies have measured levels of kidney early biological effect markers in urine. The results are consistent with proximal tubular damage and may be useful in future work to identify CKDu at earlier stages and to determine etiology. Information on renal pathology has also been very limited to date. The two studies reporting biopsy results from patients with CKDu in El Salvador both found interstitial fibrosis with varying degrees of tubular atrophy, essentially proportional to stage of CKD. Both series also reported non-specific glomerular damage. Whether this is secondary to a primary tubulointerstitial process or represents a primary glomerular disease or could be due to recurrent ischemia of the glomerular capillaries, such as from dehydration or concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), remains unknown. Wijkström et al. concluded that the biopsy results from Central America did not resemble any other common kidney disease. Importantly, these findings are similar to those described in CKDu from Sri Lanka. It would be very useful to have additional information on pathology, including at earlier stages of the disease process.

### A cross-sectional study on the relationship between hematological data and quantitative morphological indices from kidney biopsies in different glomerular diseases [^dbce3f38]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of the kidney biopsy into nephrology by Niels Alwall in 1944, and then by Iversen and Brun in 1951, greatly modified the kidney histopathology classification, which was already started in 1914. Since then, great attention was devoted to the interpretation of kidney biopsies, participating in the identification of nephrology as a subspeciality around 1960.

More than 50 years after its invention, the kidney biopsy remains the cornerstone for the classification of vascular/tubule-interstitial nephropathies, and of glomerulopathies, but it is still based on subjective, semiquantitative scores. Unfortunately, since the introduction of the bioptic technique by its inventors, no great advancements have been made to overcome these limitations.

The need for such advancements stems from the fracture between histological features and clinical data: indeed, advanced kidney lesions may be accompanied by a paucity of clinical impairment and, conversely, important clinical syndromes (e.g. nephrotic syndrome) may be accompanied by irrelevant histological findings (e.g. minimal change disease).

This clinical-morphological divergence might underpin a limited ability of clinical/hematological tests to identify renal damage or an, as yet, suboptimal method for the quantification of the renal damage. Ideally, we would need a semi-automatic analysis system of kidney biopsies, with high reproducibility and precision, correlated to the clinical data, the urine sediment data and the ultrasound imaging data; it would be also desirable that these data give information about the prognosis and the therapeutical response (Fig. 1a).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^f9b81a18]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Living Kidney Donor Work Group — thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) in potential donors is described with small series and short-term outcomes. Epidemiological studies of TBMN suggest increased risks of hypertension and proteinuria compared with the general population over time, but progression to ESKD is rare and thought to require an additional insult. In a US series of 512 consecutive donors, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria for at least 1 month was identified in 2.7% (n = 14); hematuria resolved after treatment for urinary tract infection in 1. Among those biopsied (10/12), findings included TBMN (5/12), normal (2/12), nonhomogeneous basement membrane abnormalities (1/12), and IgA nephropathy (1/12), with greater than 20% glomerulosclerosis reported in one patient. Two of the 4 with TBMN, aged 44 and 53 years, proceeded with donation and after 15 months follow-up donors were free of hypertension and proteinuria and recipients had "excellent" graft function. A Korean series of 5 living donors with TBMN on pre-donation biopsy reported mean serum creatinine 0.94 ± 0.32 mg/dL (83 ± 28.3 μmol/L) and no new-onset hypertension or proteinuria over a mean follow-up of 34.7 ± 42.5 months.

### Pathophysiology of tubulointerstitial nephritis [^d12665d3]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) encompasses a wide range of kidney disease. It represents the final common pathophysiological pathway from a variety of diverse insults leading to sterile cellular infiltrate, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. In this article, we approach the development of ATIN from an immunological lens and explore how it relates to epithelial cell healing and fibrosis. The role of intrinsic and extrinsic insults such as damage associated molecular patterns and pathogen associated molecular patterns and their activation of deleterious inflammatory pathways are also discussed. Additionally, specific drug, metabolic and environmental causes and mechanisms are reviewed. While ATIN is an expansive topic, taking this approach to study kidney inflammation, healing and fibrosis will provide a uniform scaffold for understanding this complex and diverse set of diseases.

### The evolving role of rituximab in adult minimal change glomerulopathy [^2d33c591]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Minimal-change glomerulopathy is defined histologically by the presence of normal glomeruli on light microscopy and diffuse podocyte effacement on electron microscopy. Although effective in children, corticosteroid treatment in adults is more variable and time to response can be prolonged. Data to support rituximab use in adults with corticosteroid-dependent or resistant minimal-change glomerulopathy are limited. Here, we describe the clinical course of adults with corticosteroid-dependent or -resistant minimal-change glomerulopathy who received rituximab.

Methods

Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed from all adult patients with native kidney, biopsy-proven, minimal-change glomerulopathy who were administered rituximab between 2009 and 2014 and cared for at the UNC Kidney Center.

Results

Ten patients with corticosteroid-resistant (n = 5) or corticosteroid-dependent (n = 5) idiopathic minimal-change glomerulopathy were treated with rituximab between 2009 and 2014. Rituximab treatment induced remission in all 10 patients with a median time to remission of 2 months. The median time from rituximab to corticosteroid discontinuation was 3.5 months. The median remission time was 29 months and follow-up time was 39.5 months. No serious adverse events attributable to rituximab were observed.

Conclusion

Rituximab induced remission in all patients with corticosteroid-dependent or -resistant minimal-change glomerulopathy, and may hold great therapeutic potential with good efficacy and minimal toxicity. Mounting evidence implies that a well-conducted randomized controlled clinical trial using rituximab in adults with minimal-change glomerulopathy in both corticosteroid-resistant and corticosteroid-dependent patients is warranted.

### The sialoadhesin (CD169) expressing a macrophage subset in human proliferative glomerulonephritis [^76e91f72]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Sialoadhesin (Sn; CD169) is a lectin-like receptor whose expression is restricted to subsets of tissue and inflammatory macrophages. We have previously identified accumulation of Sn+ macrophages as an important marker of disease progression versus remission in rat mesangial proliferative nephritis. The current study examined the significance of Sn+ macrophages in human proliferative glomerulonephritis.

Methods

Frozen kidney sections from normal adult human kidney (n = 4) and pediatric nephropathy (n = 40) were stained for total macrophages (CD68+ cells), Sn+ macrophages, CD3+ T-cells and collagen type I by immunofluorescence. Leukocyte infiltration and the severity of glomerular lesions and interstitial damage were scored. A second protocol biopsy was performed in 27 cases and clinical and biopsy-based data obtained.

Results

Sn+ macrophages were absent from glomeruli in normal adult human kidney and in thin basement membrane disease (n = 4), but were detected in 4 of 9 cases of purpura nephritis; 7 of 17 IgA nephropathy; 5 of 5 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and 5 of 5 lupus nephritis. Sn+ macrophages were localized in areas of focal glomerular and interstitial damage. Two-colour immunostaining confirmed that Sn+ cells are a subset of total CD68+ macrophages. The number of glomerular Sn+ macrophages correlated with the degree of proteinuria and glomerular lesions (r = 0.44, P = 0.0045 and r = 0.82, P < 0.0001; respectively), while interstitial Sn+ macrophages correlated with the degree of proteinuria and interstitial damage (r = 0.59, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.75, P < 0.0001; respectively). Combined immunostaining revealed that interstitial Sn+ macrophages and CD3+ T-cells co-localized in areas of tubulointerstitial damage with increased type I collagen deposition. There was significant correlation between the number of interstitial Sn+ macrophages and CD3+ T-cells (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001). Most patients responded to a 2 year period of glucocorticoid therapy with a reduction in proteinuria and glomerular lesions and this correlated with the reduction in the number of glomerular Sn+ macrophages.

Conclusion

This study has identified Sn+ cells as a macrophage subset whose accumulation in the kidney correlates with proteinuria and histologic damage. These results, together with recent findings from animal studies, suggest that Sn+ macrophages may play an important role in progressive renal disease.

### Predictors of increase in chronicity index and of kidney function impairment at repeat biopsy in lupus nephritis [^94cfe7a5]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical response at 1 year did not protect from worsening of chronicity index. This is not strikingly surprising, since clinical and histological remissions are often discordant. Furthermore, it is still unknown how long it is needed by an active injury to heal or progress into a chronic lesion. Among the time dependent factors, kidney flares, nephritic flares, were strongly correlated with chronicity index increase. This result confirms a previous report outlining that nephritic flare was associated with a 27-fold risk of doubling creatinine value, compared with patients without flares or with proteinuric flare. Parikh et al added that also the relative duration of kidney exacerbation is an independent predictor of incident and progressive chronic kidney disease. The deleterious influence of kidney exacerbation may possibly be due to the incomplete reversal of the lesions caused by flares despite therapy. The rate of renal flares was not different between patients who received maintenance immunosuppressive therapy and those who did not.

The other purpose of this study was to detect the clinical-histological features associated with KFI in the long term. Patients who received a second biopsy for nephritic flares developed more frequently KFI than those with proteinuric flares and those of protocol group.

We found that features at second biopsy were more predictive than those at first biopsy. At first KB, among clinical and histological features, only the presence of cellular/fibrocellular crescents predicted KFI at univariate analysis. At second biopsy, high serum creatinine, nephrotic syndrome and arterial hypertension predicted KFI. Among the histological features, activity index ≥ 3, moderate/severe cellular/fibrocellular crescents and hyaline deposits, chronicity index > 4, moderate/severe fibrous crescents and interstitial fibrosis were all associated to KFI at univariate analysis. At multivariate analysis, two different histological models with the same power were able to predict KFI. The first model included the association of activity index ≥ 3 with chronicity index > 4, and the second model included the association between moderate-severe cellular/fibrocellular crescents and interstitial fibrosis. When we looked at patients who developed KFI within 5 years of the second KB, we found that both active and chronic lesions at the second biopsy confirmed to be predictors of KFI. In fact, at multivariate analysis, chronicity index > 4 and moderate/severe cellular/fibrocellular crescents at second biopsy were the independent histological predictors of KFI at multivariate analysis.

### The value of repeat kidney biopsy during an atypical course of membranous nephropathy [^3ae3b89f]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This patient's initial presentation was typical of classic primary membranous nephropathy with nephrotic-range proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and venous thromboembolism which corresponded to the classic kidney biopsy findings. However, the sudden and rapid decline in kidney function during a six month observation period, in addition to a newly active urinary sediment, was highly atypical and raised concern for transformation into a crescentic form of membranous nephropathy. There are a growing number of reports of crescentic membranous nephropathy which are typically associated with co-existence of ANCA and anti-GBM disease (repeat serologies for which were negative in this case) and have a variable prognosis with approximately 40% of such patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. However, this case highlights the value in pursuing a repeat kidney biopsy when the course of nephrotic syndrome is atypical as it provided an alternate explanation for this patient's sudden decline – the development of PIGN superimposed upon a background of pre-existing untreated membranous nephropathy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of these two glomerular disease processes.

Among otherwise healthy young adults with PIGN, the need for dialysis is uncommon and the likelihood of complete recovery is high. This may reflect the influence of kidney functional reserve – the ability of the kidneys to hemodynamically adapt during stress to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When this physiologic 'reserve' becomes depleted, the ability of the kidneys to compensate to such a stressor may be diminished. For instance, the course of PIGN is more severe with a lower likelihood of complete recovery in older populations where nephron mass is reduced and among patients with additional concurrent glomerular or tubulointerstital disease. Perhaps the pre-existing kidney damage in these patients heightens the risk for severe acute kidney injury due to an inability to hemodynamically regulate GFR with the added disease stressor of PIGN. In the present case, the co-existing glomerular damage from active and untreated membranous glomerulopathy may have restricted this young patient's ability to maintain adequate GFR with the acute stressor of PIGN and the combination of the two glomerular processes led to severe acute kidney injury requiring dialysis.

### Cyclosporine (cycloSPORINE, modfied) [^7668d7d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ap < 0.05, bp < 0.01, cp < 0.001, dp < 0.0001

A form of a cyclosporine-associated nephropathy is characterized by serial deterioration in renal function and morphologic changes in the kidneys. From 5% to 15% of transplant recipients who have received cyclosporine will fail to show a reduction in rising serum creatinine despite a decrease or discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy. Renal biopsies from these patients will demonstrate one or several of the following alterations: tubular vacuolization, tubular microcalcifications, peritubular capillary congestion, arteriolopathy, and a striped form of interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy. Though none of these morphologic changes is entirely specific, a diagnosis of cyclosporine-associated structural nephrotoxicity requires evidence of these findings.

When considering the development of cyclosporine-associated nephropathy, it is noteworthy that several authors have reported an association between the appearance of interstitial fibrosis and higher cumulative doses or persistently high circulating trough concentrations of cyclosporine. This is particularly true during the first 6 post-transplant months when the dosage tends to be highest and when, in kidney recipients, the organ appears to be most vulnerable to the toxic effects of cyclosporine. Among other contributing factors to the development of interstitial fibrosis in these patients are prolonged perfusion time, warm ischemia time, as well as episodes of acute toxicity, and acute and chronic rejection. The reversibility of interstitial fibrosis and its correlation to renal function have not yet been determined. Reversibility of arteriolopathy has been reported after stopping cyclosporine or lowering the dosage.

### Extended infusion of rituximab combined with steroids is effective in inducing remission and reducing relapse in adult minimal change disease [^a8d1bd4a]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RTX has been proven to be effective in inducing remission of MCD. However, most of the researches were restricted in children. There are only a few small-sampled observational studies regarding RTX use in adult patients. The reported incidence of CR of MCD after RTX therapy in adult patients ranged from 50% to 100%. However, it is difficult to draw any reliable conclusion from previous studies. Firstly, different therapeutic protocols of RTX were used not only between different researches, but also in the same study. Moreover, in certain researches, patients were already in remission due to previous treatment. Adult patients with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulonephritis (FSGS) were enrolled in certain studies. Last but not least is that different immunosuppressive drugs excluding steroids were used in the RTX protocols. B-cell driven therapy had been used in some researches, which showed promising effects. However, interaction between RTX and podocyte function was also considered important of RTX therapy in MCD. Some studies implied that relapse did not always happen during B cell reconstruction as well. In our study, CD19+ B-lymphocyte cell count at the time of relapse in 3 patients varied from 2–459/μL, which also indicated that effectiveness of RTX in MCD might not be only attributed to B cell depletion. While, we firstly apply 375mg/m² RTX treatment once three weeks for 3 dose combined with corticosteroids in all the patients. Only 4 patients required additional infusion, and 1 patient declined the third dose of RTX resulting from uncontrolled concurrent infection. The incidence of CR in our study is 91.67%, which concluded that RTX combined with steroids is effective in inducing remission in adult MCD patients with considerable remission rate.

The optimal dose of RTX, which combines the maximum remission duration with minimal side effects, is difficult to define, even in lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis. In lymphoma, R-CHOP-21 schedule provided a longer exposure and maximized the exposure to clinical relevant concentrations of RTX, compared to R-CHOP-14. While R-CHOP-14 protocol ensured higher C-max and C-min during infusion period. Moreover, in patients manifesting nephrotic syndrome, serum RTX concentration is significantly lower than that in RA or Myasthenia gravis. Probably due to the loss of RTX in urine in patients with remarkable proteinuria. However, loss of RTX in urine was not documented in MCD. Therefore, further investigation with respect to serum concentration of RTX in MCD and superior protocol with optimal initial dose and maintenance dose are required.

### The natural history of chronic allograft nephropathy [^a06e7bbe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

With improved immunosuppression and early allograft survival, chronic allograft nephropathy has become the dominant cause of kidney-transplant failure.

Methods

We evaluated the natural history of chronic allograft nephropathy in a prospective study of 120 recipients with type 1 diabetes, all but 1 of whom had received kidney-pancreas transplants. We obtained 961 kidney-transplant-biopsy specimens taken regularly from the time of transplantation to 10 years thereafter.

Results

Two distinctive phases of injury were evident as chronic allograft nephropathy evolved. An initial phase of early tubulointerstitial damage from ischemic injury (P < 0.05), prior severe rejection (P < 0.01), and subclinical rejection (P < 0.01) predicted mild disease by one year, which was present in 94.2 percent of patients. Early subclinical rejection was common (affecting 45.7 percent of biopsy specimens at three months), and the risk was increased by the occurrence of a prior episode of severe rejection and reduced by tacrolimus and mycophenolate therapy (both P < 0.05) and gradually abated after one year. Both subclinical rejection and chronic rejection were associated with increased tubulointerstitial damage (P < 0.01). Beyond one year, a later phase of chronic allograft nephropathy was characterized by microvascular and glomerular injury. Chronic rejection (defined as persistent subclinical rejection for two years or longer) was uncommon (5.8 percent). Progressive high-grade arteriolar hyalinosis with luminal narrowing, increasing glomerulosclerosis, and additional tubulointerstitial damage was accompanied by the use of calcineurin inhibitors. Nephrotoxicity, implicated in late ongoing injury, was almost universal at 10 years, even in grafts with excellent early histologic findings. By 10 years, severe chronic allograft nephropathy was present in 58.4 percent of patients, with sclerosis in 37.3 percent of glomeruli. Tubulointerstitial and glomerular damage, once established, was irreversible, resulting in declining renal function and graft failure.

Conclusions

Chronic allograft nephropathy represents cumulative and incremental damage to nephrons from time-dependent immunologic and nonimmunologic causes.

### Definition, diagnosis and clinical management of non-obstructive kidney dysplasia: a consensus statement by the ERKNet working group on kidney malformations [^104848ed]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Pathology of kidney dysplasia

Kidney dysplasia may be unilateral or bilateral. There may be segmental or diffuse involvement. Kidney dysplasia is often associated with additional features of CAKUT. Dysplastic kidneys are often cystic but unlike in typical presentations of polycystic kidney diseases, these kidneys are not massively enlarged but are about the size of normal for age kidneys or smaller.

Kidney dysplasia is a severe phenotype within the CAKUT spectrum and is often associated with other CAKUT such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Dysplastic kidneys are found with and without ureteral obstruction. In either case, hallmark findings are distinct from classic polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD, ADPKD).

Histopathologically, there is a disorganized architecture of renal cortex and medulla with disrupted nephron differentiation (observed at low–medium-power magnification). At higher magnification, the most characteristic feature is primitive ducts (tubules) surrounded by collarettes of the mesenchymal tissue. Loose mesenchymal tissue and cartilage are common features. Cysts may be lined with cuboidal or columnar epithelium, or no epithelium at all. Glomerular pathology such as glomerulocystic changes is also described.

Hallmark findings in dysplastic kidneys generally are a reduction of mature nephron mass and presence of non-functional and non-renal tissue, often in the form of mesenchymal cells and cartilage. Other types of non-renal tissue may also be present. Collarettes are characterized by densely packed cells. Cysts may be present but are not an obligatory finding.

### G-CSF mediates increased renal neutrophils and kidney damage in a psoriasis mouse model [^f75a7716]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

G-CSF Neutralization in KC-Tie2 Mice Decreases Renal Neutrophil Infiltration and Improves Renal Damage

To examine a causative role for G-CSF in mediating the kidney damage observed in KC-Tie2 mice, we used neutralizing antibodies to block G-CSF function. Neutralization of G-CSF reduced circulating neutrophils compared with isotype control-treated KC-Tie2 mice (Figure 6 A), but did not significantly change the number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, or the hematocrit. Epidermal thickening, a key histological feature of psoriasis, was increased in KC-Tie2 compared with controls treated with isotype control antibodies, as expected. However, despite decreased neutrophils in psoriasiform skin of KC-Tie2 mice with G-CSF neutralization, epidermal thickness was unchanged. This suggests that G-CSF, and by inference neutrophils, do not contribute significantly to psoriasiform skin lesions in this model. Using flow cytometry, we then assessed the impact of G-CSF neutralization on tissues outside the skin, such as the kidney. We observed a selective decrease in neutrophils in the kidneys of KC-Tie2 mice with G-CSF neutralization, without a change in renal T cell or macrophage numbers (Figure 6 B;). Given that Lcn2 is increased in KC-Tie2 kidneys and promotes neutrophil chemotaxis, we examined changes in renal Lcn2 (lipocalin 2) following G-CSF neutralization. Lcn2 in KC-Tie2 mouse kidneys was decreased following G-CSF neutralization, demonstrating that G-CSF regulates Lcn2 levels in the kidney, likely through production by the increased renal neutrophils. Finally, to determine the effects of G-CSF neutralization on kidney damage, histological analysis was performed, which revealed significant improvements in glomerulosclerosis in KC-Tie2 mice (Figure 6 C and 6 D) along with decreases in albuminuria (Figure 6 E). Taken together, these findings identify a critical role for G-CSF in mediating psoriasis-induced renal damage.

### Urinary tract infection in children… [^7901463b]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

13–16 Urine culture also is recommended for children with recurrent symptoms. Urine dipstick analysis can rule out UTI if the result is negative, but a positive result on dip-stick testing is insufficient to diagnose UTI because false-positive results are common. In a cohort study. ADDITIONAL TESTING Previously, imaging studies were recommended for any child with a UTI. The 1999 clinical practice guideline. Routine imaging increased the use of prophylactic antibiotics but did not reduce the rate of recurrent UTIs or renal scarring at two years. These results suggest that imaging is not useful in determining which children might benefit from prophylactic antibiotics. 27 of 309 children one to 24 months of age with a first febrile UTI. Results of ultrasonography were normal in 88 percent, and abnormalities did not change management.

Initial renal scans suggested acute pyelonephritis in 61 percent of patients, but febrile UTI in infants is managed with the presumption of pyelonephritis. VCUG and repeat renal scans showed vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring in 39 and 9. 5 percent of infants, respectively. However, the manner in which VUR or renal scarring should alter the course of management is controversial. In some reviews, 28, 29 authors have suggested that VUR predisposes children to recurrent pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Severe VUR has been associated with recurrent UTI 30 and recurrent pyelonephritis, 31 but the association of VUR with renal scarring has been inconsistent. 32, 33 Renal scarring is associated with recurrent UTI 32 and recurrent pyelonephritis, 34 but a causal relationship has not been established.
25. Treatment Empiric antibiotic therapy is reasonable while awaiting culture results if there is a high clinical suspicion of UTI.

23 Subsequently changing antibiotics based on reported sensitivities may be unnecessary if clinical resolution occurs. According to the AAP, the child should be reevaluated with a repeat urine culture and renal/bladder ultrasonography if clinical improvement does not occur within two days. 23.

### Dense mapping of MYH9 localizes the strongest kidney disease associations to the region of introns 13 to 15 [^c02182ff]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study participants

We studied three case groups, all self-identified as of African descent and for simplicity described as AA (Table 1). Cases included individuals with biopsy-proven idiopathic FSGS, biopsy-proven HIVAN with collapsing glomerulopathy; and H-ESKD, generally without kidney biopsy. These groups have been previously described. Idiopathic FSGS and HIVAN cases were enrolled from 22 academic medical centers in the USA as part of the NIH FSGS Genetic Study. Idiopathic FSGS cases were diagnosed according to standard pathologic criteria; cases consistent with post-adaptive FSGS (e.g. associated with obesity, reflux nephropathy and sickle cell nephropathy) and with FSGS due to hypertension, medications or other genetic causes were excluded. HIVAN cases had kidney biopsies that were consistent with collapsing glomerulopathy (also termed the collapsing variant of FSGS) with capillary collapse and podocyte hyperplasia. H-ESKD cases were recruited at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine from North Carolina and neighboring states; cases were defined by hypertension prior to kidney failure with hypertensive target organ damage and low-level proteinuria, when these data were available (≤ 30 mg/100 mL on urine dipstick, < 0.5 g/day protein, or urine protein/creatinine ratio < 0.5 g/g). H-ESKD cases did not have diabetes, HIV infection or other known specific etiologies of kidney disease.
