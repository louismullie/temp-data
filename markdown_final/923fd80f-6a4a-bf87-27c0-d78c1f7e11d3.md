## Question

Elevate urine ph means

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "elevate urine pH" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal definition and normal urine pH ranges. Then, I should verify the physiologic mechanisms that raise urine pH. Next, I will examine the clinical contexts where elevating urine pH is therapeutic versus when it is pathologic. After that, I need to check how to measure urine pH accurately and what pitfalls to avoid. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer with practical implications and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the literal meaning: "elevate urine pH" simply means to increase the hydrogen ion concentration in urine, making it more alkaline. Normal urine pH typically ranges from about 4.5 to 8.0, so "elevating" implies shifting toward the higher end of that spectrum, often to around 6.5–7.5 depending on the clinical goal [^0c9f883f] [^3df275a6].

> I need to check the physiologic mechanisms that raise urine pH. The kidney regulates acid–base balance by reabsorbing bicarbonate and excreting acid as titratable acids and ammonium; when alkali is administered or endogenous base production rises, net acid excretion falls and urine pH increases, reflecting a more alkaline urine [^3f533989] [^e4a510cf]. Hold on, I should verify the role of citrate: oral citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate, increasing urinary pH and citrate, which also complexes calcium and can inhibit calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystallization, though the pH effect can theoretically increase calcium phosphate supersaturation, so dosing must be individualized [^a5cd7e01] [^d6eadef6].

> Next, I should review when elevating urine pH is therapeutic. For uric acid stones, raising urine pH to about 6.0–6.5 increases uric acid solubility and reduces recurrence; potassium citrate is first-line for this purpose and is guideline-supported [^3df275a6] [^24c4ad67]. For cystine stones, a higher target of about 7.0–7.5 is recommended to improve cystine solubility, again with potassium citrate as the mainstay and dose titration to urine pH [^3df275a6] [^d4560a38]. Wait, let me verify gout data: in patients with gout and low urine pH, adding urine alkalization to urate-lowering therapy has been associated with reduced albuminuria and fewer flares, suggesting renal and clinical benefits beyond stone prevention, though larger trials are needed [^4e85baf8] [^3248ab44].

> But wait, what if urine pH is already high or the stone risk is calcium phosphate–predominant? I should confirm that persistently alkaline urine (pH > 6.5) promotes calcium phosphate stone formation, so indiscriminate alkalinization can worsen that risk; in such cases, management should prioritize volume, sodium restriction, thiazides to reduce calciuria, and cautious citrate use with monitoring of pH and supersaturation indices [^e5cd7d4e] [^1cfa2938]. Hold on, I should verify the balance: citrate both complexes calcium and raises pH; the net effect on calcium phosphate supersaturation depends on the relative magnitude of these opposing forces, which is why individualized risk assessment and follow-up urine testing are essential [^d6eadef6].

> I will now examine when elevated urine pH reflects pathology rather than therapy. Distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1) presents with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and inappropriately high urine pH (> 5.3) due to impaired distal hydrogen secretion; this is a classic cause of calcium phosphate stones and nephrocalcinosis and requires specific evaluation and alkali therapy to correct acidosis, not simply to "alkalinize" urine [^93435fa2] [^e3fb5b89]. Let me consider other causes: chronic metabolic alkalosis, urinary tract infection with urea-splitting organisms, and certain medications (e.g., acetazolamide) can also raise urine pH and should be identified and treated accordingly [^22ce5b50] [^3faed993].

> Next, I should review how to measure urine pH accurately. Spot urine pH is convenient but variable; first-morning samples can be misleading due to overnight acidification, so mid-morning or afternoon samples collected at least 4 hours after eating are preferred when assessing baseline risk or treatment response [^c6c9b210]. I need to ensure collection technique is correct: for 24-hour studies, pH should be measured promptly or the container should be sealed to minimize CO2 loss, which can artifactually raise pH; however, in acidic urine, brief air exposure has minimal effect, whereas in more alkaline urine, CO2 loss can meaningfully increase pH, so caution is warranted [^eb248bfb]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse urinalysis with pH in stone formers: yes, both AUA and EAU recommend including urine pH in the initial and follow-up evaluation of nephrolithiasis [^85b642df] [^2216e840].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. Elevating urine pH is a targeted strategy to reduce uric acid and cystine stone recurrence by improving solute solubility, but it must be balanced against the risk of promoting calcium phosphate stones in susceptible patients. Therefore, therapy should be individualized, monitored with 24-hour urine chemistries including pH, citrate, calcium, and supersaturation indices, and adjusted over time [^3df275a6] [^dd3cd644]. I should double-check that contemporary cohort data suggest urine pH has a complex, nonlinear relationship with stone risk and that calcium, volume, and citrate often carry stronger independent associations; this reinforces the need to interpret pH in the context of the full metabolic profile rather than in isolation [^f348e2f1].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and drug–pH interactions are considered. Alkali therapy can raise serum potassium, so potassium citrate should be used cautiously in patients with hyperkalemia or reduced GFR, and alternatives like sodium bicarbonate may be preferred in select cases with close monitoring. Conversely, agents like memantine and amphetamines have pH-dependent renal clearance, and alkaline urine can markedly reduce their elimination, increasing toxicity risk, so medication reconciliation is essential when intentionally modifying urine pH [^0985df08] [^413f77f5]. Hold on, I should verify that SGLT2 inhibitors can modulate urine pH differently in calcium versus uric acid stone formers; indeed, empagliflozin raised pH in uric acid stone formers and lowered it in calcium stone formers, illustrating how systemic therapy can have divergent pH effects that may be leveraged clinically in selected patients [^a116594f].

---

Elevating urine pH means **increasing alkalinity** of urine, typically to **6.0–7.5**, to reduce the risk of uric acid and cystine stones by increasing their solubility [^3df275a6] [^d4560a38]. This is achieved with **potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate** [^a5cd7e01] [^515c6357], with dosing adjusted to urine pH to balance efficacy and the risk of calcium phosphate stones [^0c9f883f]. Urine pH should be monitored regularly, as overly alkaline urine (> 7.5) can promote calcium phosphate stones [^e5cd7d4e]; in patients with calcium phosphate stones, acidification may be preferred [^cf444941].

---

## Physiological basis of urine pH

Urine pH reflects the **kidney's acid–base regulation**, with normal urine pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. The kidneys excrete hydrogen ions and reabsorb bicarbonate to maintain systemic acid–base balance; thus, urine pH varies with diet, hydration, and acid–base status [^3f533989].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated urine pH

Elevating urine pH has distinct clinical implications, chiefly for **stone disease**:

- **Uric acid stones**: Low urine pH (< 5.5) promotes uric acid crystallization; raising pH to 6.0–6.5 increases uric acid solubility and reduces recurrence [^3df275a6] [^24c4ad67].

- **Cystine stones**: Cystine solubility rises with pH; targets of 7.0–7.5 are recommended [^3df275a6] [^d4560a38].

- **Calcium phosphate stones**: Alkaline urine (> 6.5) increases calcium phosphate supersaturation and risk; thus, pH elevation is generally avoided in these patients [^e5cd7d4e] [^1cfa2938].

---

## Methods to elevate urine pH

Several **pharmacologic and dietary** strategies are used:

| **Method** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Potassium citrate | Metabolizes to bicarbonate, raising pH and citrate | - First-line for uric acid and cystine stones <br/> - Monitor for hyperkalemia [^3df275a6] [^24c4ad67] |
| Sodium bicarbonate | Direct alkali load | - Useful if potassium is contraindicated <br/> - Monitor sodium load [^515c6357] [^3f533989] |
| Dietary alkali load | Fruits/vegetables increase pH | Less potent than pharmacologic therapy; adjunctive only [^cf444941] |

---

## Monitoring and risks

Regular **urine pH monitoring** is essential to avoid overly alkaline urine, which can precipitate calcium phosphate stones [^e5cd7d4e]. Risks include hyperkalemia with potassium citrate and sodium load with bicarbonate; individualize therapy and monitor electrolytes and renal function [^a5cd7e01] [^3f533989].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **urine alkalinization** for uric acid and cystine stones, with pH targets of 6.0–6.5 and 7.0–7.5, respectively [^3df275a6] [^d4560a38]. For calcium phosphate stones, avoid alkalinization and consider acidification strategies [^cf444941].

---

Elevating urine pH is a **targeted strategy** to increase the solubility of uric acid and cystine, thereby preventing stone recurrence, but it requires careful monitoring to avoid promoting calcium phosphate stones [^3df275a6] [^e5cd7d4e].

### Fasting urine pH is independent of insulin sensitivity [^a1321b0b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It has recently been suggested that a low urine pH be added to the abnormalities linked to insulin resistance. This conclusion is based on the finding of a low urine pH in individuals with clinical syndromes associated with insulin resistance and not on studies in which a direct measure of insulin sensitivity was shown to be significantly related to differences in urine pH.

Objective

To address this issue, we quantified insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) by using the insulin suppression test in 96 apparently healthy, nondiabetic individuals and defined its relation to fasting urine pH.

Design

Urine samples were collected and analyzed from a cohort of healthy subjects within a narrow body mass index range who were recruited to determine insulin sensitivity.

Results

There was an approximate 6-fold variation in values for IMGU in this population, with no relation to urine pH (r = 0.02). Furthermore, there was no relation between body mass index, as a surrogate estimate of insulin resistance, and urine pH (r = 0.06).

Conclusion

On the basis of these findings, we question the view that a low urine pH be added to the abnormalities linked to insulin resistance in low-risk populations.

### Urine: waste product or biologically active tissue? [^47b6aff4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Historically, urine has been viewed primarily as a waste product with little biological role in the overall health of an individual. Increasingly, data suggest that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion. For example, urine might act as an irritant and contribute to symptoms through interaction with-and potential compromise of-the urothelium.

Methods

To explore the concept that urine may be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity and to discuss existing evidence and novel research questions that may yield insight into such a role, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease invited experts in the fields of comparative evolutionary physiology, basic science, nephrology, urology, pediatrics, metabolomics, and proteomics (among others) to a Urinology Think Tank meeting on February 9, 2015.

Results

This report reflects ideas that evolved from this meeting and current literature, including the concept of urine quality, the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of urine, including the microbiota, cells, exosomes, pH, metabolites, proteins, and specific gravity (among others). Additionally, the manuscript presents speculative, and hopefully testable, ideas about the functional roles of urine constituents in health and disease.

Conclusion

Moving forward, there are several questions that need further understanding and pursuit. There were suggestions to consider actively using various animal models and their biological specimens to elaborate on basic mechanistic information regarding human bladder dysfunction.

### Metabolic acidosis [^afff4465]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Studies to identify the basis for an alkaline urine pH in patients with calcium hydrogen phosphate kidney stones [^22ce5b50]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, increased urine pH can be caused by chronic kidney disease, pyloric stenosis, metabolic alkalosis, hyperkalemia, Proteus, vegetarianism, respiratory alkalosis, urinary tract infections and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In addition, increased urine pH can be caused by medications such as sodium lactate, amiloride and acetazolamide.

### Urine pH in renal calcium stone formers who do and do not increase stone phosphate content with time [^e5cd7d4e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium phosphate (CaP) renal stones appear to be increasing in prevalence, and are caused by high urine CaP supersaturation, which arises from genetic hypercalciuria and high urine pH. Renal damage from stones or procedures, or treatments for stone could raise urine pH; alternatively pH may be intrinsically high in some people who are thereby predisposed to CaP stones.

Methods

To distinguish these alternatives we sequenced changes in urine pH and stone CaP content asking which occurs first in patients whose stones showed progressive increase in CaP over time. From 4767 patients we found 62 in whom we could document transformation from calcium oxalate (CaOx) to CaP stones, and 134 CaOx controls who did not transform. Laboratory and clinical finding were contrasted between these groups.

Results

Even when patients were forming relatively pure CaOx stones, those destined to increase stone CaP had higher urine pH than controls who never did so. Their higher pH was present before and during treatments to prevent new stone formation. Shock wave lithotripsy was strongly associated with increasing stone CaP but urine pH bore no relationship to number of procedures.

Conclusion

We conclude that high pH may not be acquired as a result of stones or their treatments but may precede transformation from CaOx to CaP stones and arise from diet or possibly heredity.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^ae00dbd8]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Urine pH is a major risk factor for the formation of several types of kidney stones. High urine pH promotes the formation of calcium phosphate containing stones, whereas low pH favors the formation of uric acid stones. In a combined kidney stone cohort from Iceland (N cases = 5876, N controls = 322 970) and the UK Biobank database (individuals of white British ancestry: N cases = 4726, N controls = 403 841) (Materials and Methods), the pH-increasing alleles of the SNPs at POU2AF1 and WDR72 associate with increased risk of kidney stones (OR META (95% CI) = 1.06 (1.03, 1.09) and 1.09 (1.06, 1.12), respectively, P META = 2.3 × 10–4 and 4.8 × 10–8; Supplementary Material, Table S12). The other urine pH signals at 3q21 and 3q27 did not associate with kidney stones (P META = 0.087 and 0.40, respectively; Supplementary Material, Table S12).

### Lower urinary pH is useful for predicting renovascular disorder onset in patients with diabetes [^8182604f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower urinary pH (UpH), which is common among complicated case patients such as obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributes to precipitation of uric acid (UA) in the urine. For UA to precipitate in the urine, either the urinary concentration of UA must rise past its saturation point or the UpH must drop. The serum UA concentration is elevated in patients with metabolic syndrome. Low UpH is closely linked to the accumulation of visceral fat, insulin resistance (IR), methylglyoxal concentration, and hypertension. It is also strongly related to increases in intrarenal oxidative stress (OS) and the acceleration of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

A decrease in UpH occurs because of an increased supply of hydrogen ions (H +) to the urine, or decreased elimination of urinary H +. The former occurs because of increased blood H + (acidosis) or increased H + secretion from the renal tubules to the urine, whereas the latter occurs because of a reduction in the supply of ammonium (NH 3) to the urine. Acidosis takes various forms, such as respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. In diabetics, decreased urinary NH 3 contributes to a drop in UpH.

Researchers have reported that a decrease in UpH is a predictive factor for CKD, that a lower UpH reinforces OS inside the renal tubules via albumin reabsorption, mediated by the reinforcement of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, and that when UpH is elevated via the administration of sodium bicarbonate, the incidence of initiation of dialysis in CKD is reduced. These reports strongly suggest that a lower UpH is closely linked to the advancement of renovascular damage. However, there are very few studies in patients with diabetes that examine the relationship between lower UpH and the advancement of renovascular damage. We therefore examined the influence of lowered UpH on the 10-year progression of renovascular disorders.

### The efficacy and safety of citrate mixture vs sodium bicarbonate on urine alkalization in Chinese primary gout patients with benzbromarone: a prospective, randomized controlled study [^515c6357]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes

The urine pH value of both groups increased significantly from the baseline to the final follow-up time point (P < 0.05, Fig. 2). The median urine pH was elevated 9.1% in the sodium bicarbonate group [from 5.50 (95% CI 5.43, 5.57) to 6.00 (95% CI 5.81, 6.05)] and 7.2% in the citrate mixture group [from 5.53 (95% CI 5.48, 5.63) to 5.93 (95% CI 5.80, 6.01)] (Fig. 2A). Comparisons regarding urine pH between treatment groups for each time point showed no significant difference (Fig. 2A). We subgrouped the patients according to their pH values (> 6.2, 5.5–6.2, < 5.5) and found no significant difference of urine pH between the two groups either at baseline (P > 0.05, Fig. 2B) or at week 12 (P > 0.05, Fig. 2C). 2

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^80ebf359]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^03c010e1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^8f5321c6]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — uric acid stones or calcium stones with high urinary uric acid: Clinicians should counsel patients with uric acid stones or calcium stones and relatively high urinary uric acid to limit intake of non-dairy animal protein (Expert Opinion). Patients with a history of uric acid stones should be counseled to increase the alkali load and decrease the acid load of their diet in an effort to increase urine pH and reduce urinary acidity.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^e968fa47]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to prevention of stone recurrence, AUA 2014 guidelines recommend to offer potassium citrate in patients with cystine stones, in order to raise urinary pH to an optimal level.

---

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^0c9f883f]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to oral chemolysis, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to instruct patients how to monitor urine pH by dipstick and to modify the dosage of alkalinizing medication according to urine pH, as changes in urine pH are a direct consequence of such medication.

### Effect of thiazolidinedione therapy on the risk of uric acid stones [^1de725cd]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The most important variable leading to uric acid stones is low urine pH. Major causal conditions associated with low urine pH are metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In the study by Maalouf et al., treatment of uric acid stone formers with pioglitazone led to small but significant increases in urine pH. Pioglitazone will not supplant alkali administration to prevent uric acid stones, but the study helps confirm that insulin resistance is an important cause of low urine pH that causes uric acid stones.

### Low urine pH: a novel feature of the metabolic syndrome [^3afb9666]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased urine pH can be caused by acute diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute starvation, respiratory acidosis and renal tubular acidosis. In addition, decreased urine pH can be caused by medications such as methenamine hippurate, diazoxide, vitamin C and corticotropin repository.

### Low urine pH: a novel feature of the metabolic syndrome [^38c9bcd4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The metabolic syndrome is associated with alterations in renal function. An overly acidic urine has been described as a renal manifestation of the metabolic syndrome in patients with kidney stone disease. This study examined the association between the metabolic syndrome and urine pH in individuals without a history of nephrolithiasis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A total of 148 adults who were free of kidney stones were evaluated in this outpatient cross-sectional study. Height, weight, BP, fasting blood, and 24-h urine chemistries were obtained. Urine pH was measured by pH electrode. The following features of the metabolic syndrome were evaluated: BP; body mass index; and serum triglyceride, glucose, and HDL cholesterol concentrations. The degree of insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance.

Results

Participants with the metabolic syndrome had a significantly lower 24-h urine pH compared with participants without the metabolic syndrome. Mean 24-h urine pH, adjusted for age, gender, creatinine clearance, and 24-h urine sulfate, decreased from 6.15, 6.10, 5.99, 5.85, to 5.69 with increasing number of metabolic syndrome abnormalities. An association was observed between 24-h urine pH and each metabolic feature. After adjustment for age, gender, creatinine clearance, urine sulfate, and body mass index, a significant inverse relationship was noted between 24-h urine pH and the degree of insulin resistance.

Conclusions

An unduly acidic urine is a feature of the metabolic syndrome and is associated with the degree of insulin resistance.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^916d9c32]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition that many people in the Western world have but do not realise it. It occurs when there is retention of acid in the body, which leads to a depletion in the bicarbonate stores of the body. The term metabolic acidosis is typically used when referring to low blood pH or acidemia due to a metabolic abnormality. However, this is inappropriate as most cases of metabolic acidosis do not have acidemia. In fact, a low blood pH is typically one of the last surrogate markers to become abnormal in those with low-grade metabolic acidosis. This is because the body maintains a normal blood pH at the expense of bicarbonate reserves. Metabolic acidosis primarily occurs inside the cell and in the fluid that surrounds our tissues (interstitial fluid). When checking for metabolic acidosis the clinician should look at fasting serum bicarbonate, urinary pH (with a measurement at least 4 hours separated from the last ingested meal) and 24-hour urinary citrate levels. While there is not a universally accepted way to diagnose low-grade metabolic acidosis, this paper will help to give the clinician insights into checking for this condition in their patients.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^3df275a6]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — uric acid and cystine stones alkalinization states that clinicians should offer potassium citrate to patients with uric acid and cystine stones to raise urinary pH to an optimal level (Expert Opinion). The solubility of uric acid and cystine is increased at higher urinary pH values, potassium citrate therapy provides an alkali load that leads to increased urine pH, and for uric acid stone formers, urine pH should be increased to 6.0, and for cystine stone formers, a urine pH of 7.0 should be achieved.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^39d12837]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

It is the slow depletion in our body's buffering systems that keeps our blood pH normal despite acid overload. Thus, some individuals can have a normal blood pH level and a fully functioning buffering system in the body, whereas others can have a normal blood pH but their buffering systems are deficient. An accumulated of acid in the cell and/or the interstitial fluid can lead to cellular damage, pain and insulin resistance.

One buffering system in the body is bicarbonate. This system is the primary buffering system in the blood, and it helps to maintain a normal blood pH. Typically, serum bicarbonate levels drop prior to blood pH. Thus, measuring fasting serum bicarbonate levels is important when checking for low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, it should still be paired with several other tests. A normal serum bicarbonate level is considered 23–30 mEq/L. However, optimal serum bicarbonate levels are more around 25–30 mEq/L (preferably 27–30 mEq/L). A serum bicarbonate level at or below 24 mEq/L should be considered suboptimal and suggests low-grade metabolic acidosis, especially if paired with low urinary citrate or high urinary ammonium. A urinary pH of < 5.3 in adults or < 5.6 in children almost certainly indicates metabolic acidosis and is found in a large portion of the population. However, a urinary pH < 6.5 indicates a net acid excretion of > 40 mEq, which can lead to acid retention and metabolic acidosis in approximately 50% of the population. Thus, even a urinary pH of 6.5 or less can suggest low-grade metabolic acidosis. For most individuals, an optimal urinary pH is ~6.8–7.0, which signifies a net acid excretion of approximately zero. Box 1 summarises the ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^85b642df]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to urine tests, AUA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain urinalysis, including both dipstick and microscopic evaluation, in order to assess urine pH and indicators of infection and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type in patients with newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones.

### Regulating urine pH levels to alleviate chronic joint pain… [^85815dae]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Pain perception is extremely complex and a perceived connection has been noted between the level of pain felt by individuals and bodily fluid hydrogen ion concentration, i.e. pH; oral water-soluble alkaline components containing K, Ca, Mg and Cl salts have been used for reducing bodily fluid and tissue acid concentrations. Urine pH is now considered to reflect the bodily acid-base balance and is directly related to the dietary acid-base load. Currently, potassium citrate has been widely used in urology for treatment of patients with uric acid and cystine stones. Aside from the use of Kcit in the treatment of kidney stones, there have been isolated reports about the anti-inflammatory and hypoalgesic systems effects of Kcit. Alkalinization by diet alone has also been effective for removing uric acid from the body, though its effects on urine pH levels are weaker.

It is considered that alkalinization of urine reflects body fluid alkalinization. This has the perceived effects of increased bone density, improved muscle function, and a speculative decrease in insulin resistance. Research Project Question/Theme The investigators aim to determine causal relationship between regulating urine pH levels between 7. 0 and
7. 5 and decreasing chronic joint pain. The investigators hypothesize that maintenance of an alkaline urinary pH will result in a decrease in personally reported levels of chronic joint pain using a citrate treatment regimen. After the baseline measurements have been established, instructions on the urine alkalinization treatment regimen will be distributed to the subject and treatment solution will be obtained. This treatment will vary from person to person and is easily modified. Subjects will measure, report, and take the treatment for 6 months.

While on the treatment, all subjects will be asked to report and/or measure the following values on a daily basis:

- Report when and how much treatment was taken that day
- Measure urine pH levels daily at 10 A. M. using a pH strip
- Rate their pain 3X daily using a modified pain rating scale
- Report daily food and beverage intake
- Visit the physician investigator for monthly a follow-up visit to review the pain ratings and pH values noted during the past month.

### Does the exposure of urine samples to air affect diagnostic tests for urine acidification? [^eb248bfb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

For accurate measurement of pH, urine collection under oil to limit the escape of CO(2) on air exposure is recommended. This study aims to test the hypothesis that urine collection under oil is not necessary in acidic urine in which bicarbonate and CO(2) are minor buffers, because loss of CO(2) would have little effect on its pH.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

One hundred consecutive random urine samples were collected under oil and analyzed for pH, pCO(2), and HCO(3)(-) immediately and after 5 minutes of vigorous shaking in uncovered flasks to allow CO(2) escape.

Results

The pH values in 97 unshaken samples ranged from 5.03 to 6.83. With shaking, urine pCO(2) decreased by 76%, whereas urine HCO(3)(-) decreased by 60%. Meanwhile, urine baseline median pH (interquartile range) of 5.84 (5.44–6.25) increased to 5.93 (5.50–6.54) after shaking (ΔpH = 0.12 [0.07–0.29], P < 0.001). ΔpH with pH ≤ 6.0 was significantly lower than the ΔpH with pH > 6.0 (0.08 [0.05–0.12] versus 0.36 [0.23–0.51], P < 0.001). Overall, the lower the baseline pH, the smaller the ΔpH.

Conclusions

The calculation of buffer reactions in a hypothetical acidic urine predicted a negligible effect on urine pH on loss of CO(2) by air exposure, which was empirically proven by the experimental study. Therefore, exposure of urine to air does not substantially alter the results of diagnostic tests for urine acidification, and urine collection under oil is not necessary.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^99452386]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining metabolic acidosis

Acidemia, or too much acid in the blood, only occurs when the body's buffering capacity can no longer maintain a normal pH level. A normal blood pH is considered to be 7.35–7.45. However, even at a normal blood pH metabolic acidosis can occur. In fact, once the blood pH falls below 7.4, there is usually acid retention in the body and low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, the blood pH does not drop below the normal range until metabolic acidosis has become severe. Once this occurs it is usually referred to as 'metabolic acidosis' by the clinician. However, this is actually acidemia (or too much acid in the blood). Thus, someone with a low blood pH has likely had low-grade metabolic acidosis for years or more likely decades.

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is something that many people in the Western world have. Low-grade means there are no apparent or noticeable harms but the body is retaining acid, depleting bicarbonate stores and damage is occurring in numerous tissues in the body. Typically, with low-grade metabolic acidosis, the blood pH drops slightly, as does the bicarbonate levels, but they will still be in the 'normal' range. Thus, if blood pH and/or bicarbonate levels are at the lower end of normal this is highly suggestive that someone has metabolic acidosis.

With low-grade metabolic acidosis, the total blood buffering capacity is reduced and thus a greater reliance on muscle, bone and connective tissue will be required for the elimination of additional acid. The harms of low-grade metabolic acidosis increase with age and decreasing kidney function as the kidneys ability to excrete acid goes down. The increase in the acid load in the body worsens kidney function over the long run. For example, chronic metabolic acidosis leads to nephron hypertrophy in the kidneys of animals. This is likely due to the toxic effects that ammonia has on the kidneys. Metabolic acidosis can also lead to an increased loss of sodium and potassium in the urine, as well as an increased loss of water increasing the risk of dehydration. In addition, metabolic acidosis can cause magnesium and calcium loss out the urine.

### The primary hyperoxalurias: an algorithm for diagnosis [^f4ad3163]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are inborn errors of metabolism resulting in increased urinary excretion of oxalate. Nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure result. Renal failure can occur as early as infancy or as late as the sixth decade of life, and if not addressed promptly, results in severe morbidity and mortality related to systemic oxalate deposition (oxalosis). Clinicians are likely to encounter few PH patients during a practicing lifetime. Definitive diagnosis requires special studies performed in only a small number of laboratories worldwide. Accordingly, delays in diagnosis are common.

Methods

An evidence-based guideline for diagnosis was developed.

Results

Patients with stones or nephrocalcinosis in childhood, recurrent calcium oxalate stones in adulthood, or renal insufficiency associated with stones or nephrocalcinosis should be evaluated for PH. A systematic approach to measurement of urine oxalate, glycolate and glycerate, and plasma oxalate is provided. Age-related variation in urine oxalate requires attention to normal ranges. Molecular analysis for mutations of the AGXT gene (PH, type I) or GRHPR gene (PH, type II) is definitive in some patients, while liver enzyme analysis is required for confirmation of the diagnosis in the remainder.

Conclusion

An evidence-based algorithm will facilitate recognition and diagnosis of patients with the PHs, permitting earlier treatment.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^c6c9b210]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis

Suboptimal fasting serum bicarbonate: < 27 mEq/L.
Optimal bicarbonate level: 27–32 mEq/L.
Optimal level prior to exercise: 31–38 mEq/L.
Suboptimal blood pH: < 7.42.
Optimal blood pH 7.42–7.45.
Optimal blood pH prior to exercise: 7.45–7.50.

High urinary ammonium (NH4+): Normal range is 15–45 ug/dL. Optimal < 40 mmol/day. Urinary ammonium starts to fall when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops below 40 mL/min. Thus, 24-hour urinary ammonium levels are not an appropriate way to look for low-grade metabolic acidosis once the GFR is < 40 mL/min.
High 24-hour urinary calcium (compared with calcium intake) ~16.67% of dietary calcium gets excreted in the urine, so for a dietary calcium intake of 900 mg, 150 mg will typically come out in the urine. If more than 16.67% of dietary calcium is coming out in the urine this suggests calcium loss, which may be due to metabolic acidosis.
Low 24-hour urinary citrate < 320 mg/24 hours. Optimal urinary citrate level: 600–800 mg/24 hours.
Low urinary pH A urinary pH of < 6.0 is formed from a diet that produces a net acid excretion of 70 mEq/day or higher, which for most people will lead to acid retention. Optimal urinary pH (net acid excretion of zero): ~6.8–7.5. Urine pH should not be taken first thing in the morning or less than 4 hours from eating. Spot urinary pH should be taken 4 hours or longer after eating but not first thing in the morning. The best time to take a urinary spot pH would be before dinner (at least 4 hours after eating lunch).
Low partial pressure of carbon dioxide < 35 mm Hg. Suboptimal < 38 mm Hg.

### Metabolic alkalosis from unsuspected ingestion: use of urine pH and anion gap [^7163ea70]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Underlying causes of metabolic alkalosis may be evident from history, evaluation of effective circulatory volume, and measurement of urine chloride concentration. However, identification of causes may be difficult for certain conditions associated with clandestine behaviors, such as surreptitious vomiting, use of drugs or herbal supplements with mineralocorticoid activity, abuse of laxatives or diuretics, and long-term use of alkalis. In these circumstances, clinicians often are bewildered by unexplained metabolic alkalosis from an incomplete history or persistent deception by the patient, leading to misdiagnosis and poor outcome. We present a case of severe metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia with a borderline urine chloride concentration in an alcoholic patient treated with a thiazide. The cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis eventually was linked to surreptitious ingestion of baking soda. This case highlights the necessity of a high index of suspicion for the diverse clandestine behaviors that can cause metabolic alkalosis and the usefulness of urine pH and anion gap in its differential diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^208963bd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated urolithiasis/nephrolithiasis with atazanavir (ATV) has onset weeks to months after starting therapy and may present with crystalluria, hematuria, pyuria, flank pain, and increased creatinine in some cases. ATV-related nephrolithiasis occurs in < 10% of patients and has been reported after stopping ATV. In adults, elevated urine pH (> 5.7) is noted; the risk factors in children are unknown. Maintain adequate hydration. Obtain urinalysis at least every 6–12 months. Provide adequate hydration and pain control. Consider using another ARV drug in place of ATV. DRV causes crystalluria, but it is not associated with nephrolithiasis.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^6f32707e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

### Influence of urine pH and citrate concentration on the upper limit of metastability for calcium phosphate [^db62f0ac]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the effects on the urine upper limit of metastability for calcium phosphate of citrate concentration and pH, and achievement of the upper limit of metastability by adding calcium or phosphate.

Materials and Methods

The citrate concentration in aliquots of 24-hour urine samples from normal males without a history of kidney stones was increased. The upper limit of metastability was determined by the point of visible crystal formation, as confirmed by increased optical density at 620 nm. when calcium or pH was increased. In additional experiments the upper limit of metastability was determined by adding calcium or phosphate at pH 5.9 and 6.4.

Results

Regardless of how the upper limit of metastability was achieved increasing the citrate concentration increased the former value by about 0.4 units per mM. citrate per l. The upper limit of metastability achieved in a given urine sample by adding phosphate or calcium did not differ. Increasing urine pH increased the upper limit of metastability.

Conclusions

Treatment with alkaline citrate salts may decrease stone formation via an increase in calcium phosphate upper limit of metastability by increasing urine citrate and by directly affecting increased pH.

### Type 4 renal tubular acidosis and uric acid nephrolithiasis: two faces of the same coin? [^778db4c2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes findings of recent studies examining the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and uric acid nephrolithiasis, two conditions characterized by an abnormally acidic urine.

Recent Findings

Both type 4 RTA and uric acid nephrolithiasis disproportionately occur in patients with type 2 diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease. Biochemically, both conditions are associated with reduced renal ammonium excretion resulting in impaired urinary buffering and low urine pH. Reduced ammoniagenesis is postulated to result from hyperkalemia in type 4 RTA and from insulin resistance and fat accumulation in the renal proximal tubule in uric acid nephrolithiasis. The typical biochemical findings of hyperkalemia and systemic acidosis of type 4 RTA are rarely reported in uric acid stone formers. Additional clinical differences between the two conditions include findings of higher urinary uric acid excretion and consequent urinary uric acid supersaturation in uric acid stone formers but not in type 4 RTA.

Summary

Type 4 RTA and uric acid nephrolithiasis share several epidemiological, clinical, and biochemical features. Although both conditions may be manifestations of diabetes mellitus and thus have a large at-risk population, the means to the shared biochemical finding of overly acidic urine are different. This difference in pathophysiology may explain the dissimilarity in the prevalence of kidney stone formation.

### Fructose increases risk for kidney stones: potential role in metabolic syndrome and heat stress [^f2919ab6]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The finding that fructose can directly increase the risk for kidney stones by altering pH and urinary oxalate and magnesium may help account for why soft drink consumption predisposes to kidney stones. In addition, dietary fructose is also known to increase serum and urine osmolarity and vasopressin release. Indeed, there is some evidence that fructose tends to shift water intracellularly (where it likely associates with glycogen) while maintaining a high serum osmolarity. Thus, it provides a mechanism for maintaining a low urine output, which may increase the risk for both kidney stones and acute kidney injury from urate crystalluria. This likely accounts for why the urine output only increased by approximately 400 cc despite the large fluid intake associated with fructose. It is interesting that low urine volumes, low urine pH, high serum uric acid, soft drinks, and elevated serum osmolarity all predict the development of CKD in addition to kidney stones, and that the epidemic of kidney stones and CKD appear linked. It is possible that the protective effects of bicarbonate in CKD are not due to neutralization of metabolic acidosis as much as it is the neutralization of the pH of the urine. We recommend further studies investigating how alterations in urinary constituents from fructose may influence both kidney stones and CKD.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^62f5f180]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^effa8e9b]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Why do humans accumulate acid in the body?

In the body, acid is defined as hydrogen ions (H +) and pH, stands for 'power of hydrogen', which is a measurement of hydrogen ions in the blood on a logarithmic scale. Base is defined as a hydrogen ion acceptor, which, includes bicarbonate (HCO3 −) and citrate in the body. Most diets lead to a positive excretion of acid out in the urine each day. Around 35 mEq of bicarbonate, or potential bicarbonate, is lost in the stool each day, even in people eating diets with excess acid ingestion. During periods of metabolic acidosis, there is a fall in alkali loss out the stool, but not a complete shut off. The kidney is also important for reabsorbing large amounts of bicarbonate, which decreases with age and kidney damage. Thus, humans can be thought of as acid producing, alkali losing organisms, which is partly why so many people in the Western world are thought to have low-grade metabolic acidosis.

In healthy people with normal kidney function, once the amount of acid that gets excreted out in the urine is > 0.4–1 mEq/kg of body weight per day (eg, 40–70 mEq/day for a 70 kg adult), there is acid retention in the body. Thus, the kidneys can only excrete a set amount of acid each day before there is retention. A typical Western diet leads to a net endogenous acid production of around 50–100 mEq of acid per day. Thus, most people are already near their threshold for retaining acid. As kidney function declines, which typically occurs at a rate of 1% starting at the age of 20 years old, the kidneys' ability to excrete acid and prevent acid retention in the body goes down. Indeed, the acid excretion capacity of the kidneys in those 55–75 years old is about 8 mEq less per day vs young people. This is why people who are 55 or older are particularly susceptible to acid retention. Additionally, as we age, we tend to select foods that are more acid-producing versus base-forming, which further contributes to acid retention in the body.

### Impact of adding urine alkalization therapy to xanthine oxidase inhibitor in gout management: a prospective cohort study [^4e85baf8]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we investigated the efficacy of a urine alkalization regimen in people with gout and low urine pH. Our findings indicate that urine alkalization regimen is associated with reduced UACR as well as lower gout flare incidence and pain levels within the first 12 weeks of ULT initiation. Unexpectedly, the Alk regimen was associated with improved TG as well as HDL-C levels. Collective findings suggested that urine alkalization could enhance management in people with gout and low urine pH when combined with ULT.

Low urine pH has been reported to be a predictor of CKD independent of SU. A prior study suggested that alkalization therapy could limit the pathophysiologic process of CKD progression. UACR is a sensitive and reliable index for glomeruli injury and a key criterion in CKD classification as recommended by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines. Here in this study, both eGFR and UACR were used to assess the efficacy of urine alkalization in people with gout. Though eGFR was not significantly different in the short 12-week time window in the Alk group, UACR was significantly improved with urine alkalization.

Some clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of urine alkalization therapy in CKD, whereas no prior study has investigated efficacy of the therapy on kidney function in people with gout and low urine pH. In people with CKD, acid load could increase ammoniagenesis in the proximal tubule and enhance mechanisms involved in the excretion of ammonium, which has been suggested to stimulate the alternative complement system, whereas this process could be prevented by alkali therapy. Additionally, increasing the local pH could modulate alternative complement pathway activation to exert anti-inflammatory roles for kidney protection. There is increasing evidence from experimental rodent models that uric acid crystalluria is important in driving CKD. Prior experimental work has shown that alkalization therapy strongly attenuates the elevation of inflammatory monocytes in crystal nephropathy in mice and shifts macrophage polarization towards anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in rats and humans, and that treatment with citrate after the SU washout leads to regression of inflammation, fibrosis and cystogenesis in a rat model of polycystic kidney disease. These mechanisms might contribute to the association of alkalization with reduced kidney functional decline in humans with gout and low urine pH.

### Kidney stone disease: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^f775f079]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract and constitutes a major global health-care problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and enormous health-care expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and low bone mass. Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH. A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations and guide therapy. Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized, underserved and under-researched. Greater awareness and investments in research, innovation and education are urgently needed.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^1f455e1a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3:
Which one of the following conditions is the best explanation for the development of hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis in this patient?

Thiazide diuretic use for hypertension
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Sarcoidosis
Calcium-alkali (milk alkali) syndrome
Hypercalcemia of malignancy

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

The impact of metabolic alkalosis on the body is diverse and includes effects on the central nervous system (ranging from confusion to coma), peripheral nervous system (neuropathic symptoms such as tingling and numbness), myocardium (arrythmia), and skeletal muscle (weakness and twitching), among others. Some of these signs and symptoms could be due to severe electrolyte derangements either consequent to transcellular shifts (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) or secondary to altering the ratio of free to bound ions (calcium). Metabolic alkalosis is divided into 2 major categories based on whether ECF volume status is contracted or expanded (Box 1). Diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis is established by elevation in blood pH above 7.44 in the setting of high serum HCO 3 − concentration. Arterial blood gas (ABG), or a VBG at a minimum, is required if the diagnosis is in doubt (Fig 6).

A comprehensive patient history can uncover potential causes of metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting or excessive intake of diuretics, laxatives, exogenous HCO 3 −, or licorice. The history can also provide clues toward the presence of diseases such as primary aldosteronism, cystic fibrosis, or possible alkalosis-provoking medications (penicillin, carbenicillins, etc). Physical examination can help in establishing ECF volume contraction. A basic chemistry profile for Na +, K +, Cl −, Mg2 +, SUN, and Scr assists in evaluating kidney function and may provide clues toward the causes of alkalosis.

Based on the systemic blood pressure and urine electrolytes, patients with metabolic alkalosis are divided into chloride-sensitive (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) and chloride-resistant (urine Cl − > 20 mmol/L) groups (Fig 6).

### The key role of major and trace elements in the formation of five common urinary stones [^e9d296cf]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary stones comprise approximately 40 components, with the primary chemical constituents of stones being CO, calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite and CA), UA, Cystine and struvite. CO emerges as the most prevalent mineral phase in uroliths, occurring with a frequency of around 70–75%. Calcium phosphate stones are divided into hydroxyapatite and CA, and their lithogenic effect depends on urinary pH and Ca concentration. Considering the reduced solubility of calcium phosphate in alkaline conditions, excess excretion of urinary Ca combined with alkaline urine (pH > 6.0) favors the formation of calcium phosphate stones. The prevalence of UA stones worldwide is approximately 10–15%. Risk factors for UA stone formation include conditions associated with elevated urinary UA concentration, low urine volume, and low urinary pH. Struvite stones, commonly referred to as infectious stones, appear to be associated with urinary tract infections. The infectious stones involved the bacteria activities that enhance or inhibit the crystallization process like nucleation and crystal growth. Elevated cystine concentration can lead to cystine precipitation and the formation of cystine stones, with a prevalence of less than 1% worldwide. The vast majority of urinary stones contain two or more components, with various combinations. A study showed that urinary stones are mainly composed of two components (50.9%), followed by single-component stones (27.1%) and three-component stones (21.9%). Microscopically, mixed-type stones exhibit a greater variety of crystal growth patterns, with more irregular and diverse shapes and structures. The formation of urinary stones typically initiates with an elevation in the concentration of certain solutes in urine, leading to a state of supersaturation. The solutes in this supersaturated urine gradually crystallize, forming minute particles that progressively grow into solid cores. These cores aggregate over time, culminating in the development of complete urinary stones, which may accumulate within the urinary stones and eventually be expelled through the urethra, causing symptoms of urinary tract stones. Despite an incomplete understanding of the stone precipitation process, urinary stone analysis plays a crucial role in identifying the potential etiology and pathophysiology of stone formation. This, in turn, can contribute to efforts to prevent the formation of urinary stones.

Analyzing the elements in urinary stones is crucial for studying urinary stone formation. However, there have been few comparative studies on the elemental behaviors of different types of urinary stones. This study aims to explore the elemental characteristics of five common types of urinary stones through correlation analysis and PCA. We hope to provide reference data for the treatment and prevention of urinary stone diseases.

### Metabolic acidosis [^b9a00dbc]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis occurs in a number of diseases and even certain normal activities such as heavy exercise. It arises from increased endogenous acid production, exogenous acid (or acid-precursor) administration, base losses, and depression of renal acid secretion. Although the magnitude of acidosis is important, the ultimate pathophysiological impact of any metabolic acidosis is defined by the rate of change and the specific cause of the acidosis. This review discusses whole body, organ, and cellular effects of metabolic acidosis, its diagnosis by pathophysiologic categories, and treatment. The diagnosis is made by a synthesis of the clinical history, physical examination, other hematological values, serum and urinary chemistries, and arterial blood gases and electrolytes. Calculation of the anion and osmolal gaps can be effectively used to further narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Supportive care and therapy directed at the cause of the metabolic acidosis are the mainstays of treatment, since most acidotic states will spontaneously correct once the initiating cause is removed or reversed. Theoretical and clinical evidence are discussed for alkalinizing agents, whose use remains controversial except in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with hyperkalemia and certain drug or toxin ingestions.

### Empagliflozin in nondiabetic individuals with calcium and uric acid kidney stones: a randomized phase 2 trial [^a116594f]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the activity of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), the main sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption pathway in the proximal tubule. Inhibition of NHE3 is expected to decrease paracellular calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and augment urine calcium, which is what we observed in patients with calcium stones receiving empagliflozin. This effect was not observed in patients with UA stones receiving empagliflozin, suggesting that patients with high baseline urine calcium are more prone to develop SGLT2 inhibition-associated increases in urine calcium. Importantly, however, the protective rise in urine citrate greatly exceeded the increase of urine calcium observed in patients with calcium stones receiving empagliflozin.

SGLT2 inhibitors are uricosuric and lower plasma UA, which has raised concerns regarding increased risks for UA stone formation. The exact mechanism of the uricosuric effect is debated, but seems to be coupled to glucosuria in both rodent and human studies, with increased UA excretion from day 1 of treatment. We now provide clinical trial evidence that, despite decreasing plasma UA, empagliflozin significantly decreases RSR UA in patients with UA kidney stones.

Interestingly, empagliflozin induced differential urine pH changes in patients with calcium and UA kidney stones. Urine pH was clamped to 5.6 with empagliflozin in both groups of patients, resulting in an increase in urine pH in patients with UA stones and a decrease in urine pH in patients with calcium stones. Given the importance of pH for RSR CaP and RSR UA, these differential urine pH changes probably had a substantial impact on the beneficial changes in RSR CaP and RSR UA observed in patients with calcium and UA kidney stones, respectively. We can only speculate on the mechanism underlying the differential effect on urine pH. Although NGIA increased in both groups of patients treated with empagliflozin, NAE was lower in patients with UA kidney stones and higher in patients with calcium kidney stones treated with empagliflozin. Thus, empagliflozin seems to exhibit differential effects on endogenous acid generation and increased intestinal alkali absorption in the two groups of patients.

### Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate [^413f77f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

With normal urine pHs, approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and approximately another 30 to 40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself. Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9.9, urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates. Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration rates, indicating the involvement of active secretion. Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1 to 75%, depending on urinary pH, with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically metabolized. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in prolonged exposures. In addition, drugs that effect urinary pH are known to alter the elimination of amphetamine, and any decrease in amphetamine's metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when renal elimination is decreased [see Drug Interactions (7)].

 Special Populations

Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of d- and l-amphetamine after oral administration of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules in children (6 to 12 years) and adolescent (13 to 17 years) ADHD patients and healthy adult volunteers indicates that body weight is the primary determinant of apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of d- and l-amphetamine across the age range. Systemic exposure measured by area under the curve to infinity (AUC∞) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) decreased with increases in body weight, while oral volume of distribution (VZ/F), oral clearance (CL/F), and elimination half-life (t1/2) increased with increases in body weight.

### Memantine (memantine hydrochloride) [^0985df08]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	Drugs That Make Urine Alkaline

The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.

7.2	Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists

The combined use of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.

Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.

7.2 Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists

The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.

### Studies to identify the basis for an alkaline urine pH in patients with calcium hydrogen phosphate kidney stones [^1ad6ea52]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with CaHPO(4) kidney stones belong to a diagnostic category that has a high urine pH as its common feature. Our objective was to provide a new clinical approach to examine the basis for this high pH.

Methods

The study group consisted of 26 CaHPO(4) stone formers and 28 normal volunteers. Urine was collected q2h plus an overnight sample to identify patients with a urine pH > 6.5 for 12/24 h. Urine ammonium (U(NH4)), sulphate (U(SO4)) and citrate were measured and diet net alkali was calculated.

Results

Of the 26 patients, 13 had persistently alkaline urine. In 7/13, U(NH4) (68 ± 13 mEq/day) and U(SO4) (57 ± 7 mEq/day) were both high. In 6/13 patients, U(NH4) was the usual 31 ± 3 mEq/day; in 4/6, U(NH4)/U(SO4) was 0.9 ± 0.1; the cause of the alkaline urine pH seemed to be a dietary alkali load because the rise in urine pH was episodic and coincided with a high net diet alkali load and peak citrate excretion rates. The remaining two patients had a high U(NH4)/U(SO4) (2.2 and 1.6). Citrate excretion was very low in the male, but not in the female patient.

Conclusions

There are heterogeneous causes for a persistently high urine pH. Two of the patients had a possible molecular basis: the lesion could be a low proximal convoluted tubule cell pH in the male and an increased entry of NH(3) into the late distal nephron in the female.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^a6f8980c]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urine, a final product of nephron function which consists of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, provides valuable information about numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Urine dipstick tests are routinely used as a diagnostic tool in medical practice, facilitating early detection of diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTI), and renal and metabolic disorders. Urine dipstick measurements are semiquantitative traits; positive urine dipstick results are expressed as intervals (e.g. pH and specific gravity) or graded according to severity on a scale from 1 to 4 plus (written as + to ++++; e.g. proteinuria and hematuria), and require medical interpretation. Apart from various diseases, environmental factors, such as exercise and food supplements, are known to affect urine dipstick results. However, it is an open question as to how genetic variation influences urine dipstick test results, both in a disease dependent and independent context.

Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of urine dipstick measurements, testing for associations of variants in the sequence of the genome with glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria, urine pH, signs of UTI (i.e. nitrites and leukocyte esterase) and urine specific gravity in a set of 150 274 Icelanders. In addition, we assess the variants detected for association with a broad set of diseases and other biological traits. By doing so, we attempt to shed light on whether the variants that affect urine dipstick test results are associated with specific diseases, or if they simply affect urinary traits separate from everything else.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Drugs that Make the Urine Alkaline

The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract).

### Association between the markers of metabolic acid load and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a general population with preserved renal function [^302b31d8]. Hypertension Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although metabolic acid load has been associated with many well-known risk factors for mortality, its clinical implications are not yet clear. To evaluate the association between biomarkers of metabolic acid load, such as serum bicarbonate, serum anion gap and urine pH and mortality, we analyzed the health records of 31,590 adults who underwent a health screening between January 2001 and December 2010 and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate ⩾60mlmin(-1) per 1.73m2. Urine pH was measured by a dipstick test performed on fast morning urine sample and categorized as acidic (urine pH ≤ 5.5), neutral and alkaline (urine pH ⩾8.0). Using the Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause mortality of the lowest quartile of serum bicarbonate was 1.460 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.068–1.995) compared with the highest quartile, after a median follow-up of 93 months. The aHRs of cardiovascular and cancer mortality of the lowest quartile of serum bicarbonate were 2.647 (95% CI 1.148–6.103) and 1.604 (95% CI 1.024–2.513), respectively, compared with the highest quartile. Acidic and neutral urine pH were significantly associated with a higher all-cause mortality (aHR 2.550, 95% CI 1.316–4.935; aHR 2.376 95% CI 1.254–4.501, respectively), compared with an alkaline urine pH. In conclusion, higher metabolic acid load was associated with an increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a healthy population. The association between metabolic acid load and mortality and the causality of the relationship need to be confirmed.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^3f533989]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^c0a265c2]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence identifies acidosis not only as a consequence of, but as a contributor to, kidney disease progression. Several mechanistic pathways have been identified in this regard. The dietary acid load, even in the absence of overt acidosis, may have deleterious effects. Several small trials now suggest that the treatment of acidosis with oral alkali can slow the progression of kidney disease.

### Sugar-induced obesity and insulin resistance are uncoupled from shortened survival in drosophila [^b18717e5]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple factors contribute to uric acid stone formation, including uric acid concentration and pH. First, we measured circulating uric acid levels in the fly hemolymph in response to a high-sugar diet. The concentration of uric acid was significantly increased at d28 on the 20%S diet, exacerbated by the hemolymph dehydration, and was rescued back to control levels by water supplementation (Figures 5 J and S5 F). Second, since uric acid crystallization is favored at acidic pH, we assessed hemolymph and urine pH in response to a high-sugar diet. Despite the significantly decreased hemolymph volume, we did not detect changes in hemolymph pH at d28 (Figure S5 G), suggesting tight homeostatic control. Next, to assess urine pH, we supplemented the fly food with a pH indicator dye. Since in Drosophila the renal tubules connect to the digestive tract at the hindgut (see Figure 5 A), the deposits produced by the fly are combined urine and feces. Consistent with previous observations, dissection of the digestive tract from dye-fed flies confirmed acidification of the hindgut posterior to the tubules (Figure 5 K). Moreover, our excreta analysis revealed pronounced acidification of deposits in response to the 20%S food (Figures 5 L and S5 H). Therefore, the high-sugar diet results in both elevated uric acid levels and acidified conditions, which promote uric acid stone formation.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^dd26b342]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

TmP/GFR is determined using either a fasting second morning void or a 2-hour morning urine collection, with concurrent measures of serum and urine phosphorus and creatinine. TmP/GFR is also higher in infants and children than in adults; in general, the normal TmP/GFR ranges at any age are similar to the normal serum phosphorus ranges for age. While a nomogram or an algorithm may be used to determine TmP/GFR, these are less accurate in children, and the nomogram does not incorporate the full pediatric normal range. We suggest using the following equation for TmP/GFR in children: TmP/GFR = serum phosphate – [(urine phosphate × serum creatinine)/urine creatinine]. This equation has the advantage of performing similarly in fasting and nonfasting conditions, which is useful in young children and in those with afternoon clinical appointments. A high TmP/GFR indicates appropriate renal phosphate conservation (thus a gastrointestinal or dietary cause of hypophosphatemia), while low TmP/GFR indicates inappropriate renal phosphate wasting.

High or high–normal FGF23 levels support an FGF23-mediated cause. However, the diagnosis is often clear without FGF23 measurements. In XLH and other FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia, 1,25(OH) 2 D is often low or low–normal but is often high in non-FGF23–mediated hypophosphatemia. Hypercalciuria in the untreated patient often indicates a non-FGF23–mediated cause such as HHRH or Fanconi syndrome. However, treatment with vitamin D or calcitriol also can cause hypercalciuria. Unless the family history indicates an FGF23-mediated cause, it is critical to evaluate for generalized proximal renal tubulopathies (including Fanconi syndromes, Dent disease, and others) by performing urinalysis (such as urine dipstick) and additional urine studies paying key attention to elevated urine pH (suggesting bicarbonaturia), glucosuria, albuminuria or general proteinuria, amino aciduria or loss of other substrates, in addition to urine calcium, and urine phosphorus. High urinary albumin and low molecular weight protein excretion (eg, alpha-1 microglobulin, beta-2-microglobulin, retinol-binding protein) may suggest Dent disease or other tubulopathies.

### Impact of adding urine alkalization therapy to xanthine oxidase inhibitor in gout management: a prospective cohort study [^3248ab44]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of MSU crystals in joint and non-joint tissues. Low urine pH is common in people with gout; a cross-sectional study involving 3565 people with primary gout reported that 76.2% had low urine pH (pH < 6.2). Low urine pH is independently linked to various kidney diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney stones, kidney cysts, microhematuria, and proteinuria. Moreover, low urine pH directly affects the formation of MSU crystals in renal tubules and is associated with tubulointerstitial injury leading to proteinuria.

There is also a complex interplay between metabolic syndrome (MetS), low urine pH and hyperuricaemia/gout. Together with hyperuricaemia, low urine pH is a predictive risk factor for MetS, which associates with low urine pH and is common among people with gout, ranging from 30.1% to 82.0%. A small study has suggested that the combination of allopurinol together with urine alkalization using citrate improves the lipid profile of people with hyperuricaemia.

Currently, treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is the key strategy for gout management. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) are strongly recommended as first-line ULT drugs. Previous research has demonstrated that combining citrate preparations with allopurinol can lower serum urate (SU) level, improve kidney function, and enhance treatment efficacy in patients with hyperuricaemia. However, there is no consensus on the use of urine alkalization in gout management guidelines. Some guidelines recommended urine alkalization in limited clinical settings, while the 2020 ACR gout management guideline did not find sufficient evidence to recommend it when using uricosuric treatment.

Given the prior findings suggesting beneficial effects of alkalization for certain comorbidities in gout management, this study investigated whether the addition of urine alkalization to ULT is associated with improvements in albuminuria, gout flares or metabolic outcomes in men with gout and low urinary pH (pH < 6.2).

### Potassium citrate [^d6eadef6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Potassium citrate therapy does not alter the urinary saturation of calcium phosphate, since the effect of increased citrate complexation of calcium is opposed by the rise in pH-dependent dissociation of phosphate. Calcium phosphate stones are more stable in alkaline urine.

In the setting of normal renal function, the rise in urinary citrate following a single dose begins by the first hour and lasts for 12 hours. With multiple doses the rise in citrate excretion reaches its peak by the third day and averts the normally wide circadian fluctuation in urinary citrate, thus maintaining urinary citrate at a higher, more constant level throughout the day. When the treatment is withdrawn, urinary citrate begins to decline toward the pre-treatment level on the first day.

The rise in citrate excretion is directly dependent on the potassium citrate dosage. Following long-term treatment, potassium citrate at a dosage of 60 mEq/day raises urinary citrate by approximately 400 mg/day and increases urinary pH by approximately 0.7 units.

In patients with severe renal tubular acidosis or chronic diarrheal syndrome where urinary citrate may be very low (< 100 mg/day), potassium citrate may be relatively ineffective in raising urinary citrate. A higher dose of potassium citrate may therefore be required to produce a satisfactory citraturic response. In patients with renal tubular acidosis in whom urinary pH may be high, potassium citrate produces a relatively small rise in urinary pH.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^cf444941]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate]), and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration. For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

Consider administering sodium bicarbonate to set the urine pH to 6.4–6.8 for optimal uric acid clearance. Recognize that allopurinol may increase the risk of xanthine accumulation with renal failure and restrict its use to patients with symptomatic hyperuricemia.

### Potassium citrate (Urocit-K) [^0d5ec513]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Urocit®-K therapy does not alter the urinary saturation of calcium phosphate, since the effect of increased citrate complexation of calcium is opposed by the rise in pH-dependent dissociation of phosphate. Calcium phosphate stones are more stable in alkaline urine.

In the setting of normal renal function, the rise in urinary citrate following a single dose begins by the first hour and lasts for 12 hours.

A higher dose of Urocit®-K may therefore be required to produce a satisfactory citraturic response. In patients with renal tubular acidosis in whom urinary pH may be high, Urocit®-K produces a relatively small rise in urinary pH.

### A woman with recurrent calcium phosphate kidney stones [^1cfa2938]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Kidney stones composed predominantly (50% or more) of calcium phosphate constitute up to 10% of all stones and 15%-20% of calcium stones, 80% of which are composed of calcium oxalate. Calcium phosphate is a minor component of up to 30% of calcium oxalate stones as well. The cause of calcium phosphate stones is often obscure but most often related to a high urine pH. Some patients with calcium phosphate stones may have incomplete renal tubular acidosis. Others have distal renal tubular acidosis characterized by hyperchloremic acidosis, hypocitraturia, and high urine pH. The use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, topiramate, and zonisamide leads to a similar picture. Treatment options to specifically prevent calcium phosphate stone recurrence have not been tested in clinical trials. Increases in urine volume and restriction of sodium intake to limit calcium excretion are important. Citrate supplementation is probably effective, although the concomitant increase in urine pH may increase calcium phosphate supersaturation and partially offset the inhibition of crystallization resulting from the increased urine citrate excretion and the alkali-associated reduction in urine calcium excretion. Thiazides lower urine calcium excretion and may help ensure the safety of citrate supplementation.

### Acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) [^fd429205]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

 WHAT IS LITHOSTAT? LITHOSTAT®is a drug which prevents the excessive buildup of ammonia in your urine, which controls the acidity and alkalinity (pH) of your urine. The cause of excessive ammonia and alkalinity in your urine is a bacterial infection.

WHAT CAN LITHOSTAT DO? Treatment with LITHOSTAT®is prescribed to decrease urinary ammonia. This may increase the chance of controlling your infection with antibiotics and may help the treatment of your kidney stones. Dissolution of existing stones is unlikely.

LITHOSTAT®should not be used in place of surgical treatment. Surgical removal of all stones and elimination of all infection with antibiotics offers the possibility of curative treatment. LITHOSTAT®is likely to be more effective after large stones or obstructing stones have been removed.

WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OR SIDE EFFECTS WITH LITHOSTAT? The complete spectrum of side effects induced by LITHOSTAT®(acetohydroxamic acid) is unknown. However, some side effects which have been reported to date have been headaches, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of hair, shakiness, and anemia. Lifethreatening problems (blood clot in the legs) occurred in several patients with advanced disease in early investigation. In more extensive later investigations, this problem has not occurred. No patient has died as a consequence of taking LITHOSTAT®. The most serious side effects seem to occur in patients with poor kidney function and/or in patients with a previous history of these conditions.

### Acidosis and urinary calcium excretion: insights from genetic disorders [^451aa7e1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion and related sequelae, including nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. The increased urinary calcium excretion induced by metabolic acidosis predominantly results from increased mobilization of calcium out of bone and inhibition of calcium transport processes within the renal tubule. The mechanisms whereby acid alters the integrity and stability of bone have been examined extensively in the published literature. Here, after briefly reviewing this literature, we consider the effects of acid on calcium transport in the renal tubule and then discuss why not all gene defects that cause renal tubular acidosis are associated with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.

### The case for a ketogenic diet in the management of kidney disease [^e454017e]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Uric acid stones are the most frequently reported by individuals on a ketogenic diet, followed by calcium oxalate stones or mixed stones with calcium and uric acid. A ketogenic diet transiently increases uric acid concentration 25%–50%, which usually peaks at 2–4 weeks, and gradually returns to prediet levels by 8 weeks. The initial rise in uric acid is concomitant with the rise in ketones, and it was postulated that the reason for this may be competition between uric acid and ketones for the same organic acid transporters, which are required for renal excretion. After several weeks, the kidney conserves ketones, presumably allowing for return of normal renal uric acid excretion and serum levels.

There may be effective strategies to mitigate the kidney stone risk in patients following a ketogenic diet. Increasing fluid intake to maintain dilute urine limits the possibility of mineral crystallization. Urine alkalinization, particularly addressing hypocitraturia, may inhibit supersaturation of calcium salts and aggregation. Moreover, studies of kidney stones have largely precluded patients with CKD where their urine parameters change alongside diminishing kidney function. A retrospective study of 811 patients with kidney stones noted that advancing kidney disease afforded reduced calcium stone formation, presumably due to reduced calciuriaand increased uric acid stone formation. Metabolic acidosis resulting in acidic urine pH is common among individuals with CKD. Low urine pH is a well-known risk factor for forming uric acid kidney stones due to the low solubility of uric acidic in acidic conditions. At the same time, low urine pH leads to hypocitraturia which increases the risk of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones. Hence, future examination of how a ketogenic diet impacts the incidence of kidney stones among patients with T2D and CKD is paramount. Being aware of and addressing the potential kidney stone risk with well-established measures — such as urine alkalization, correcting hypocitraturia, and increasing fluid intake — is prudent. Additionally, understanding that diet-imposed change in risk through modulation of ammonia excretion, uricosuria, calciuria, citraturia, and other urinary parameters will assist with future guidance.

### Neglected analytes in the 24-h urine: ammonium and sulfate [^fbd22ebe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Evaluation of the kidney stone patient includes measurement of 24 h urine chemistries. This review summarizes the application of physiologic principles to the interpretation of urine chemistries, using sulfate and ammonium to estimate diet acid load, and the renal response.

Recent Findings

There has been increased recognition of the need to measure urine ammonium excretion in the clinical setting in order to understand renal acid excretion. Some 24 h urine kidney stone panels include ammonium measurements, providing an opportunity to apply this measurement to clinical practice. In order to better interpret ammonium excretion, one needs an estimate of dietary acid load to understand the driving forces for ammonium excretion. Sulfate is also included in some kidney stone panels and functions as an estimate of diet acid load. Combining these analytes with urine pH, the clinician can quickly estimate dietary stone risk as well as potential bowel disease, acidification disorders, and the presence of urease producing bacteria; all of which can affect stone risk.

Summary

Measurement of ammonium and sulfate excretion along with urine pH provide important insights into the acid/alkali content of diet, presence and severity of bowel disease, presence of renal acidification disorders, and urinary infection.

### The diurnal variation in urine acidification differs between normal individuals and uric acid stone formers [^bc0f81b8]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Many biological functions follow circadian rhythms driven by internal and external cues that synchronize and coordinate organ physiology to diurnal changes in the environment and behavior. Urinary acid-base parameters follow diurnal patterns and it is thought these changes are due to periodic surges in gastric acid secretion. Abnormal urine pH is a risk factor for specific types of nephrolithiasis and uric acid stones result from excessively low urine pH. Here we placed 9 healthy volunteers and 10 uric acid stone formers on fixed metabolic diets to study the diurnal pattern of urinary acidification. All showed clear diurnal trends in urinary acidification, but none of the patterns were affected by inhibitors of the gastric proton pump. Uric acid stone formers had similar patterns of change throughout the day but their urine pH was always lower compared to healthy volunteers. Uric acid stone formers excreted more acid (normalized to acid ingestion), with the excess excreted primarily as titratable acid rather than ammonium. Urine base excretion was also lower in uric acid stone formers (normalized to base ingestion), along with lower plasma bicarbonate concentrations during part of the day. Thus, increased net acid presentation to the kidney and the preferential use of buffers, other than ammonium, result in much higher concentrations of undissociated uric acid throughout the day and consequently an increased risk of uric acid stones.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^593d217f]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology leading to acidosis in CKD

Under normal conditions, the extracellular H + concentration is tightly regulated and varies little from the normal value of approximately 40 nanomol/L. Regulation of acid–base homeostasis involves three basic steps: chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers, alteration of alveolar ventilation, and changes in renal H + excretion. The kidneys regulate H + excretion by reabsorbing filtered HCO 3 − and generating new HCO 3 − in response to various stimuli. Secreted H + combine with urinary buffers such as HPO 4 2− and ammonia. In CKD the reduction in functioning nephrons causes defects in renal excretion of acid, mainly in the form of ammonium. A fraction of patients may have inappropriate bicarbonate wasting in the urine.

The acidosis in CKD usually remains relatively stable. In uncomplicated acidosis, the serum bicarbonate levels typically are > 12 mEq/L and blood pH is > 7.2. There are two general possibilities for this stabilization of serum bicarbonate levels. One is that after an initial period of acid retention, the excretion and production of acid equalize. The other possibility is that acidosis evokes extrarenal mechanisms that dispose of the endogenous acid not excreted in the urine. The major source of such buffering would be base derived from bone. Carefully conducted balance studies in CKD patients with acidosis found a positive acid balance of approximately 10–20 mEq per day and negative calcium balance that improved with correction of acidosis. However, the degree of acid retention has been debated, with the suggestion that these findings resulted from systematic measurement error. While the magnitude of acid retention may be less than reported, it seems likely that acid production does exceed excretion in the setting of chronic renal acidosis.

The acidosis in mild to moderate CKD is predominantly hyperchloremic, with an increased anion gap observed variably and generally only with advanced CKD. However, accounting for changes in serum albumin and other electrolytes in the anion gap calculation reveals a slightly more nuanced view. This maneuver reveals minor elevations in the anion gap, which are associated with decrements in serum bicarbonate, even in the CKD stage 2 eGFR range. Although small, these differences in anion gap are independently associated with mortality. Thus, there may be low-level accumulation of organic solutes even when the GFR is relatively preserved that partially accounts for changes in the serum bicarbonate level.

### Memantine hydrochloride tablets (generic drug) [^b2654673]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Drugs that Make the Urine Alkaline

The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8.

Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.

7.2 Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists

The combined use of Memantine Hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^e87a2b70]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

K + secretion through the renal outer medullary potassium channel in the distal nephron is modulated by pH such that metabolic acidosis inhibits, while metabolic alkalosis stimulates, K + secretion.SGLT2is have the potential to augment K + secretion by alkalinizing the fluid entering the distal nephron. In rodent models, empagliflozin increases urinary excretion HCO 3 − and raises urine pH through an inhibitory effect on NHE3 in the proximal tubule. In addition, the increase in plasma glucagon after SGLT2i may further increase urine pH through an inhibitory effect on HCO 3 − reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. Because metabolic acidosis is not a feature of chronic SGLT2i therapy, increased kidney ammoniagenesis likely compensates for the inhibitory effect on HCO 3 − reabsorption.

### Does urinary pH and diet influence the rate of urinary tract infection recurrence after electrofulguration in women with antibiotic-recalcitrant recurrent urinary tract infections? [^893341d2]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess if urine acidity may be preventative against urinary tract infection (UTIs) and affected by diet. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of urine pH on the rate of recurrent UTIs (RUTIs) after electrofulguration (EF) in 3 groups of women with different urine pH ranges as well as the relation between their diet composition and urine pH.

Methods

In a prior IRB-approved prospective study, women recorded urinary pH 4 times a day and diet for a week. Three urinary pH groups were identified: never below 6, never above 6, and above and below 6. In this study, a 3-day diet analysis involved categorizing different foods by acidity based on pH food charts and calculating amounts consumed using a nutritional analysis database. Rate of UTIs after EF and urine pH after consumption of acidic foods was compared between urine pH groups. Our hypothesis was that low urinary pH protects against RUTIs.

Results

Of 37/69 patients who underwent EF with long median follow-up duration (4–6 years), no difference was found among the groups for UTI frequency, rate, and culture characteristics. There was a no significant difference in the mean amount of acidic foods eaten and the urine pH after each meal as well as in total.

Conclusions

During long-term follow-up, no association was found between urine pH groups and acidic food intake, and rates of UTIs after EF, possibly because of no link between urine pH and UTIs or EF already provokes an important reduction in rates of UTIs.

### The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens [^530d0e55]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection.

Materials and Methods

This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5–8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P < .05).

Results

For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the β-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH.

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^e3fb5b89]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The UOG, in contrast to the urine anion gap, is not invalidated by increased excretion of unmeasured anions and therefore is the preferred measure to further analyze the causes for hyperchloremic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Type 1 (distal) RTA is based on defective distal tubular H+ secretion and is characterized by inadequately high urinary pH (> 5.3) during hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In type II (proximal) RTA the underlying cause is a defect in proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption. This results in urinary bicarbonate loss also resulting in inappropriately high urine pH during hyperchloremic acidosis. However, in established type II RTA, after severe bicarbonate depletion has occurred, minimum urinary pH is usually below pH 5.3. Type IV RTA is based on mineralocorticoid deficiency or inadequate renal response to mineralocorticoids. It is characterized by low urinary pH and - contrary to RTA types I/II - hyperkalemia.

The prevalence of RTA and underlying metabolic changes has been studied in patients after kidney transplantation and in osteoporotic patients. However, studies in critically ill patients are lacking.

Based on the physical-chemical approach, more than one metabolic acid-base disorder at the same time was found to be common in critical illness. Thus, 'metabolic acidosis' and 'metabolic alkalosis' may be present in the same patient at the same time, potentially leading to normal pH values. The terms 'acidosis' and 'alkalosis' are defined as separate effects that decrease or increase arterial pH, respectively, whereas 'acidemia' and 'alkalemia' are defined as net arterial pH < 7.35 or > 7.45, respectively.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients and to analyze the underlying acid-base state using a physical-chemical approach according to Gilfix et al.

### Sodium phosphate cotransporter 2a inhibitors: potential therapeutic uses [^1a54031d]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

ADAPTATION OF RENAL P i TRANSPORTERS IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

In CKD, renal function declines gradually with age, showing a reduction in nephron numbers and elevated FGF23 and PTH levels. These changes can potentially downregulate Npt2a/c expression. Supporting this theory, adenine-induced CKD animal models show markedly reduced Npt2a expression at the protein and mRNA levels. Consistently, in rats and mice with reduced kidney function (5/6 Nx), a substantial reduction in Npt2a mRNA expression is also observed. Additionally, Npt2a activity is affected by urine pH: more alkaline urine increases Npt2a activity. Notably, CKD is characterized by low urine pH, possibly associated with lower Npt2a activity. Therefore, these observations need to be considered when targeting renal Na + /P i cotransporters as therapeutic strategies.

### Urine electrolytes in the intensive care unit: from pathophysiology to clinical practice [^bc3ca318]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of urine concentrations of sodium, chloride, and potassium is a widely available, rapid, and low-cost diagnostic option for the management of critically ill patients. Urine electrolytes have long been suggested in the diagnostic workup of hypovolemia, kidney injury, and acid-base and electrolyte disturbances. However, due to the wide range of normal reference values and challenges in interpretation, their use is controversial. To clarify their potential role in managing critical patients, we reviewed existing evidence on the use of urine electrolytes for diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation and assessment in critical illness. This review will describe the normal physiology of water and electrolyte excretion, summarize the use of urine electrolytes in hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, acid-base, and electrolyte disorders, and suggest some practical flowcharts for the potential use of urine electrolytes in daily critical care practice.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^065208a3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3¯) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Acid excretion is impaired in calcium oxalate stone formers [^06f44d98]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor,

Urine pH and supersaturation contribute to urine crystal formation. However, how the renal capacity to excrete acid influences the formation of common kidney stone types is not completely understood. Leveraging the extensive urine biochemistry profile available in the Swiss Kidney Stone Cohort (SKSC), we tested whether urinary acid–base (AB) parameters, including pH, ammonium, titratable acidity (TA), net acid excretion (NAE) and citrate, were associated with the presence of calcium oxalate (CaOx) and calcium phosphate (CaP) stones. We assessed the kidney's capacity of excreting acids by calculating an index that determines how much net acid is excreted in relation to urine pH, which was previously termed as net acid excretion capacity (NAEC). The NAEC is obtained from the residuals of the relation between net acid excretion and urine pH. A similar ammonium-to-pH index, the AB score, was recently validated in chronic kidney disease. We also included titratable acid and gastrointestinal alkali absorption in our analyses as similarly done in Ferraro et al.

The SKSC is a prospective, multicentric, longitudinal cohort of patients with kidney stones. Participants with kidney stone disease [stone formers (SFs)] were followed for 3 years to collect blood, urine samples and clinical data. This analysis used baseline data collected 2 weeks after screening, with the last stone episode occurring 6–17 weeks prior to baseline (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Stone composition was determined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A control group [non–stone formers (NSFs)], confirmed by computed tomography (CT) to be free of kidney stones and calcifications, was also recruited. Exclusion criteria specific to this study are in Supplementary Fig. S1. Biochemical parameters were measured as described in Bonny et al. with participants eating their usual diet, and data analysis was conducted using R/RStudio (Posit, Boston, MA, USA).

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

### Hypocitraturia: diagnosis and treatment [^51ab8752]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypocitraturia is one of the most common and correctable risk factors for nephrolithiasis. It is primarily caused by alterations in acid-base status, with several identified etiologies driving its pathogenesis. Diagnosis is made by at least one 24-hour urine study. Treatment involves identifying and reversing potential causes, followed by dietary modifications and alkali supplementation. Numerous new supplements have emerged in this space, gaining availability and popularity with patients. This article reviews pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypocitraturia in the context of urolithiasis.

### Renal tubular acidosis: core curriculum 2025 [^93435fa2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidoses (RTAs) are a subset of non-anion gap metabolic acidoses that result from complex disturbances in renal acid excretion. Net acid excretion is primarily accomplished through the reclamation of sodium bicarbonate and the buffering of secreted protons with ammonia or dibasic phosphate, all of which require a series of highly complex and coordinated processes along the renal tubule. Flaws in any of these components lead to the development of metabolic acidosis and/or a failure to compensate fully for other systemic acidoses. Identification and diagnosis of RTA can be challenging, and the consequences of untreated RTA can be life-threatening. The use of serum and urinary indices can help elucidate the kidney's capacity to respond to acidemia, characterize these disturbances further, and guide treatment.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^518823d0]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy — biological understanding and antibiotic considerations — links pregnancy-related factors to infection risk and potential benefits and harms of treatment. The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse pregnancy outcomes is related to a combination of factors, and pregnancy further increases the risk because of changes in urine pH, bladder compression, and urethral dilation; pyelonephritis in pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons could prevent cases of pyelonephritis and associated negative pregnancy outcomes. Antibiotics are the mainstay treatment for urinary tract infections, but the use of antibiotics is known to lead to antimicrobial resistance, there is emerging evidence that bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts plays a protective role, and antibiotic use can disrupt these effects.

### Archaea in the human microbiome and potential effects on human infectious disease [^4354d463]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary Tract Infections

Traditionally, urine was believed to be sterile; however, current understanding acknowledges the presence of a microbiome in the urogenital tract. This microbiome plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the maintenance of urinary tract health. UTIs commonly arise when microbes from the rectal area enter the urethra, migrating upward into the bladder or other areas of the urinary tract.

Various factors, including sexual activity, urinary tract abnormalities, a weakened immune system, catheter use, and hormonal changes, can elevate the risk of a UTI developing. Bacteria are typically associated with UTIs; however, M. smithii has also been identified as a component of the urinary microbial community. Urine samples containing M. smithii have exhibited the presence of hydrogen-producing enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The consistent co-occurrence suggests a potential role of M. smithii in supporting the dysbiosis by promoting the growth of enterobacteria, which are recognized agents of UTIs.

Vaginosis

Vaginosis refers to an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota, leading to discomfort and noticeable symptoms. The vagina typically hosts microbiota with lower diversity, predominantly consisting of lactobacilli. Vaginosis can arise as a result of changes in vaginal pH or transfer of fecal microbes from the gastrointestinal tract to the vagina. Of note, M. smithii has been identified in patients with vaginosis, and its presence has been proposed as a potential biomarker for this condition. This association is plausible, considering that M. smithii is the most prevalent archaea found in the gastrointestinal tract. Some studies have faced challenges in detecting archaea in samples from both healthy and infected women. It has been suggested that methanogens contribute to vaginal health (C.J. Neumann et al. unpub. data).

Methanogenesis by archaea is believed to play a role in maintaining the pH balance of the vaginal microbiome. Moreover, it helps prevent the accumulation of acidic conditions that could disrupt the vaginal microbiome. Although M. smithii might be among the usual vaginal microbiota, its specific connection to vaginosis requires further investigations for a comprehensive understanding.

### Acid excretion is impaired in calcium oxalate stone formers [^1f8ac053]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Last, healthy kidneys increase calcium excretion in response to an acid load and calcium has been reported to be associated with urine pH and NAE. The correlation between calcium excretion and urine pH was not strong, but was still significant in NSF individuals (R = −0.17, P = 0.017) and it was absent in CaOx SFs (R = −0.07, P = 0.24) and CaP SFs (R = −0.25, P = 0.19) (Fig. 1E). Urine calcium was correlated with urine NAE, ammonium and calculated TA in all three groups, but these correlations were stronger and steeper in CaP SFs in relation to NSFs (Fig. 1 F–H).

The main limitations of our study are the small sample size for CaP SFs, which may have prevented the detection of relevant associations between the presence of CaP stones and AB parameters, the lack of a controlled diet in our studies and the use of calculated instead of measured TA and bicarbonate. However, in the context of this study, calculated has an advantage over measured TA, as it is not affected by the precipitation of calcium phosphate. Significant strengths include extensive urinary biochemical data near stone diagnosis, CT validation of our control group and detailed medication histories.

In summary, our results suggest that a reduction in urine pH not followed by proportional excretion of net acid excretion could either facilitate or be a consequence of CaOx stone deposition. The kidney's capacity for excreting acid and its interaction with calcium excretion are differentially impaired in CaP and CaOx SFs, which most probably reflects different tubular defects involved in stone formation.

### Chronic hepatitis B virus infection increases the risk of upper urinary calculi [^40a9ee8a]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms by which chronic HBV infection promotes the occurrence and development of UUC, especially in patients with high levels of urine pH, are not known. The possible mechanisms may include an imbalance between the kidneys' ability to excrete H + ions and resorb HCO 3 − resulting in elevated urinary pH, which can in turn lead to increased calcium phosphate crystal precipitation. Increased urinary pH might be a potential link between UUC and chronic HBV infection by increasing phosphate saturation in the urine. Presumably, in patients with chronic HBV infection, UUC may be mainly the calcium phosphate type, but to date, no studies have evaluated this aspect.

Direct infection of the renal tubular epithelium by HBV may play a role in the occurrence and development of UUC. Diao et al. proved that HBV can directly infect renal tubular epithelial cells and that the replication of HBV increases the apoptosis of renal tubular cells. In vitro research has demonstrated that by upregulating Fas gene expression, serum from patients infected with hepatitis B virus promotes apoptosis of human proximal renal tubular epithelial cells. Apoptosis and injury of renal tubular epithelial cells were able to induce subsequent stone formation. Some authors have reported that damaged cells develop lesions that induce the retention of particles on the surface of renal papillae, and crystals become attached to damaged renal tubular cells. In addition, both UCC and HBV infection may share a common pathogenesis or exacerbating factors as Porter et al. reported and immunosuppression could promote both HBV infection and urinary tract infections, while pathogens such as E. coli in urine could promote the formation of stones. HBV infection of renal tubular epithelial cells may increase the risk of UUC formation by causing changes in renal tubular acid function or promoting the accumulation and growth of calcium crystals. Further research is needed to verify this interesting hypothesis.

### Acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) [^3faed993]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Acetohydroxamic acid has been evaluated clinically in patients with urea-splitting urinary infections, often accompanied by struvite stone disease, that were recalcitrant to other forms of medical and surgical management. In these clinical trials, AHA reduced the pathologically elevated urinary ammonia and pH levels that result from the hydrolysis of urea by the enzyme, urease.

AHA does not acidify urine directly nor does it have a direct antibacterial effect. The usefulness of reducing ammonia levels and decreasing urinary pH is suggested by single (not yet replicated) clinical trials in which urease inhibition 1) allowed successful antibiotic treatment of urea-splitting Proteus infections after surgical removal of struvite stones in patients not cured by 3 months of antibacterial treatment alone, and 2) reduced the rate of stone growth in patients who were not candidates for surgical removal of stones.

### 24-hour urinary chemistries and kidney stone risk [^f348e2f1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Most previous studies of the relationship between urinary factors and kidney stone risk have either assumed a linear effect of urinary parameters on kidney stone risk or implemented arbitrary thresholds suggesting biologically implausible "all-or-nothing" effects. In addition, little is known about the hierarchy of effects of urinary factors on kidney stone risk. This study evaluated the independent associations between urine chemistries and kidney stone formation and examined their magnitude and shape.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We analyzed 9,045 24-hour urine collections from 6,217 participants of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and Nurses' Health Studies I and II.

Exposure

Urine volume and pH, and concentrations of calcium, citrate, oxalate, potassium, magnesium, uric acid, phosphorus, and sodium.

Outcome

Incident symptomatic kidney stones.

Analytical Approach

Multivariable logistic regression analysis incorporating restricted cubic splines to explore potentially nonlinear relationships between urinary factors and the risk of forming a kidney stone. Optimal inflection point analysis was implemented for each factor, and dominance analysis was performed to establish the relative importance of each urinary factor.

Results

Each urinary factor was significantly associated with stone formation except for urine pH. Higher urinary levels of calcium, oxalate, phosphorus, and sodium were associated with a higher risk of stone formation whereas higher urine volume, uric acid, citrate, potassium, and magnesium were associated with a lower risk. The relationships were substantially linear for urine calcium, uric acid, and sodium. By contrast, the magnitudes of the relationships were modestly attenuated at levels above the inflection points for urine oxalate, citrate, volume, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Dominance analysis identified 3 categories of factors' relative importance: higher (calcium, volume, and citrate), intermediate (oxalate, potassium, and magnesium), and lower (uric acid, phosphorus, and sodium).

Limitations

Predominantly White participants, lack of information on stone composition.

Conclusions

Urine chemistries have complex relationships and differential relative associations with the risk of kidney stone formation.

Plain-Language Summary

Kidney stones are common and likely to recur. Certain urinary factors play a role in the development of stones, but their independent roles, relative importance, and shapes of association with stone formation are not well-characterized. We analyzed 24-hour urine collections from individuals with and without kidney stones. Stones were less likely in those with higher urine volume, citrate, potassium, magnesium, and uric acid and were more likely in those with higher calcium, oxalate, phosphorus, and sodium. The acidity of the urine was not related to stones. The urinary parameters showed different degrees of relative importance, with calcium, volume, and citrate being greatest. All parameters exhibited a linear or close-to-linear shape of association with stone formation.

### Beyond the urine anion gap: in support of the direct measurement of urinary ammonium [^6dc09f62]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Ammonium is a major urinary buffer that is necessary for the normal excretion of the daily acid load. Its urinary rate of excretion (UNH 4) may be increased several fold in the presence of extrarenal metabolic acidosis. Therefore, measurement of UNH 4 can provide important clues about causes of metabolic acidosis. Because UNH 4 is not commonly measured in clinical laboratories, the urinary anion gap (UAG) was proposed as its surrogate about 4 decades ago, and it is still frequently used for that purpose. Several published studies strongly suggest that UAG is not a good index of UNH 4 and support the concept that direct measurement of UNH 4 is an important parameter to define in clinical nephrology. Low UNH 4 levels have recently been found to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic acidosis, loss of kidney function, and death in persons with chronic kidney disease, while surrogates like the UAG do not recapitulate this risk. In order to advance the field it is necessary for the medical community to become more familiar with UNH 4 levels in a variety of clinical settings. Herein, we review the literature, searching for available data on UNH 4 under normal and various pathological conditions, in an attempt to establish reference values to interpret UNH 4 results if and when UNH 4 measurements become available as a routine clinical test. In addition, we present original data in 2 large populations that provide further evidence that the UAG is not a good predictor of UNH 4. Measurement of urine NH 4 holds promise to aid clinicians in the care of patients, and we encourage further research to determine its best diagnostic usage.

### Machine learning models to predict 24 hour urinary abnormalities for kidney stone disease [^a9a9e366]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To help guide empiric therapy for kidney stone disease, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of predicting 24-hour urine abnormalities using machine learning methods.

Methods

We trained a machine learning model (XGBoost [XG]) to predict 24-hour urine abnormalities from electronic health record-derived data (n = 1314). The machine learning model was compared to a logistic regression model [LR]. Additionally, an ensemble (EN) model combining both XG and LR models was evaluated as well. Models predicted binary 24-hour urine values for volume, sodium, oxalate, calcium, uric acid, and citrate; as well as a multiclass prediction of pH. We evaluated performance using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC) and identified predictors for each model.

Results

The XG model was able to discriminate 24-hour urine abnormalities with fair performance, comparable to LR. The XG model most accurately predicted abnormalities of urine volume (accuracy = 98%, AUC-ROC = 0.59), uric acid (69%, 0.73) and elevated urine sodium (71%, 0.79). The LR model outperformed the XG model alone in prediction of abnormalities of urinary pH (AUC-ROC of 0.66 vs 0.57) and citrate (0.69 vs 0.64). The EN model most accurately predicted abnormalities of oxalate (accuracy = 65%, ROC-AUC = 0.70) and citrate (65%, 0.69) with overall similar predictive performance to either XG or LR alone. Body mass index, age, and gender were the three most important features for training the models for all outcomes.

Conclusion

Urine chemistry prediction for kidney stone disease appears to be feasible with machine learning methods. Further optimization of the performance could facilitate dietary or pharmacologic prevention.

### Malic acid supplementation increases urinary citrate excretion and urinary pH: implications for the potential treatment of calcium oxalate stone disease [^b22b74c9]. Journal of Endourology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Raising urinary pH and citrate excretion with alkali citrate therapy has been a widely used treatment in calcium nephrolithiasis. Citrate lowers ionized Ca(+2) concentrations and inhibits calcium salt precipitation. Conservative alternatives containing citrate such as fruit juices have been investigated and recommended. Any compound that induces systemic alkalosis will increase citraturia. Malate, a polycarboxylic anion like citrate, is a potential candidate for chelating Ca(+2) and for inducing systemic alkalinization. We undertook to investigate these possibilities.

Materials and Methods

Theoretical modeling of malic acid's effects on urinary Ca(+2) concentration and supersaturation (SS) of calcium salts was achieved using the speciation program JESS. Malic acid (1200mg/day) was ingested for 7 days by eight healthy subjects. Urines (24 hours) were collected at baseline and on day 7. They were analyzed for routine lithogenic components, including pH and citrate. Chemical speciation and SS were calculated in both urines.

Results

Modeling showed that complexation between calcium and malate at physiological concentrations of the latter would have no effect on SS. Administration of the supplement induced statistically significant increases in pH and citraturia. The calculated concentration of Ca(+2) and concomitant SS calcium oxalate (CaOx) decreased after supplementation, but these were not statistically significant. SS for the calcium phosphate salts hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate increased significantly as a consequence of the elevation in pH, but values for brushite and octacalcium phosphate did not change significantly.

Conclusions

We speculate that consumption of malic acid induced systemic alkalinization leading to reduced renal tubular reabsorption and metabolism of citrate, and an increase in excretion of the latter. The decrease in SS(CaOx) was caused by enhanced complexation of Ca(+2) by citrate. We conclude that malic acid supplementation may be useful for conservative treatment of calcium renal stone disease by virtue of its capacity to induce these effects.

### Reduction of ureteral stent encrustation by modulating the urine pH and inhibiting the crystal film with a new oral composition: a multicenter, placebo controlled, double blind, randomized clinical trial [^1d86c343]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The calcification phenomenon has relevant clinical consequences that may compromise stent removal. When indwelling time increases, encrustation prevalence increases proportionally and global encrustation can occur, leading to the use of endourological techniques, extracorporeal lithotripsy or open surgery to resolve these conditions. Although heavily encrusted stents clearly do pose significant problems, minor encrustations can also challenge the endourologist, particularly if occurring frequently and repetitively. Some publications indicate that the mere presence of a biofilm in the stent increase patient's discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which may increase inflammation, tissue damage and eventually affect stent removal. To this date, no oral treatment to prevent or decrease stent encrustation have been proposed.

The degree of stent encrustation was strikingly reduced in the experimental group treated with the oral composition, when considering each stent end separated or their sum, as well when adjusting the data for baseline urine pH, age, sex, previous implantation and indwelling duration. Particularly for those stents with a global encrustation value, the difference between the intervention group and placebo yielded a relative risk of 8.2 and this effect was enhanced by baseline pH level.

The microscopic study of the stents indicated that organic matter in the urine (macromolecules or cellular debris) is first deposited on the stent forming a layer (conditioning film) that is several micrometers thick (Fig. 2, encrustation definition 0(f)). The thickness and composition of the conditioning film depend on the urine composition of the patient.

For patients with non-lithogenic urine (no hypercalciuria, no hyperoxaluria, no hypocitraturia, and a urinary pH between 5.5 and 6.2) and no bacterial colonization of the urine, organic matter deposits can occur, and act as heterogeneous nucleants that support the growth of COM crystals over 2 to 3 months. This growth is very slow, forming only a thin layer (thickness of several micrometers) (Fig. 2). The underlying mechanism may be analogous to the formation of COM stones in renal cavities. If a patient has a high level of urinary calcium, then COD crystals may develop.

### Potassium citrate (Urocit-K) [^a5cd7e01]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

When Urocit®-K is given orally, the metabolism of absorbed citrate produces an alkaline load. The induced alkaline load in turn increases urinary pH and raises urinary citrate by augmenting citrate clearance without measurably altering ultrafilterable serum citrate. Thus, Urocit®-K therapy appears to increase urinary citrate principally by modifying the renal handling of citrate, rather than by increasing the filtered load of citrate. The increased filtered load of citrate may play some role, however, as in small comparisons of oral citrate and oral bicarbonate, citrate had a greater effect on urinary citrate.

In addition to raising urinary pH and citrate, Urocit®-K increases urinary potassium by approximately the amount contained in the medication. In some patients, Urocit®-K causes a transient reduction in urinary calcium.

The changes induced by Urocit®-K produce urine that is less conducive to the crystallization of stone-forming salts (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid). Increased citrate in the urine, by complexing with calcium, decreases calcium ion activity and thus the saturation of calcium oxalate. Citrate also inhibits the spontaneous nucleation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (brushite).

The increase in urinary pH also decreases calcium ion activity by increasing calcium complexation to dissociated anions. The rise in urinary pH also increases the ionization of uric acid to the more soluble urate ion.

### Effect of bicarbonate on net acid excretion, blood pressure, and metabolism in patients with and without CKD: the acid base compensation in CKD study [^e4a510cf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Patients with CKD are at elevated risk of metabolic acidosis due to impaired net acid excretion (NAE). Identifying early markers of acidosis may guide prevention in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study compared NAE in participants with and without CKD, as well as the NAE, blood pressure (BP), and metabolomic response to bicarbonate supplementation.

Study Design

Randomized order, cross-over study with controlled feeding.

Setting & Participants

Participants consisted of 8 patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-59mL/min/1.73m 2 or 60-70mL/min/1.73m 2 with albuminuria) and 6 patients without CKD. All participants had baseline serum bicarbonate concentrations between 20 and 28 mEq/L; they did not have diabetes mellitus and did not use alkali supplements at baseline.

Intervention

Participants were fed a fixed-acid-load diet with bicarbonate supplementation (7 days) and with sodium chloride control (7 days) in a randomized order, cross-over fashion.

Outcomes

Urine NAE, 24-hour ambulatory BP, and 24-hour urine and plasma metabolomic profiles were measured after each period.

Results

During the control period, mean NAE was 28.3 ± 10.2 mEq/d overall without differences across groups (P = 0.5). Urine pH, ammonium, and citrate were significantly lower in CKD than in non-CKD (P < 0.05 for each). Bicarbonate supplementation reduced NAE and urine ammonium in the CKD group, increased urine pH in both groups (but more in patients with CKD than in those without), and increased; urine citrate in the CKD group (P < 0.2 for interaction for each). Metabolomic analysis revealed several urine organic anions were increased with bicarbonate in CKD, including 3-indoleacetate, citrate/isocitrate, and glutarate. BP was not significantly changed.

Limitations

Small sample size and short feeding duration.

Conclusions

Compared to patients without CKD, those with CKD had lower acid excretion in the form of ammonium but also lower base excretion such as citrate and other organic anions, a potential compensation to preserve acid-base homeostasis. In CKD, acid excretion decreased further, but base excretion (eg, citrate) increased in response to alkali. Urine citrate should be evaluated as an early and responsive marker of impaired acid-base homeostasis.

### Torsemide [^538330ab]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The signs and symptoms of overdosage can be anticipated to include those of excessive pharmacologic effect: dehydration, hypovolemia, hypotension, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hemoconcentration. Treatment of overdosage should consist of fluid and electrolyte replacement.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of torsemide and its metabolites are not widely available.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of torsemide and its metabolites. Torsemide is not dialyzable, so hemodialysis will not accelerate elimination.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^601e5fd2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The major renal response to metabolic acidosis is increased NH4 + excretion. Therefore, a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function (glomerular filtration rate > 25 ml/min) represents an inadequate renal response and is characteristic for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

Subtypes of RTA were determined as follows:

RTA type I (distal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH ≥ 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + secretion in the distal tubule.

RTA type II (proximal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced HCO 3− reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

RTA type IV: hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and high plasma potassium (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + and K + excretion in the distal tubule.

Transient RTA was defined as RTA on a single study day, while persistent RTA was defined as RTA on two or more days.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients during the first week after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, defined as hyperchloremic acidosis (BE Chloride) ≤ −5 mmol/L), a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg, and a preserved renal function. Secondary outcome measures were to evaluate the risk factors for RTA.
