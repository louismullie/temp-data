## Question

Which tablets are used for urinary frequency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tablets are used for urinary frequency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "urinary frequency" here most likely reflects overactive bladder (OAB) and to rule out other causes. Then, I should verify guideline-backed first-line strategies and approved oral drug classes. Next, I will enumerate the specific tablet options with typical dosing and pivotal evidence. After that, I need to consider nocturia-specific therapy, safety in special populations, and practical switching or combination strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, evidence-based pathway and monitoring plan to anchor prescribing choices.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Urinary frequency is a core symptom of OAB, typically coexisting with urgency and sometimes urge incontinence; however, I should not jump to conclusions before excluding UTI, polyuria, or other metabolic and urologic causes because that would misdirect pharmacotherapy targeting detrusor overactivity rather than the true etiology [^113oFDdE]. I should double-check that in women with incontinence, pharmacotherapy is usually adjunctive to behavioral therapy, and in nocturia-predominant cases, a frequency-volume chart helps determine whether nocturnal polyuria is present before selecting a tablet such as desmopressin [^113jUrcc] [^117TL32d].

> Next, I should review first-line management. Hold on, let me verify the sequence: guidelines consistently recommend behavioral interventions first (fluid and caffeine management, bladder training, pelvic floor strategies), then oral pharmacotherapy with antimuscarinics or β3-agonists if symptoms persist, with shared decision-making around efficacy and adverse effects [^113gt1ZW]. I need to ensure I note that combination therapy can be considered if a single agent is inadequate and that nonpharmacologic measures remain valuable adjuncts throughout care [^113RMZBc] [^115gypj7].

> Now, I will examine the anticholinergic tablet options, since these remain a common first-line pharmacologic approach. Let me think through the agents and their practical doses to get this right: oxybutynin is available as controlled-release tablets once daily (for example, Ditropan XL), while tolterodine is available as immediate-release tablets twice daily or extended-release capsules once daily; solifenacin is a once-daily tablet; darifenacin is an extended-release tablet once daily; fesoterodine is an extended-release tablet once daily; and trospium is available as immediate-release tablets twice daily or extended-release capsules once daily, with the latter often chosen for convenience and potentially better tolerability in some patients [^111AMTJ7] [^114bmgUH] [^114UPEno] [^116a4kMu] [^115tG9bB] [^114jQpXX]. Wait, I should verify the efficacy signals: solifenacin reduced daily micturitions by about 2.3–2.7 versus 1.4 with placebo over 12 weeks, reinforcing that these agents meaningfully address frequency endpoints in RCTs [^114UPEno].

> Hold on, let's not jump past the class-level evidence and tolerability. I need to check that meta-analyses and large reviews consistently show antimuscarinics reduce micturitions and urgency but are limited by anticholinergic adverse effects, especially dry mouth and constipation, which drive discontinuation; this is why extended-release formulations are often preferred when available [^113oFDdE]. I should confirm the adverse event profile: dry mouth is commonly reported, around 30% in pooled analyses, with constipation and blurred vision also occurring, which supports proactive counseling and dose/formulation adjustments to sustain adherence [^116EHawP]. I will also double-check that tolterodine and trospium trials demonstrated improvements in frequency endpoints within weeks, which is useful for setting expectations and planning early follow-up [^111qcbTf] [^114jQpXX].

> Let me now consider the alternative pharmacological class, the β3-adrenergic agonists, which are appropriate when anticholinergics are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or undesired. I should confirm the tablet options and dosing: mirabegron is available as 25 mg and 50 mg once-daily tablets, and vibegron is a 75 mg once-daily tablet; both improve micturition frequency and urgency in 12-week RCTs, with vibegron also indicated for OAB symptoms in men on pharmacotherapy for BPH, which can be clinically relevant in mixed storage/voiding symptom profiles [^114UhwH8] [^111hv3XH] [^113oaxbr] [^1172iVib]. I should verify that guidelines explicitly position β3-agonists as alternatives to antimuscarinics and that combination therapy with solifenacin plus mirabegron is evidence-based for incomplete response on a single agent [^113gt1ZW] [^113RMZBc] [^115mRFEv].

> But wait, what if comparative efficacy matters for a specific patient goal like reducing daytime frequency as much as possible. I need to check head-to-head and network evidence suggesting overall similar efficacy across classes, with small differences that may not be clinically large, although solifenacin 10 mg may outperform mirabegron 50 mg on micturition frequency in some analyses; this nuance should be balanced against individual tolerability and cognitive risk considerations in older adults [^111WoHR1] [^115Sri8N]. Let me reconsider: when monotherapy is suboptimal, guidelines support switching within class or across classes and considering combination therapy, which aligns with pragmatic care pathways for OAB frequency [^117TY3iy] [^113RMZBc].

> I will now examine nocturnal frequency specifically, because nocturia often needs a different approach. For patients with nocturnal polyuria contributing to nighttime frequency, desmopressin orally disintegrating tablets can reduce nocturnal voids and extend the first sleep period; lower, sex-specific dosing (for example, 25 µg in women and 50–100 µg in men) mitigates hyponatremia risk, but I should confirm that serum sodium monitoring is part of safe prescribing, especially in older adults and those with comorbidities [^112RKz6W]. Let me double-check sex-specific data: women responded to 25 µg ODT with significant reductions in nocturnal voids and improved sleep and quality of life, reinforcing the dosing differentiation to enhance safety [^113daBSB].

> Safety and special populations need careful attention. I should confirm that long-term anticholinergic use in older adults, particularly older women, carries cognitive risk signals and that guidelines urge caution, early review, and minimization of anticholinergic burden; trospium, a quaternary amine, is often considered when CNS penetration is a concern, though I must be transparent that this is a risk-mitigation rationale rather than definitive cognitive outcomes data [^114HNEYG] [^116La7xp]. Hold on, I should verify class cautions: antimuscarinics warrant extreme caution in narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, and urinary retention, which should be screened before prescribing, while β3-agonists are generally better tolerated and can be prioritized in patients at higher anticholinergic risk, including those already on other anticholinergic medications that raise total burden [^1115Uu3s] [^112wwQks]. For men with concomitant BPH on pharmacotherapy, I need to remember that vibegron carries an explicit indication for OAB symptoms in that context, which can streamline decision-making [^1172iVib].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially considered whether duloxetine tablets belong here because they can affect voiding intervals, but I should correct that thinking. Duloxetine is used for stress-predominant incontinence and is not an OAB frequency drug; it is not an appropriate first-line tablet for urgency/frequency due to detrusor overactivity, so I should exclude it from the OAB frequency tablet list despite occasional secondary outcomes related to voiding intervals in trials [^112E9iM9].

> Next, I should review practical strategy and follow-up. Guidelines recommend choosing extended-release formulations when possible to improve tolerability, arranging early reassessment within weeks to judge efficacy and side effects, and if needed, increasing dose, switching to an alternative agent or class, or layering combination therapy (for example, solifenacin with mirabegron) based on shared decision-making and patient priorities for symptom relief versus adverse effects [^115Bgfyv]. I need to ensure I incorporate the recommendation for early review and structured follow-up after starting anticholinergics or β3-agonists, which facilitates timely adjustments and improves persistence in real-world care [^112U9XTG] [^113zcERc] [^117AHSHa].

> To synthesize the tablet options succinctly, let me double-check the approved oral choices for urinary frequency attributable to OAB. Anticholinergic tablets include oxybutynin controlled-release once daily, tolterodine immediate- or extended-release, solifenacin once daily, darifenacin extended-release once daily, fesoterodine extended-release once daily, and trospium immediate- or extended-release, each with RCT evidence reducing micturition frequency from baseline versus placebo, albeit with anticholinergic adverse effects that can limit adherence, particularly at higher doses or with immediate-release formulations [^111AMTJ7] [^114bmgUH] [^114UPEno] [^116a4kMu] [^115tG9bB] [^114jQpXX]. β3-agonist tablets include mirabegron 25–50 mg daily and vibegron 75 mg daily, both of which improve frequency endpoints and can be used as monotherapy or, in the case of mirabegron, as add-on to solifenacin when response is incomplete, broadening options for patients who do not tolerate or prefer to avoid anticholinergics [^116k3AFd] [^111hv3XH] [^113oaxbr] [^1172iVib] [^115uJFqT].

> Finally, I need to ensure the care pathway is practical and safe. Start with behavioral therapy and address fluids and bladder training; if frequency persists, choose a tablet guided by comorbidities and patient preference, favoring extended-release anticholinergics or a β3-agonist when cognitive or anticholinergic burden is a concern, and reassess within 4–12 weeks to escalate dose, switch class, or combine agents for added benefit if monotherapy is inadequate; for nocturia with nocturnal polyuria, consider desmopressin ODT with serum sodium monitoring and sex-specific dosing, especially in older adults [^113gt1ZW] [^113RMZBc] [^113zcERc] [^112RKz6W] [^113daBSB]. I should double-check at each step for contraindications and patient-specific risks, and document shared decisions given the small but meaningful differences in efficacy across options and the central role of tolerability in long-term persistence [^115Sri8N].

Urinary frequency tablets reduce urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence [^113oFDdE], with **antimuscarinics as first-line therapy** and **beta-3 agonists as alternatives** [^115mRFEv] [^116k3AFd]. Antimuscarinics (oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, trospium) are effective [^113oFDdE] but cause dry mouth, constipation, and **cognitive effects**, especially in older adults [^114HNEYG] [^113A3MGU]. Beta-3 agonists (mirabegron, vibegron) [^113gt1ZW] are similarly effective [^111WoHR1] with fewer anticholinergic side effects but **may raise blood pressure**. Desmopressin is used for nocturia [^112RKz6W] and requires sodium monitoring due to **hyponatremia risk** [^113daBSB]. Choice depends on patient factors, comorbidities, and tolerability [^113gt1ZW]; consider combination therapy when monotherapy is inadequate [^115uJFqT].

## Pharmacological classes and mechanisms of action

### Antimuscarinic agents

Antimuscarinics are the mainstay for OAB and urinary frequency [^114UhwH8], blocking muscarinic receptors and thereby reducing detrusor overactivity and urinary frequency [^117Vj8ji]. Antimuscarinics are **first-line** for OAB symptoms.

- **Oxybutynin**: Effective [^116MADFk] but high rates of dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive effects, especially in older adults [^114HNEYG] [^113oFDdE].

- **Tolterodine**: Similar efficacy to oxybutynin [^113oFDdE] with fewer anticholinergic side effects.

- **Solifenacin and darifenacin**: Greater selectivity for M3 receptors, potentially fewer cognitive effects but more constipation.

- **Fesoterodine**: Greater efficacy than tolterodine [^113cuMP6] but more dry mouth and constipation [^115tG9bB].

- **Trospium chloride**: Quaternary structure limits CNS penetration, potentially fewer cognitive effects [^116La7xp].

---

### Beta-3 adrenergic agonists

Beta-3 agonists relax the detrusor muscle during filling to reduce frequency and urgency; they are **alternatives** to antimuscarinics [^116k3AFd]. Mirabegron has efficacy similar to antimuscarinics [^111WoHR1] with fewer anticholinergic effects but may increase **blood pressure**, whereas **vibegron** offers similar efficacy to mirabegron with fewer cardiovascular effects.

---

### Desmopressin

Desmopressin, a vasopressin analog, reduces nocturnal urine production and is used for nocturia [^112RKz6W]; **monitor sodium** due to hyponatremia risk [^113daBSB].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists reduce micturitions, urgency, and incontinence episodes [^113oFDdE]; **efficacy is similar** between classes [^111WoHR1] [^115Sri8N].

| **Medication class** | **Reduction in micturitions/day** | **Reduction in urgency episodes/day** | **Reduction in incontinence episodes/day** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antimuscarinics | 1.5–2.5 | 1.0–2.0 | 0.5–1.5 |
| Beta-3 agonists | 1.5–2.0 | 1.0–1.5 | 0.5–1.0 |

---

Desmopressin **reduces nocturnal voids** by ~0.5–1.0 per night [^112RKz6W] [^113daBSB].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Antimuscarinics commonly cause dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive effects, especially in older adults; **use caution in older adults** [^114HNEYG] [^112wwQks] [^113A3MGU]. Beta-3 agonists have fewer anticholinergic effects [^1172iVib] but may increase blood pressure; **monitor BP**. Desmopressin can cause hyponatremia, especially in older adults; **monitor sodium** [^112RKz6W] [^113daBSB].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Use antimuscarinics cautiously in older adults due to cognitive risks; consider beta-3 agonists [^114HNEYG] [^112rMG9f].

- **Comorbidities**: Avoid antimuscarinics in narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or severe constipation; use beta-3 agonists cautiously in hypertension [^1115Uu3s].

- **Gender**: No significant differences in efficacy or safety between genders [^114UPEno] [^111hv3XH].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy (antimuscarinic plus beta-3 agonist) improves efficacy in refractory OAB but also increases side effects; **weigh benefits vs harms** [^113gt1ZW] [^115uJFqT].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Vibegron**: New beta-3 agonist with favorable safety profile [^115LyvQ8] [^1172iVib].

- **Botulinum toxin**: Effective for refractory OAB but requires intravesical injection [^116y7JaP].

- **Neuromodulation**: Noninvasive options under investigation [^111AfeaN].

---

Urinary frequency tablets include antimuscarinics, beta-3 agonists, and desmopressin; **choose based on patient factors** and tolerability, and consider combination therapy for refractory cases [^113RMZBc].

### Comparative efficacy and safety of medical treatments for the management of overactive bladder: A systematic literature review and mixed treatment comparison [^111WoHR1]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment guidelines recommend antimuscarinics as first-line pharmacologic therapy. Mirabegron is a first-in-class β3-adrenoceptor agonist licensed for the treatment of OAB and has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in treating OAB symptoms.

- **Objective**: To assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of OAB medications, specifically mirabegron 50 mg versus antimuscarinics in patients with OAB.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A systematic literature search was performed on published peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to 2013. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying changes in symptoms (micturition frequency, incontinence, and urgency urinary incontinence [UUI] episodes) and incidence of the most frequently reported adverse events (dry mouth, constipation) associated with OAB medications. The following drugs were considered in addition to mirabegron: darifenacin, tolterodine immediate release (IR) and extended release (ER), oxybutynin IR/ER, trospium, solifenacin, and fesoterodine. Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) were performed for efficacy (micturition, incontinence, UUI) and tolerability (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision).

- **Evidence synthesis**: Overall, 44 RCTs involving 27,309 patients were included. The MTCs showed that mirabegron 50 mg was as efficacious as antimuscarinics in reducing the frequency of micturition incontinence and UUI episodes, with the exception of solifenacin 10 mg, which was more efficacious than mirabegron 50 mg in improving micturition frequency and frequency of UU.

### Desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet effectively reduces nocturia: Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112RKz6W]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). High credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet versus placebo in patients with nocturia. Pharmacodynamics, safety, and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes were also evaluated. One of the several benefits of the new formulation is increased bioavailability, and exploring lower doses allows for a better evaluation of therapeutic effect versus tolerability.

This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind study comparing 10, 25, 50, or 100µg desmopressin versus placebo in adults with defined nocturia. The intent-to-treat population comprised 757 patients experiencing approximately three voids per night and a high prevalence of nocturnal polyuria (approximately 90%).

Increasing doses of desmopressin were associated with a decrease in the number of nocturnal voids and voided volume, a greater proportion of subjects with more than a 33% reduction in nocturnal voids, and an increased duration of the first sleep period. The lowest dose reaching statistical significance was 50µg, supporting lower and gender-specific dosing to reduce the small but clinically significant risk of hyponatraemia. Specifically, two men (aged 67 and 82) taking 100µg experienced hyponatraemia.

Each void reduced per hour of sleep gained was associated with significant improvements in quality of life.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115Sri8N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Cumulative evidence showed small differences across all comparisons of pharmacotherapies used to treat overactive bladder (OAB), including combination therapy (solifenacin/mirabegron) vs. monotherapy, with less than 0.8 episodes per day in difference. While some of these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance remains unclear. Importantly, all treatment groups reported more than one incontinence episode and 2.5 urgency episodes per day at the study's conclusion.

For patients with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) at baseline, fewer than 65% reported no incontinence over three days at the end of treatment. Anticholinergic adverse effects remain a concern, even with mirabegron. Given that persistence with antimuscarinic drugs is already known to be low, it is unclear whether the added benefit of combining mirabegron with solifenacin outweighs the increased harm. A patient's preference for increased efficacy versus reduced harms, as well as their tolerance of specific adverse events, should be considered when selecting treatment for OAB.

### Use of third line therapy for overactive bladder in a practice with multiple subspecialty providers-are we doing enough [^115oukiN]? The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder impacts more than 15% of the adult population. Compliance with medical treatment is low due to inadequate symptom control or intolerable side effects. Although third line therapies have improved the treatment of overactive bladder, many patients do not receive optimal treatment. We hypothesized that third line treatment use is higher among female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery urologists, and we examined its use at our tertiary referral center.

- **Materials and methods**: The electronic medical record was queried for patients with overactive bladder seen in 1 year. The number of visits associated with an overactive bladder prescription and the number of patients who received third line therapy were determined and subcategorized by department. Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers were considered separately.

- **Results**: A total of 5,445 patients (8,994 visits) were seen for overactive bladder. Of all patients seen for overactive bladder, 3.5% received third line therapy compared with 10.0% and 14.1% of those seen by urology providers and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The use of third line therapy was reported to be less than 5%. This rate is higher at our institution, which is likely due to multiple female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers. We also apply an algorithm that facilitates patient education on available options should first and second line treatments fail. Given the limited compliance with medical treatment for overactive bladder, we…

### Management of overactive bladder [^117Vj8ji]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Many people are affected by urinary urgency, which can be highly bothersome. Urgency is the cornerstone symptom of overactive bladder (OAB), commonly occurring in conjunction with urinary frequency and nocturia. Once other medical causes of similar symptoms have been excluded, first-line OAB management comprises fluid intake advice and bladder training, supplemented by antimuscarinic drugs if necessary. Urodynamic confirmation of the diagnosis is required for OAB patients whose symptoms are refractory to first-line interventions.

If patients are severely bothered by OAB despite optimization of medical treatment, they may proceed to invasive treatments, including neuromodulation, enterocystoplasty, detrusor myectomy, or urinary diversion. Our burgeoning understanding of the complex cellular, neural, and integrative physiology of the bladder offers new insights into the causative mechanisms of OAB, and reasons why patients sometimes fail to respond to treatment.

Study of sensory information pathways in the lower urinary tract has led to identification of the urothelium, afferent nerves, and interstitial cells as key cellular elements in OAB. In-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of central nervous system control is lacking, but functional imaging is beginning to elucidate the challenges that lie ahead. New treatments under investigation include botulinum neurotoxin-A injection, oral β(3)-adrenergic agonists, and novel modalities for nerve stimulation. The subjective nature of urinary urgency, the lack of animal models, and the multifactorial pathophysiology of OAB present significant challenges to effective management.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: Nuances and considerations [^112rMG9f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is characterized by a symptom complex that includes urinary urgency, frequency, and/or nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. While it is common in the general population, OAB disproportionately affects older adults, both in terms of prevalence and severity. Population‐based studies estimate that over a third of older adults suffer from OAB. The condition is also associated with significant psychosocial and health-related quality-of-life costs in the elderly, leading to increased social isolation, anxiety, depression, and risk of falls. Its economic burden is substantial as well; a 2010 analysis estimated a national cost of $83 billion by 2020, with over half of the costs associated with patients over age 65.

Updated 2019 guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction on the diagnosis and management of OAB provide a treatment algorithm based on progression from the least to the most invasive options. Behavioral therapies and lifestyle modifications form the foundation of treatment, with pharmacotherapy as the second‐line therapy and procedural interventions as third‐line options.

Pharmacotherapy for OAB, which includes anticholinergic and/or beta‐3 agonist medications, often presents challenges in elderly patients. Anticholinergics are known to have side effects such as constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, core temperature dysregulation, and cognitive impairment. Of particular concern in the elderly, recent studies have suggested a strong association between anticholinergic use and the risk of incident cognitive impairment.

### What is the best first choice oral drug therapy for OAB [^115AacvC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

The management of overactive bladder (OAB) involves lifestyle changes and conservative measures initially, with the use of liquid/dietary advice, weight loss, and bladder training. Thereafter, oral pharmacotherapy is implemented in symptomatic patients. Antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists form the main classes of drug therapy in this field. Views on what constitutes the best first-line OAB treatment are changing based on recent evidence and the adverse event profiles of these medications.

At the ICI-RS meeting 2023 in Bristol, UK, this topic was discussed and debated as a proposal. The following article summarizes the concepts presented on that day, as well as the interactive discussion that took place thereafter.

OAB guidelines are moving in many circumstances to either an antimuscarinic or beta-3 agonist approach based on patient factors. Several studies have raised concerns about the long-term impact of antimuscarinics regarding cognition, dementia, cardiovascular events, and mortality, all related to antimuscarinic load. Neither antimuscarinics nor beta-3 agonists have good persistence and adherence rates in the medium to long term. Several barriers also exist to prescribing, including guidelines recommending the use of drugs with the lowest acquisition cost and "step therapy". A newer approach to managing OAB is personalized therapy, considering the many possible etiological factors and phenotypes. These concepts are highlighted in this article.

Oral pharmacotherapy in managing OAB is limited by adverse events, adherence, and persistence.

### Which anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder symptoms in adults [^117BzDP3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Around 16% to 45% of adults experience overactive bladder symptoms, which include urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence, known as 'overactive bladder syndrome'. Anticholinergic drugs are a common treatment for these symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of different anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Incontinence Group's specialized trials register was searched on January 17, 2002, along with reference lists of relevant articles. A follow-up search for full publications of abstracts identified in January 2002 was completed in July 2003.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials involving adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality, and extracted data. Data processing followed the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials, comprising 39 parallel designs and 10 cross-over designs, were included in the review (11,332 adults in total). Most trials were described as double-blind, although they varied in other quality aspects. Crossover studies did not present data in a manner that could be included in the meta-analysis. Four trials collected quality of life data using validated measures; however, none reported usable data. In a comparison between oxybutynin and tolterodine, there were no statistically significant differences in patient-perceived improvement, leakage episodes, or voids in 24 hours. However, there were fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75), and less risk of discontinuation.

### Developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder [^112HxCeb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is a common and distressing condition that has a significant impact on the quality of life of many people worldwide. Anticholinergics remain the first line in pharmacotherapy; however, the use of these agents is hindered by adverse effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there is a need for more effective treatments. Recently, there has been a move towards targeting novel pathways thought to play a role in overactivity. This review aims to provide insight into the recent developments in pharmacotherapy for the overactive bladder.

Recent advances in our understanding of the basic science of the overactive bladder have made it clear that the control of bladder functioning is far more complex than previously believed. Peripherally, a prominent role has emerged for the urothelium and underlying suburothelium in mechanosensory control; the role of afferent pathways in pathophysiology is increasingly recognized.

Recent research has highlighted several potential targets for treating the overactive bladder, particularly within the mechanosensory pathways. With the exception of botulinum toxin, however, few new therapies have emerged showing clinical benefits. A clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of the bladder will hopefully lead to more effective and tolerated treatments.

### Enablex [^113ML9sW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Enablex® (darifenacin) extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder exhibiting symptoms of urgency, urge urinary incontinence, and increased urinary frequency in three randomized, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, 12-week studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), and one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-titration study (Study 4).

For study eligibility across all four studies, patients with symptoms of overactive bladder for at least six months were required to demonstrate at least eight micturitions and at least one episode of urinary urgency per day, and at least five episodes of urge urinary incontinence per week. The majority of patients were white (94%) and female (84%), with a mean age of 58 years, ranging from 19 to 93 years. Thirty-three percent of patients were over 65 years of age. These characteristics were well-balanced across treatment groups. The study population included both naïve patients who had not received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (60%) and those who had (40%).

- **Efficacy data**: The efficacy data was collected from 7- or 14-day voiding diaries in the three fixed-dose placebo-controlled studies involving 1,059 patients treated with placebo, 7.5 mg, or 15 mg once-daily Enablex for 12 weeks. A significant decrease in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in average weekly urge urinary incontinence episodes, was observed in all three studies. Data is also shown for two secondary endpoints: change from baseline in the average number of micturitions per day.

### Efficacy and safety of low dose desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet in women with nocturia: Results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study [^113daBSB]. The Journal of Urology (2013). High credibility.

Previous studies suggest that a lower dose of desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet may be effective in females compared to males with nocturia. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of a 25 μg desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet compared to placebo in female patients.

In this 3-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, 25 μg desmopressin taken once daily was compared to placebo in women with nocturia (2 or more nocturnal voids). The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline in the mean number of nocturnal voids and the proportion of patients achieving at least a 33% reduction from baseline in the mean number of nocturnal voids (33% responders).

The full analysis set comprised 261 patients, aged 19 to 87 years. Desmopressin significantly reduced the mean number of nocturnal voids and increased the odds of a 33% or greater response compared to placebo during the 3 months, as assessed by longitudinal analysis (-0.22, p = 0.028 and OR 1.85, p = 0.006, respectively). Desmopressin increased the mean time to the first nocturnal void by 49 minutes compared to placebo at 3 months (p = 0.003). The response to desmopressin was observed by week 1 of treatment and was sustained throughout the trial. Significant increases in health-related quality of life and sleep quality were also observed compared to placebo. Desmopressin was well tolerated. Serum sodium levels remained greater than 125 mmol/L throughout the trial, with only 3 transient decreases to less than 130 mmol/L recorded.

At a dose of 25 μg, desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet shows efficacy and safety in female patients with nocturia.

### Antimuscarinics for treatment of overactive bladder [^113sH6mJ]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

For many years, antimuscarinic drugs have been the first-line pharmacological treatment for urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence, all symptoms of the disorder termed overactive bladder. Antimuscarinic treatment is not always effective and is associated with side effects that limit its clinical use. The clinical significance of the effects of antimuscarinic drugs has been questioned lately. In this review, the rationale for the use of these drugs in the management of overactive bladder is re-examined, and the results of treatment are discussed. It is concluded that these drugs are the only treatment with undisputed effectiveness in the treatment of overactive bladder. They may not be the perfect treatment for all patients with this disorder, but their value for individual patients should not be underestimated. Further clinical trials with improvement in quality of life as the primary endpoint are needed and may give a fair reflection of the clinical value of antimuscarinic drugs.

### Gemtesa [^115LyvQ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Gemtesa was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled trial (Study 3003, NCT03492281) in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), which includes symptoms such as urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Patients were randomized in a 5:5:4 ratio to receive either Gemtesa 75 mg, a placebo, or an active control orally, once daily for 12 weeks. To qualify for study entry, patients needed to exhibit symptoms of OAB for at least 3 months, with an average of 8 or more micturitions per day and at least 1 urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episode per day, or an average of 8 or more micturitions per day along with an average of at least 3 urgency episodes per day. Urge urinary incontinence was defined as the leakage of urine of any amount due to the patient's immediate urge or need to urinate. The study population included both OAB medication-naïve patients and those who had received prior therapy with OAB medications.

The co-primary endpoints were the change from baseline in the average daily number of micturitions and the average daily number of UUI episodes at week 12. Additional endpoints included the change from baseline in the average daily number of "need to urinate immediately" (urgency) episodes and the average volume voided per micturition.

A total of 1,515 patients received at least one daily dose of either placebo (n = 540), Gemtesa 75 mg (n = 545), or an active control treatment (n = 430). The majority of patients were White (78%) and female (85%), with a mean age of 60 years (ranging from 18 to 93 years).

### Mixed urinary incontinence: Are there effective treatments [^112Kx7oy]? Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). High credibility.

Although standard treatments for urinary incontinence (UI) benefit some patients, a large unmet medical need remains. Emerging pharmacological treatments seem to offer better risk-benefit profiles than existing options, but they are still mainly targeting urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and overactive bladder. These emerging treatments actively exclude patients with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) from the development phase. While the development of safe and effective UUI treatments is a worthy endeavor, it does not address the unmet need of patients with MUI, for whom adequate treatment remains a challenge.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116CXRNF]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

This work was originally conducted for the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP), a collaboration of state Medicaid agencies that commission systematic reviews of drug therapies for use in policymaking. The scope of the original review was determined in consultation with DERP participants, and a protocol was developed a priori. The work presented here is an update of that work with the addition of the combination product. The systematic review was conducted according to the methods developed specifically for DERP and are in accordance with methods established by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) program.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies of adults with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), including urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) and mixed incontinence, were included. Studies of patients with only stress incontinence or neurogenic detrusor overactivity were excluded. We included the 2012 Cochrane Review of anticholinergic drugs as the baseline evidence and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the review that compared any formulation of darifenacin, fesoterodine, mirabegron, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium, and a combination of mirabegron with solifenacin, with each other. We only included study arms with doses approved by the FDA.

- **Search strategy and study selection**: To identify relevant citations, we searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in September 2018 using terms for included drugs.

### Duloxetine versus placebo for the treatment of women with stress predominant urinary incontinence in Taiwan: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112E9iM9]. BMC Urology (2008). High credibility.

In the secondary analyses, the median percent reduction in continence pad use was numerically, but not significantly, higher for the duloxetine-treated women compared with those on placebo (-0.67% vs. 0%, P = 0.14). In addition to decreasing their incontinence episode frequency (IEF), women in the duloxetine group also numerically increased their average voiding interval compared with those in the placebo group (11.85 minutes vs. 0.1 minutes, P = 0.13). There were improvements in mean I-QOL total and subscales scores for both the duloxetine- and placebo-treated groups, but separation between the groups was not statistically significant. The analysis of PGI-I showed that significantly more duloxetine-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects rated their condition as "very much better" and "much better".

### The effects of antimuscarinic treatments in overactive bladder: An update of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EHawP]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Antimuscarinic agents are currently the first-line pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. A systematic review published in 2005 was updated, including data on a newly licensed antimuscarinic (fesoterodine). The primary aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the efficacy of licensed administration of antimuscarinic treatments in overactive bladder from randomized controlled trials. Secondary aims were to review evidence on tolerability, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

All relevant data sources from randomized controlled trials were searched, and two independent reviewers considered publications for inclusion and extracted relevant data. Meta-analysis was used to pool efficacy, tolerability, safety, and HRQL outcomes by treatment. Efficacy was measured by continent days, mean voided volume, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency. Tolerability and safety were measured by means of adverse event and withdrawal rates. HRQL was measured by various instruments.

An additional 1118 references were retrieved, with data on 83 studies extracted. Antimuscarinics were found to be more effective than placebo. Tolerability was good; few of the antimuscarinics were found to have significantly higher withdrawal rates in comparison to placebo. No serious adverse event for any product was statistically significant compared to placebo. Dry mouth (mild, moderate, severe) was the most commonly reported adverse event (29.6% on treatment vs. 7.9% on placebo), followed by pruritus (15.4% on treatment).

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^117YUv2j]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Most subjects reported that their OAB symptoms caused a decrease in quality of life. The majority also reported that they had previously tried OAB treatments but had subsequently discontinued them, and that they would be interested in a patient-friendly approach to OAB therapy that delivered efficacy while overcoming drawbacks associated with currently available treatments.

After experiencing the sensation of stimulation, most subjects found transcutaneous stimulation comfortable; 95% of the subjects reported that they would be extremely or very likely to try a surgery-free, noninvasive stimulation system to treat their OAB. Given the high discontinuation rate of current treatment options, a nonsurgical, wearable neuromodulation system may provide a viable treatment alternative.

A long-term study with a system specifically designed for OAB patients is needed to determine the reliability of evoked EMG signals as a detection and control method, as well as usability, patient satisfaction, and efficacy.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of single-tablet combinations of solifenacin and tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system in men with storage and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms: results from the NEPTUNE study and NEPTUNE II open-label extension [^116gsjLj]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Short-term trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combination therapy using antimuscarinics and α-blockers in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The Study of Solifenacin Succinate and Tamsulosin Hydrochloride OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Males with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (NEPTUNE) II is the first long-term study using solifenacin (Soli) and the oral controlled absorption system formulation of tamsulosin (TOCAS).

- **Objective**: To evaluate long-term (up to 52 weeks) safety and efficacy of flexible dosing of two fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of Soli plus TOCAS in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Patients with both storage and voiding LUTS, maximum urinary flow rate of 4.0–12.0 ml/s, prostate size < 75 ml, and postvoid residuals ≤ 150 ml, who completed the 12-week, double-blind NEPTUNE study could continue in the 40-week, open-label NEPTUNE II study.

- **Intervention**: FDC of Soli 6 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg, or Soli 9 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg; patients could switch between doses in NEPTUNE II.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Safety and efficacy data from NEPTUNE and NEPTUNE II were combined to cover a 52-week period. Primary efficacy endpoints were total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and total urgency and frequency score (TUFS); secondary endpoints included IPSS storage and voiding subscores, micturition diary variables, and quality of life parameters.

- **Results**: In all, 1066 men completed NEPTUNE and received one dose or more of study medication.

### Detrol [^111qcbTf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Detrol tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received Detrol 2 mg twice daily, and 685 patients received a placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency, and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies.

- **Efficacy endpoints**:
	- The efficacy endpoints for study 007 included the change from baseline for:
	- Number of incontinence episodes per week
	- Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days)
	- Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days)

The efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010 were identical to the above endpoints, with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was measured per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

### Myrbetriq [^111hv3XH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Myrbetriq was evaluated in three 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials in patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Entry criteria required that patients had symptoms of overactive bladder for at least 3 months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 3 episodes of urgency with or without incontinence over a 3-day period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (94%) and female (72%) with a mean age of 59 years (range 18–95 years). The population included both naïve patients who had not received prior muscarinic antagonist pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (48%) and those who had received prior muscarinic antagonist pharmacotherapy for OAB (52%).

In Study 1 (NCT00689104), patients were randomized to placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, Myrbetriq 100 mg, or an active control once daily. In Study 2 (NCT00662909), patients were randomized to placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, or Myrbetriq 100 mg once daily. In Study 3 (NCT00912964), patients were randomized to placebo, Myrbetriq 25 mg, or Myrbetriq 50 mg once daily.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^115E9Uin]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment of urinary dysfunction

A total of one study was evaluated for the treatment of urinary dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), and one trial not meeting inclusion criteria was excluded. Solifenacin for the treatment of overactive bladder was evaluated in a high-quality, negative study. Although there were some significant benefits in the active arm, there is "insufficient evidence" to make a conclusion on efficacy. The practice implications for solifenacin for the treatment of overactive bladder are "possibly useful" as there were some significant benefits in this trial and because of the established efficacy and license of solifenacin in this indication outside PD. No safety concerns were reported. Systematic reviews reported typical peripheral antimuscarinic adverse effects in patients treated with solifenacin. Because of the data available in the geriatric population, solifenacin is considered to pose an "acceptable risk without specialized monitoring".

- **Treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED)**: A total of one study was evaluated for the treatment of ED in PD, fulfilling the inclusion criteria for review. Sildenafil was evaluated in one high-quality, positive study and is considered "efficacious" for the treatment of ED in PD, with the practice implication being "clinically useful". There is a lack of safety data for sildenafil in PD patients. Taking into account the data available in the general population, sildenafil is considered to pose an "acceptable risk".

### Myrbetriq [^115uJFqT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in Study 6 were:

- **Change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours**: This measurement was based on a 7-day micturition diary.
- **Change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours**: As with the first endpoint, this was also determined using the 7-day micturition diary.

An important secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean volume voided per micturition.

Results for the co-primary endpoints and mean volume voided per micturition for the overall patient population from Study 6 were initially considered for presentation but are listed in Table 14.

Figures 9 and 10 depict the co-primary endpoints, specifically the mean change from baseline (BL) over time in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, as well as the mean change from baseline over time in the number of micturitions per 24 hours in the overall patient population in Study 6.

- **Myrbetriq as add-on therapy to solifenacin succinate**: This combination was evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial in incontinent OAB patients who had received solifenacin succinate for 4 weeks and required additional relief for their OAB symptoms (Study 7). Entry criteria required that patients had symptoms of OAB for at least 3 months duration, including urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Additionally, they experienced at least 1 incontinence episode during a 3-day period after being treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg for 4 weeks. The majority of patients were Caucasian (94%) and female (83%) with a mean age of 57 years (range 18 to 89 years).

### Patient and physician decision-making dynamics in overactive bladder care: A mixed methods study [^114RGNvn]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder management includes multiple therapeutic options with comparable efficacy but a range of administration modalities and side effects, creating an ideal setting for shared decision-making. This study investigates patient and physician health beliefs surrounding decision-making and expectations for overactive bladder with the aim of better understanding and ultimately improving decision-making in overactive bladder care.

- **Methods**: Patient and physician participants completed a questionnaire followed by a semi-structured interview to assess health beliefs surrounding decision making and expectations for overactive bladder treatment. The semi-structured interview guide, developed in an iterative fashion by the authors, probed qualities of overactive bladder therapies patients and physicians valued, their process of treatment selection, and their experiences with therapies.

- **Results**: Patients (n = 20) frequently cited treatment invasiveness, efficacy, and safety as the most important qualities that influenced their decision when selecting overactive bladder therapy. Physicians (n = 12) frequently cited safety/contraindications, convenience, cost/insurance, and patient preference as the most important qualities. In our integration analysis, we identified four key themes associated with decision-making in overactive bladder care: frustration with inaccessibility of overactive bladder treatments, discordant perception of patient education, diverging acceptability of expected outcomes, and lack of insight into other parties' decisional priorities and control.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116rkbhj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We evaluated the results by examining the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies, exploring relationships in the data, and describing patterns across studies in the direction and magnitude of effects. Poor-quality studies were not synthesized with the rest of the evidence.

The applicability of the evidence was described using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting) framework. When outcomes were not reported as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio but provided sufficient data, we calculated these ratios. Meta-analysis was conducted when a sufficient number of studies investigated the same drug dose and were homogeneous enough to justify combining their results. We evaluated outcomes in terms of change from baseline rather than a comparison of endpoint scores as was done in the prior review. We imputed variance data where necessary.

Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effects using pairwise meta-analyses. The I² statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) was calculated to assess heterogeneity across studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined with subgroup analysis by factors such as study design, study quality, variations in interventions, and patient population characteristics. Meta-analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Where eight or more studies of a given intervention comparison and outcome were available, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### Pathophysiology of idiopathic overactive bladder and the success of treatment: A systematic review from ICI-RS 2013 [^113xSEPr]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of phenotype profiling in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome and to determine the effectiveness of treatment among individuals with different pathophysiologic profiles.

The methods involved searching electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL, from January 1, 1980, to August 12, 2013, for interventional randomized controlled treatment trials (RCTs) of idiopathic OAB. Phenotyping considered pathophysiologies originating in the urothelial/mucosal layer of the bladder, the detrusor muscle cell layer, and the central nervous system. Articles analyzing urgency outcomes based on pathophysiologic profiling were selected. Due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcome assessment measures, a meta-analysis was not appropriate; instead, a qualitative synthesis was undertaken.

The results indicated that out of 239 original RCTs of idiopathic OAB, 48 (20%) profiled participants based on underlying pathophysiology. Less than half of these (n = 20) reported treatment efficacy for urgency symptoms by pathophysiological sub-type. One study examined the effect of botulinum A toxin on interstitial cell protein expression. Four studies compared treatment efficacy in OAB patients with and without involuntary detrusor contractions. Fifteen studies compared the effect of treatment on urgency reduction in patients with detrusor overactivity. There were no consistent trends in treatment efficacy according to pathophysiologic sub-type. No studies examined urothelial dysfunction or abnormal central processing.

### Cranberry products and prevention of urinary tract infections [^115GDtHA]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Are cranberry products (juice, tablets, capsules, and syrup) associated with the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared with placebo or other treatments?

Cranberry products are not associated with the prevention of UTIs. However, the lack of association of cranberry products with a reduced incidence of UTIs in clinical trials may be due to a lack of participant adherence, insufficient active ingredients in the cranberry product, or insufficient statistical power.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^116La7xp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

However, dose adjustment, the combination of two different antimuscarinic drugs, and replacement by another antimuscarinic or a beta-3 agonist are options to improve treatment success in individual patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Selection of the best-tolerated drug is of great importance to avoid unnecessary side effects, especially in older patients. Co-medication can have its own anticholinergic effects and/or compete in metabolism in the cytochrome P450 system. Impairment of cognitive function as a side effect, and metabolic interactions, can largely be avoided by choosing an appropriate antimuscarinic such as the quaternary molecule trospium chloride, which does not seem to contribute to such effects and enables flexible dosing.

In patients where critical reassessment of diagnosis leads to an exclusion of underlying causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction and who do not respond to intensive first-line therapy, including adjusted antimuscarinic treatment, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, intravesical administration of onabotulinumtoxinA injections, or augmentation cystoplasty may be further treatment options.

### Non-medication coping strategies for urinary incontinence in older adults: Factors associated with frequency of use [^114hrvog]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of the use of non-medication coping strategies for urinary incontinence in older adults.

- **Methods**: This methodological and cross-sectional study was conducted with 320 older adults. Data were collected using a personal information form and a urinary incontinence questionnaire addressing the frequency of the use of non-medication coping strategies. For the validity and reliability study of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha, factor analysis tests, KMO, Bartlett's test, and principal components analysis were used. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, ANOVA, and correlation test were also employed for data analysis. The statistical accepted significance level was p < 0.05.

- **Results**: The mean age of the participants was 75.54 ± 9.34 years. Older adults who are illiterate, single, have a chronic disease, are at an advanced age, are women, describe having urinary incontinence during activities, always experience leaking urine, have their diapers or underwear wet, share these issues with their relatives, and do not consult a doctor due to fear of being examined were found to have a higher frequency of use of coping strategies for urinary incontinence (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: This study recommends carrying out initiatives to raise awareness about urinary incontinence in older adults. Additionally, it suggests that the questionnaire applied to older adults regarding the frequency of the use of coping strategies is valuable.

### Myrbetriq [^113oaxbr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in all three trials were (1) change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and (2) change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours, based on a 3-day micturition diary. An important secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in mean volume voided per micturition.

Results for the co-primary endpoints and mean volume voided per micturition from Studies 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Table 13.

MYRBETRIQ 25 mg was effective in treating the symptoms of OAB within 8 weeks and MYRBETRIQ 50 mg was effective in treating the symptoms of OAB within 4 weeks. Efficacy of both 25 mg and 50 mg doses of MYRBETRIQ was maintained through the 12-week treatment period.

Figures 3 through 8 show the co-primary endpoints, mean change from baseline (BL) over time in number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean change from baseline over time in number of micturitions per 24 hours, in Studies 1, 2, and 3.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^114VGbuP]. Neurourology and urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a stressful and disruptive disorder affecting millions of individuals and significantly decreasing their quality of life. OAB is characterized by urinary urgency, often accompanied by increased frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Urgency refers to a sudden, irresistible desire to pass urine. Frequency indicates more than seven voids per day, while nocturia involves more than one void per night. Urge incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine associated with a sudden, compelling desire to void. A diagnosis requires a combination of these symptoms without a pathologic or metabolic cause.

The national prevalence of OAB is estimated at 16.5%, but the actual number of affected individuals is likely much higher. Many people with OAB delay or avoid seeking medical attention due to embarrassment or lack of awareness about available treatments.

Patients are offered treatment according to guidelines from the American Urological Association.

- **First-line treatments**: Patients initially receive physical therapy and behavioral therapies, which are effective for some but often suffer from non-compliance.

- **Second-line treatments**: This includes medications such as anticholinergics and β-3 agonists, which show 70% to 80% improvement rates but can result in significant side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, and cognitive decline, in addition to being cost-prohibitive.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116Ue1jV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We abstracted information on baseline population characteristics, interventions, subject enrollment and discontinuation, and results for effectiveness and harms outcomes.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: Examined change from baseline number of incontinence and urgency (grade 3 or 4) episodes, micturition frequency, proportion of patients reporting no incontinence over three days at the end of the study, and patient-reported symptom assessment using the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Symptom Bother score, or the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). The PPBC contains six items assessing change scores from −2 to 2, with negative scores indicating improvement. A clinically meaningful difference has not yet been established for the PPBC. The OAB-q Symptom Bother score contains eight items on a 100-point scale, with a suggested minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of ten points. The OABSS consists of four questions, one each assessing daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urge urinary incontinence (UUI), with a maximum score of 2, 3, 5, and 5, respectively (higher scores indicate worse symptoms), yielding a total possible score of 15. An MCID of three points has been suggested.

- **Harm outcomes**: Examined withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined by individual studies, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, QT prolongation, arrhythmia, and other cardiac outcomes.

Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^113cuMP6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Fesoterodine 8 mg, which is chemically related to tolterodine, showed greater improvement in incontinence, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency than tolterodine 4 mg. However, fesoterodine appeared to have a worse safety profile with significantly higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE), constipation, and dry mouth than tolterodine.

Based on one small trial using the OABSS, no difference was found between fesoterodine 4 mg and solifenacin 5 mg. Patients who received fesoterodine reported a higher incidence of adverse events of interest, but none reached statistical significance, likely due to the small sample size. Solifenacin 5 mg reduced one-half incontinence and urgency episodes per day more than tolterodine 4 mg, a significant difference. Overall adverse event profiles are similar between solifenacin and tolterodine, except that solifenacin led to a significantly higher incidence of constipation than tolterodine. Both fesoterodine and solifenacin are more effective than tolterodine, but clinicians should consider solifenacin for its better safety profile than fesoterodine.

From the 2012 review, oxybutynin showed comparable improvement of incontinence and micturition frequency to solifenacin 5 mg and tolterodine. The 2012 review did not evaluate patients' assessment of symptoms, though the review found no difference between oxybutynin and tolterodine in terms of condition-specific quality of life. Significantly more patients randomized to oxybutynin withdrew because of adverse events than with solifenacin or tolterodine, likely attributable to its side effect profile.

### Ditropan XL [^116MADFk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Ditropan XL® (oxybutynin chloride) was evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder, characterized by symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. The research included three controlled studies and one open-label study. The majority of participants were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%), with a mean age of 59 years, ranging from 18 to 98 years.

Eligibility criteria required patients to have urge or mixed incontinence, with a predominance of urge, as evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 utilized a fixed-dose escalation design, while the other studies employed a dose-adjustment design, where each patient's final dose was adjusted to balance symptom improvement with side effect tolerability. Controlled studies comprised patients who were known to respond well to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks.

The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are detailed in the accompanying tables and figures.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111gSoAc]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

- **Symptom scores**: Figure 3 presents the symptom sum scores for dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain from days 0 to 7 by randomisation group (range 0–12, intention-to-treat population). Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the area under the curve (AUC) of symptom sum scores for the same symptoms over the same period, again by randomisation group (intention-to-treat population).

- **Secondary outcomes**: All secondary outcomes related to symptoms favored the fosfomycin group. On days 0–4, the total symptom burden, measured as the area under the curve, was significantly higher in the ibuprofen group compared to the fosfomycin group. The same results were evident when symptoms were considered individually: each symptom (dysuria, frequency/urgency, abdominal pain) showed a higher symptom burden on days 0–7 in the ibuprofen group.

	- With a mean duration of 5.6 days, symptoms persisted about a day longer in the ibuprofen group. On day four, 129 (56%) women in the fosfomycin group versus 91 (39%) in the ibuprofen group were symptom-free (P < 0.001). By day seven, these rates increased to 82% and 70%, respectively (P < 0.001).

	- Table 3 outlines the number and percentage of women without symptoms from day 1 to 7 in the intention-to-treat population with uncomplicated urinary tract infection, randomised to ibuprofen or fosfomycin.

	- **Impairment of activity**: Women in the ibuprofen group recorded slightly higher scores for impairment of activity, indicating more of their work or regular activities were affected by the urinary tract infection (Table 4, Figure 5).

### Vesicare [^114UPEno]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Vesicare was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients experiencing symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence, with a predominance of urge. Entry criteria required that patients exhibit symptoms of overactive bladder for a duration of three or more months. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1,811 on Vesicare and 1,216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies.

- **Study evaluations**: Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 mg and 10 mg Vesicare doses (Studies 1 and 2), while the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5), and 81% of the enrolled patients completed the additional 40-week treatment period.

The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years. The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in the number of micturitions per 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition.

The efficacy of Vesicare was similar across patient age groups and genders. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Vesicare 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Vesicare 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4).

### Urinary frequency as a possibly overlooked symptom in COVID-19 patients: Does SARS-CoV-2 cause viral cystitis [^1163QzT9]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a challenge for physicians triaging patients in emergency rooms. We identified a potentially dangerous overlap between classical urinary symptoms and the not yet fully described symptoms of COVID-19. Notably, following a patient was initially triaged as a urosepsis case and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, we focused on an increase in urinary frequency as a symptom of COVID-19. This symptom was identified in seven males out of 57 patients currently being treated in our COVID-19 wards. In the absence of other causes, urinary frequency may be secondary to viral cystitis due to underlying COVID-19 disease. We propose considering urinary frequency as an anamnestic tool in patients with infective symptoms to increase awareness among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus preventing the fatal implications of misinterpreting urological symptoms.

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for daytime urinary incontinence in children: Comparison of recommendations on treatment [^113yEe5d]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

The pharmacological treatment with anticholinergics was endorsed by all the guidelines in cases of overactive bladder (OAB), either if urotherapy alone was not sufficient, or as a first-line option alongside urotherapy. The guidelines did not specify in which cases to start anticholinergics simultaneously or subsequently. The New South Wales (NSW) guideline did not specify the timing of medication initiation relative to urotherapy. Except for the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF), all the guidelines recommended oxybutynin as the first-choice anticholinergic for children. AWMF recommended propiverin as the first choice and oxybutynin as the second. Newer anticholinergics, such as tolterodine and solifenacin, were mentioned and sometimes recommended, but their use was classified as off-label.

Mirabegron, a selective beta-3 agonist, was mentioned in two guidelines. The Southeast Asia (SEA) guideline stated that mirabegron is not approved for children, but studies suggest its potential use in this group. According to the SEA, mirabegron should only be prescribed by pediatricians or pediatric urologists with a special interest in daytime urinary incontinence (DUI). The AWMF guideline referenced studies on mirabegron in children but concluded that the data do not justify the use of this new, unapproved drug in children and adolescents.

Four guidelines recommended methylphenidate for giggle incontinence. Alpha blockers were mentioned only by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS), but as off-label use.

Botulinum toxin is recommended for refractory OAB by five guidelines, with the NVU/NVK and ICCS also recommending it for refractory dysfunctional voiding (DV). Except for the AWMF, they specified its use.

### Fesoterodine fumarate [^115tG9bB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for at least 6 months, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to receive a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day or 8 mg/day, or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm using an oral antimuscarinic agent. For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years).

- **Primary efficacy endpoints**: The mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours were assessed.

- **Secondary endpoint**: An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116mVciz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

- **Prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flow diagram**.

Table 1 shows characteristics of newly included studies. Considering fair- and good-quality RCTs identified in this update, trial sample sizes of included populations ranged from 60 to 3080. Trial durations ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with a median of 12 weeks. Of the 12 trials that reported funding sources, all but one were funded by industry. The mean age of patients was 57.4 years (SD 13.4), with a mean BMI of 28.4. Similar to RCTs included in the 2012 review, patients were predominantly female (77.7%) and White (89.7%). UUI was the most common form of OAB (58.6%), followed by mixed incontinence (22.2%) and then OAB without incontinence (19.4%). Patients experienced a mean of 67.4 months of OAB symptoms, and 59.2% had previous pharmacotherapy for OAB. At baseline, patients reported means of 3 incontinence episodes, 6.1 urgency episodes, and 2.5 UUI episodes per day. As with previously included RCTs, there was a wide range of baseline incontinence episodes per day (range 1.9 to 8.9 episodes per day, median 2.78). Baseline numbers of urgency and UUI episodes were more consistent, with a range of 4.2 to 8.2 urgency episodes and 1.7 to 3.9 UUI episodes per day.

### Trospium chloride [^114jQpXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2014). High credibility.

Trospium chloride extended-release capsules were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder who had symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and urge urinary incontinence in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For both studies, entry criteria required the presence of urge incontinence (predominance of urge), at least one incontinence episode per day, and 10 or more micturitions (voids) per day (assessed by a 3-day urinary diary). Medical history and data from the baseline urinary diary confirmed the diagnosis. Approximately 88% of the patients enrolled completed the 12-week studies. The mean age was 60 years, and the majority of patients were female (84%) and Caucasian (86%).

- **Co-primary endpoints**: The trials measured the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of voids per 24 hours (reductions in urinary frequency) and the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.
- **Secondary endpoints**: Included was the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in volume per void.

Study 1 included 592 patients in both the trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg and placebo groups. Trospium chloride extended-release capsules demonstrated statistically significantly (p < 0.01) greater reductions in urinary frequency and incontinence episodes, and increases in void volume when compared to placebo, beginning at Week 1 and maintained through Weeks 4 and 12.

Study 2 included 543 patients in both the trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg.

### Central nervous system findings on functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients before and after treatment with anticholinergic medication [^116hCSRi]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic medications are commonly used to treat urinary urgency and frequency. Muscarinic receptors are located in areas beyond the detrusor muscle. In this study, we measured changes in central nervous system activity in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tolterodine or a placebo.

A total of 20 female patients with urinary frequency were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with tolterodine or a placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, based on blood oxygenation level dependent imaging of the brain during bladder filling, was performed before and after treatment. For each patient, the bladder was filled by a urethral catheter and emptied 5 times.

Multiple brain areas showed significant activation with bladder filling compared to the empty state, and many areas also showed deactivation. Overall brain activation with bladder filling was decreased after treatment in both groups. After treatment, two areas of the parietal cortex (precuneus and postcentral gyrus) showed significantly greater activity in patients treated with tolterodine compared to placebo. Two areas of the cerebellum (anterior lobe and culmen) showed significantly greater activity in the placebo group, and these were also areas of significant deactivation in the tolterodine group.

Brain activity changes, as well as the areas of activation after treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with an anticholinergic medication or placebo, are different in the two groups. Whether this finding represents action at the central nervous system level remains to be further investigated.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^111AfeaN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of several efficacious treatments for OAB, treatment persistence remains extremely low due to the side effects, risks, and inconvenience of the current options. There is a compelling need for a treatment that is effective, economical, and adaptable to a patient's lifestyle. To assess the feasibility of such an approach, this study evaluated the comfort and tolerability of noninvasive neuromodulation in patients with OAB, as well as their interest in this treatment option.

### Treatment of overactive bladder: What is on the horizon [^116y7JaP]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is still a need to develop additional effective and well-tolerated therapies for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The purpose of this review is to discuss alternative therapies for idiopathic OAB that employ a unique mechanism of action or offer a novel application of an existing therapy. We performed a comprehensive literature review to identify alternative therapies and potential future treatments for idiopathic OAB.

Use of botulinum toxin for idiopathic OAB is on the rise, and FDA approval is likely to be granted in the future. New innovations in neuromodulation hold the promise of less invasive and more patient-controlled therapies. A number of novel medications, such as β-adrenoreceptor agonists, or medications with alternative indications, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have been identified as potential therapies for OAB. In addition, novel drug delivery systems, such as vaginal inserts, are also in development and may provide an attractive mechanism to deliver medications with proven efficacy.

While conservative measures such as behavioral modification and pelvic floor exercises remain first-line therapy for OAB, anti-muscarinics are the mainstay of medical treatment. For patients with idiopathic OAB refractory to traditional first-line therapies, a number of promising new treatments are on the horizon.
