## Question

Do you need longer term antibiotics for skull fractures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether longer-term antibiotics are needed for skull fractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts because skull fractures are heterogeneous, including basilar skull fractures with or without CSF leak, open/compound depressed skull fractures, and facial fractures. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews say about prophylactic antibiotics in each scenario. Next, I will examine the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials and meta-analyses, to see if longer courses reduce meningitis or surgical site infection. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stewardship-aligned recommendations and note any exceptions where a short course might be reasonable, anchoring to IDSA, ACS, and contemporary trauma society guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the answer depends on them. Basilar skull fractures with or without CSF leak are the classic scenario where prophylaxis has been debated, open or compound depressed skull fractures raise concern for direct contamination and dural breach, and facial fractures are anatomically related but generally follow different infection risks and surgical practices, so I should keep these separate as I appraise the evidence.

> Now, for basilar skull fractures with CSF leak, I need to check the highest authority. The IDSA 2017 guideline makes a strong recommendation against prophylactic antibiotics for basilar skull fractures with CSF leak, and it advises that if CSF leakage persists beyond 7 days, the leak should be repaired rather than extending antibiotics, which is a critical point I should not overlook [^115L8GEr] [^115L8GEr]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base behind that. The Cochrane meta-analysis of randomized trials found no reduction in meningitis, mortality, or need for surgical correction with prophylactic antibiotics in basilar skull fractures with or without CSF leak, reinforcing the IDSA stance and arguing against longer courses [^117HptDL] [^112Yhj3S]. I should also note that a randomized trial of ceftriaxone in traumatic pneumocephalus did not show benefit, which aligns with the broader signal that antibiotics don't prevent meningitis in this setting [^113EX9uo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any subgroup or observational signal contradicts this. A retrospective cohort of closed basilar skull fractures likewise found no association between prophylactic antibiotics and reduced meningitis risk, which supports the conclusion that longer-term prophylaxis is not beneficial in this population [^115cLXiu]. But wait, what if the leak persists? The guideline still recommends repair rather than prolonged antibiotics, so extending antibiotics beyond a week is not the correct strategy here [^115L8GEr].

> Next, I will examine open or compound depressed skull fractures, where contamination and dural violation are the main concerns. The ACS guidance recommends broad-spectrum antibiotics with good CNS penetration for a maximum of 3 days in open skull fractures, with surgical debridement and irrigation as the cornerstone, and it explicitly advises against prophylaxis for basilar skull fractures with CSF leak or pneumocephalus, which I should emphasize to avoid conflating scenarios [^112v3raz]. Let me verify pediatric data; a multicenter pediatric study of open calvarial fractures reported low infection rates and no association between antibiotic duration and infection, supporting the principle that prolonged prophylaxis is unnecessary when wounds are managed appropriately [^111Bj1DW]. I should confirm that this aligns with neurosurgical practice; operative management with early debridement is standard to mitigate infection risk, again placing the emphasis on surgery rather than extended antibiotics [^113dWS6h].

> For facial fractures, I need to ensure I separate operative from nonoperative management. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same message: routine postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours do not reduce infections in facial fractures, and several studies show no benefit of extending prophylaxis beyond 24 hours, with some even associating longer courses with more complications, so I should be cautious not to overextend therapy here [^111HiN4S] [^116s4NwE] [^111Ujxm8]. Let me verify nonoperative data; a prospective multicenter AAST study found no reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics in nonoperative facial fractures, and infection rates were very low overall, arguing against antibiotics altogether in that group [^111x2y1y]. I should also confirm consensus statements; the AAST critical care consensus recommends no postoperative antibiotics for closed, non-contaminated operative facial fractures and no antibiotics for nonoperative facial fractures, which aligns with stewardship principles [^112jn3hu] [^115WTJzN].

> But wait, what if there is severe contamination or a through-and-through laceration communicating with the oral cavity; do we need longer courses then? Even in higher-risk soft tissue scenarios, the balance of evidence favors short-course prophylaxis when indicated, typically 24 hours or less, rather than 7–10 days, and decisions should be individualized to wound and patient factors rather than defaulting to prolonged therapy [^111gDDZz] [^111xWvWD]. I should double-check that this is consistent with facial trauma algorithms; contemporary reviews emphasize short perioperative prophylaxis and highlight the lack of benefit from extended regimens, reinforcing restraint [^112jn3hu].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing any exceptions. Across basilar skull fractures with CSF leak, open/compound depressed skull fractures, and facial fractures, the highest-quality evidence and guidelines consistently show that longer-term antibiotic prophylaxis does not improve outcomes and may increase harm through adverse effects and resistance; therefore, antibiotics should be short when used at all, typically no more than 24–72 hours depending on the scenario, with the emphasis on surgical management, timely debridement, and leak repair when indicated [^1148kExR] [^112v3raz] [^111HiN4S]. I should confirm that this aligns with stewardship frameworks; narrative reviews identify prolonged prophylaxis as a target for antimicrobial stewardship, which supports avoiding longer courses in the absence of proven benefit [^1148Gx5x].

> Final answer: No, longer-term antibiotics are not needed for skull fractures. Prophylactic antibiotics, when indicated, should be limited to short courses, generally 24 hours or less for most facial fractures and no more than 3 days for open/compound depressed skull fractures, while basilar skull fractures with CSF leak should not receive prophylactic antibiotics at all and persistent leaks should be repaired rather than treated with extended antibiotics [^1148kExR] [^112v3raz] [^111HiN4S].

---

In general, **longer-term antibiotics are not needed for skull fractures** [^1148kExR]. For basilar skull fractures with CSF leak, prophylactic antibiotics are **not recommended** because they do not reduce meningitis risk [^117HptDL]; if a leak persists beyond 7 days, surgical repair is advised [^115L8GEr]. For open (compound) depressed skull fractures, give broad-spectrum antibiotics with CNS penetration for a maximum of 3 days [^112v3raz], with surgical debridement and repair as definitive care [^113dWS6h]. Routine prolonged antibiotics are not indicated for closed or non-depressed fractures without CSF leak [^112v3raz]. Prolonged therapy increases adverse effects and resistance without proven benefit, so antibiotics should be limited to the shortest effective course [^116s4NwE].

---

## Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in skull fractures

Antibiotic prophylaxis is **not universally indicated** for all skull fractures; its use depends on the fracture type, presence of CSF leak, and contamination:

| **Fracture type** | **Indication for antibiotics** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Basilar skull fracture with CSF leak | Not recommended [^1148kExR] | None [^115L8GEr] |
| Open (compound) depressed skull fracture | Recommended [^112v3raz] | ≤ 3 days [^112v3raz] |
| Closed, non-depressed skull fracture | Not recommended [^notfound] | None [^notfound] |
| Penetrating head injury | Recommended [^114jKV44] | 24 hours [^114jKV44] |

---

## Evidence against prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis

Several high-quality studies and guidelines show that **prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce infection risk** in skull fractures:

- **Basilar skull fractures**: The Cochrane review found no significant reduction in meningitis, mortality, or need for surgical correction with prophylactic antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures, with or without CSF leak [^117HptDL] [^112Yhj3S].
- **Open depressed skull fractures**: The ACS recommends broad-spectrum antibiotics for a maximum of 3 days, emphasizing surgical debridement and repair as definitive care [^112v3raz].
- **Closed fractures**: No evidence supports routine antibiotic prophylaxis for closed skull fractures without CSF leak [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged antibiotic use

Prolonged antibiotic therapy carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Increased antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged use promotes resistance, complicating future infections [^117HptDL].
- **Adverse effects**: Higher risk of gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, and Clostridioides difficile infection [^116s4NwE].
- **Increased healthcare costs**: Longer courses increase costs without added benefit [^111HiN4S].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines consistently advise against prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis for skull fractures:

- **IDSA guidelines**: Strongly recommend against prophylactic antibiotics for basilar skull fractures with CSF leak; if leakage persists beyond 7 days, surgical repair is recommended [^1148kExR] [^115L8GEr].
- **ACS guidelines**: Recommend antibiotics for open depressed skull fractures for a maximum of 3 days, with surgical management as definitive care [^112v3raz].
- **AAST consensus**: Recommends 24 hours of prophylactic antibiotics for penetrating head injuries, not extended courses [^114jKV44].

---

## Special considerations

Certain scenarios may warrant **individualized decisions**:

- **Persistent CSF leak**: If a CSF leak persists beyond 7 days, surgical repair is recommended rather than prolonged antibiotics [^1148kExR] [^115L8GEr].
- **Severe contamination**: In cases of gross contamination or extensive soft tissue injury, a short course of antibiotics (≤ 3 days) may be considered, but definitive surgical management remains essential [^112v3raz].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Immunocompromised patients or those with multiple comorbidities may require individualized assessment, but prolonged prophylaxis is still not routinely recommended [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for skull fractures. Antibiotics should be limited to the shortest effective course, typically ≤ 3 days for open depressed fractures, and avoided in basilar skull fractures with CSF leak [^1148kExR]. Surgical management, including debridement and repair, is the cornerstone of infection prevention. Prolonged antibiotics increase risks and costs without proven benefit, so stewardship and guideline-concordant care are essential [^1148Gx5x].

Face and scalp

The evidence for prophylactic antibiotic use for traumatic injuries of the face is heterogeneous and of fairly low quality, and there are no sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials on this topic. As a result, there is tremendous variability in practice patterns among treating surgeons, and many providers continue antibiotic prophylaxis longer than proposed, which leads to overuse of antibiotics in this patient population.

The Surgical Infection Society (SIS) recently published a guideline for prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with traumatic facial fractures. The authors of the SIS guidelines defined prophylactic antibiotics as antibiotics administered for more than 24 hours. This was further broken down into preoperative antibiotics (administered more than 1 hour before surgery or 2 hours if receiving vancomycin or quinolones), perioperative antibiotics (administered within 1 hour of surgery, but no more than 24 hours after surgery), and postoperative antibiotics (continued beyond 24 hours after surgery). We use these definitions for the recommendations outlined in this clinical consensus document.

World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

An evidence‐based consensus statement from the Neurocritical Care Society conditionally recommends one dose of antimicrobials prior to EVD insertion and strongly recommends against the continuous use of antimicrobials during placement. However, a recent retrospective cohort study did not demonstrate the benefit of AP in patients with EVDs or ICP monitors. Given that the quality of the studies published to date on AP for skull fractures and EVD or ICP monitor insertion is insufficient, the effectiveness of AP in these populations cannot be determined and requires appropriately designed RCTs.

For other truncal trauma the recommendations follow that of clean contaminated surgery, namely that in general, no prophylaxis should be given to blunt trauma patients unless a hollow viscus injury is suspected or identified. Antibiotic prophylaxis for penetrating trauma should not last more than 24 h in the absence of hollow viscus injuries and broad‐spectrum antibiotics with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria coverage are preferred while aminoglycosides should be avoided. In the case of hemorrhagic shock and associated acute kidney injury, the dose of antibiotics should be adjusted with a second dose if more than 4–6 units of blood are required. With abdominal pathology, the presence of contamination, underlying physiology, and core temperature also impact the risk of SSI. For limb trauma, open fractures benefit from prophylaxis for no more than 24 h while prolonged prophylaxis is traditionally used in maxillo‐facial trauma. Tetanus toxoid where appropriate and antiviral vaccines (e.g. rabies) should be used prophylactically if indicated. Where antibiotic therapy is given shortened (4–5 days) courses are preferred over longer (7–10 days) courses and are terminated early.

Antibiotic prophylaxis and duration: There is high quality evidence and numerous consensus guidelines to support perioperative prophylactic antibiotic therapy for maximally 24 h with appropriate re‐dosing for extensive blood loss (4–6 units) and prolonged surgery (> 4 h). There is low evidence to extend antibiotic prophylaxis after 24 h in trauma and this should be considered on an individual basis and whether there is cavity contamination, giving short‐course therapy in preference to long‐course prophylaxis.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112v3raz]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic skull fractures and perioperative prophylaxis — avoid the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for traumatic skull-based fractures with CSF leaks or pneumocephalus; in patients with open or penetrating skull fractures, consider treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics with high blood-brain barrier penetration for a maximum of 3 days. Surgical debridement and irrigation are recommended as the standard of care, with perioperative antibiotics for not more than 24 hours. For surgical prophylaxis, cefazolin is the drug of choice for patients without methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus unless the patient has a documented severe beta lactam allergy, with clindamycin or vancomycin as appropriate alternatives for those with a severe allergy to beta lactams; clarify any antibiotic allergy preoperatively and select the antimicrobial agent and dosing using published guidelines with pharmacist consultation.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in trauma patients with non-operative facial fractures: a prospective AAST multicenter trial [^111x2y1y]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Craniofacial trauma affects approximately 3 million individuals in the United States annually. Historically, low overall data quality and inadequate sample size have limited the development of clinical practice guidelines for prophylactic antibiotic use in facial fractures. We sought to examine the current use patterns and effects of prophylactic antibiotics in non-operative facial fractures.

Methods

A prospective analysis of adult patients with nonoperative facial fractures was conducted across 19 centers from January 2022 to December 2023. Kruskal-Wallis H, Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's χ², Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between antibiotic duration (no antibiotics, ≤ 24 hours, and > 24 hours) and facial fracture-associated infectious complications.

Results

Among 1,835 patients, 1,168 (63.7%) received no antibiotics and 667 (36.4%) received antibiotics (≤ 24 hours, n = 264 (14.4%); > 24 hours, n = 403 (22.0%). Nineteen (1.0%) patients developed infectious complications (0.7% in the no antibiotic group vs. 1.7% with antibiotics). Most patients (99.0%) did not develop an infection despite the majority (63.7%) receiving no antibiotics. Injuries were predominately closed fractures (86.3%), without mucosal disruption (83.9%) or foreign bodies (97.7%). Antibiotic administration had a statistically significant association with the occurrence of infectious complications (p = 0.050). However, no significant association was seen between antibiotic duration and infectious complications following multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders (≤ 24 hours: adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–5.14; p = 0.766; > 24 hours: adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–4.69; p = 0.668).

Conclusion

Despite most patients not receiving antibiotics, infection rates remained low. This indicates prophylactic antibiotic use does not reduce the risk of fracture-associated infections for most injury patterns. While a randomized trial is optimal to validate these data, at this time, there is no evidence to support presumptive antibiotics for closed non-operative facial fractures.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic/Care Management; Level II.

### Post-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid leakage [^116adt6H]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage frequently complicates skull base fractures. While most CSF leaks will cease without treatment, patients with persistent CSF leaks may be at increased risk for meningitis, and many will require surgical intervention. We reviewed the medical records of 51 patients treated between 1984 and 1998, with CSF leaks that persisted for 24 hours or longer after head trauma. Twenty-eight patients (53%) had spontaneous resolution of the leakage at an average of 5 days. Twenty-three patients (47%) required surgery. Eight patients (16%) had occult leaks presenting with recurrent meningitis at an average of 6.5 years posttrauma. Forty-three (84%) patients with CSF leaks had an associated skull fracture, most commonly involving the frontal sinus, while only 18 patients (35%) had parenchymal brain injury or extra-axial hematoma. Eight patients (16%) had delayed leaks at an average of 13 days posttrauma. Among patients with clinically evident CSF leakage the frequency of meningitis was 10% with antibiotic prophylaxis, and 21% without antibiotic prophylaxis. Thus, prophylactic antibiotic administration halved risk of meningitis. A variety of surgical approaches was used, with minimal morbidity. Three of 23 surgically treated patients (13%) required additional surgery for continued leakage. Patients with CSF leaks that persist greater than 24 hours are at risk for meningitis, and many will require surgical intervention. Prophylactic antibiotics may be effective and should be considered in this group of patients. Patients with skull fractures involving the skull base or frontal sinus should be followed for delayed leakage. Surgical outcome is excellent.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^112EUoMn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and basilar skull fracture — reported risks and management include that the overall infection rate of meningitis has been reported to be 1.4%, but in those who have depressed cranial fractures (up to 6% of patients with head injuries) the infection rate is as high as 10.6%; in a review of 51 patients with post-traumatic CSF leaks that did not resolve in 24 hours, the risk of meningitis was decreased from 21% to 10% with the use of prophylactic agents; however, in another study of patients with traumatic pneumocephalus, the administration of ceftriaxone did not appear to decrease the risk of bacterial meningitis; a Cochrane systematic review evaluated 208 participants from 4 randomized studies who were considered to have basilar skull fractures with meningitis and found there were no differences among the antibiotic and no-treatment or placebo groups and control groups in terms of reduction of the frequency of meningitis, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality, and the need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage; leakage of CSF is the major risk factor for the development of meningitis, most leaks resolve spontaneously within 3–7 days, but surgical intervention is indicated if leakage persists.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures [^112Yhj3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Basilar skull fractures (BSF) predispose patients to meningitis because of the possible direct contact of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx or middle ear with the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has been associated with a greater risk of contracting meningitis. Antibiotics are often given prophylactically, although their role for preventing bacterial meningitis is not established.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing meningitis in patients with BSF.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2005), EMBASE (1974 to June 2005), and LILACS (1982 to September 2005). We also performed an electronic search of meeting proceedings from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (1997 to September 2005) and handsearched the abstracts of meeting proceedings of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (1995, 1999 and 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic versus placebo or no intervention. We also identified non-RCTs to perform a separate meta-analysis to compare results.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently appraised the quality and extracted the data of each trial.

Main Results

Five RCTs and 17 non-RCTs comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention in patients with BSF were identified. Most trials presented insufficient methodological detail. All studies included meningitis in their primary outcome. Overall, we evaluated 208 participants from the four RCTs that were considered suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of the frequency of meningitis, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality, and need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage. We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the primary outcome in patients with and without CSF leakage. We also completed a meta-analysis of all the identified controlled non-RCTs (enrolling a total of 2168 patients), producing results consistent with the randomised data.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs does not support prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with BSF, whether there is evidence of CSF leakage or not. Until more research is completed, the effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with BSF cannot be determined because studies published to date are flawed by biases. Large, appropriately designed RCTs are needed.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures [^117HptDL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Basilar skull fractures predispose patients to meningitis because of the possible direct contact of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx or middle ear with the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has been associated with a greater risk of contracting meningitis. Antibiotics are often given prophylactically, although their role in preventing bacterial meningitis has not been established.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to June week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to June 2014) and LILACS (1982 to June 2014). We also performed an electronic search of meeting proceedings from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (1997 to September 2005) and handsearched the abstracts of meeting proceedings of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (1995, 1999 and 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic versus placebo or no intervention. We also identified non-RCTs to perform a separate meta-analysis in order to compare results.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification with trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

In this update we did not identify any new trials for inclusion. We included five RCTs with 208 participants in the review and meta-analysis. We also identified 17 non-RCTs comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention in patients with basilar skull fractures. Most trials presented insufficient methodological detail. All studies included meningitis in their primary outcome. When we evaluated the five included RCTs, there were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of the frequency of meningitis, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality and need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage. There were no reported adverse effects of antibiotic administration, although one of the five RCTs reported an induced change in the posterior nasopharyngeal flora towards potentially more pathogenic organisms resistant to the antibiotic regimen used in prophylaxis. We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the primary outcome in patients with and without CSF leakage. We also completed a meta-analysis of all the identified controlled non-RCTs (enrolling a total of 2168 patients), which produced results consistent with the randomised data from the included studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of trials as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs does not support prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with basilar skull fractures, whether there is evidence of CSF leakage or not. Until more research is available, the effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures cannot be determined because studies published to date are flawed by biases. Large, appropriately designed RCTs are needed.

Closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures?

Recommendations: Non-contaminated, operative facial fractures do not require postoperative antibiotics.

Discussion: Fractures of the upper one-third of the face (including fractures of the frontal sinus that do not involve the posterior table), middle one-third of the face (including LeFort fractures, zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, orbital fractures, maxillary sinus wall, and nasal bone fractures), and lower one-third of the face (non-dentate segments of the mandible) are considered non-contaminated fractures and have a lower frequency of postoperative infections. Therefore, continuing prophylactic antibiotics beyond 24 hours after surgical fixation is not recommended without documented infection. This is based on findings from multiple studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures that found no significant difference in infection rates between patients who received preoperative or postoperative antibiotics versus those who did not. In fact, one study concluded that a single dose of antibiotics at the time of induction (20 minutes before surgery) is sufficient. Soong et al conducted a non-blinded randomized study comparing 1 versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotic use after zygomatic or LeFort fracture repair and found no difference in infection rate between groups. The two more recent systematic reviews, one including 13 studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures, and the other mandibular fractures only, also found insufficient evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours. In fact, the use of antibiotics for > 24 hours postoperatively is more costly and may lead to more antibiotic-associated complications.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in closed basilar skull fractures: a nationwide cohort study [^115cLXiu]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing meningitis in patients with closed basilar skull fractures remains controversial. This nationwide cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between prophylactic antibiotic use and the incidence of meningitis in patients with closed basilar skull fractures using Korean national claims data.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with basilar skull fractures between 2002 and 2019 using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code S021. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service sample cohort database in South Korea. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of meningitis following closed basilar skull fractures, and those with open fractures or those who underwent surgery during hospitalization were excluded.

Results

Of the 1,173 patients included, 537 (45.8%) received prophylactic antibiotics and 636 (54.2%) did not. Patients who received antibiotics were significantly older and had higher rates of intensive care unit admission. Antibiotic use was more common in the elderly group (65 years or older) compared with pediatric (younger than 18 years) and adult (18–64 years) groups. Among those who received antibiotics, 15 cases of meningitis (2.6%) were reported, with no clear association between the type or duration of antibiotic and meningitis occurrence. The cumulative incidence of meningitis was extremely low in both groups, and there was no statistically significant difference in meningitis risk between the antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups across all observation periods. Adjusted hazard ratios indicated no significant association between antibiotic use and meningitis risk, and this finding was consistent in subgroup analyses by age.

Conclusion

This study found no significant association between prophylactic antibiotic use and reduced risk of meningitis in patients with closed basilar skull fractures. These findings suggest that routine prophylactic antibiotic administration may not provide additional benefits in preventing meningitis.

Non-operative facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of non-operative facial fractures?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should not be administered for closed, non-operative orbital, upper face, mid-face, or mandibular fractures.

Discussion: The SIS recommends against the use of prophylactic antibiotics for non-operative facial fractures based on the results of two small retrospective studiesand one small single-center randomized study. The study by Malekpour et al compared no antibiotics to a short course (1–5 days) or a long course (> 5 days) of antibiotics on the incidence of facial soft tissue infection or Clostridium difficile colitis. There were no soft tissue infections in any group. Mandibular and open fractures were excluded, limiting extrapolation to these groups. The study by Zosa et al included 403 patients and compared a short course (single dose or no antibiotics) to extended course (> 24 hours) and found no difference in infection rate between treatment groups (3% vs. 5%).

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for fractures of the facial skeleton remains uncertain, particularly regarding the balance between efficacy and safety.

Purpose

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and appropriate duration of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AM-C) prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical intervention of facial fractures.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted through December 2024. The search included terms such as "maxillofacial injuries" AND "amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate combination" and was limited to human studies and full-text publications.

Study Selection

Eligible studies assessed AM-C use, duration, and safety in surgically managed facial fractures. Included designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective studies, and retrospective cohorts. Studies lacking details on antibiotic regimen, duration, or outcomes were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including infection rates, adverse events, and definitions of therapy duration. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and ROBINS-I framework. Meta-analysis of RCTs was performed using a common effect model, with P values < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Efficacy was defined by perioperative infection rates; safety by incidence of antibiotic-related adverse events.

Results

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 270 patients from 4 RCTs and a total of 3,115 patients. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in infection rates between short (≤ 24 hours) and long (> 24 hours) perioperative AM-C regimens (odds ratio = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.84; P = 0.783). Adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and Clostridium difficile infection, were more common with prolonged therapy but did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.62; P = 0.867). Observational studies supported these findings.

Conclusion and Relevance

Short-duration AM-C perioperative prophylaxis appears sufficient for preventing infections in facial fracture surgery, with fewer adverse effects and reduced antibiotic exposure, supporting antimicrobial stewardship principles.

Open or contaminated facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of open or contaminated facial fractures?

Recommendations: Fractures of the frontal sinus that involve the posterior table, contaminated fractures, and open mandible fractures should receive 24 hours or less of antibiotics (table 2).

Discussion: Fractures that communicate with the oral cavity or dentate segment of the mandible (ie, angle, body, parasymphysis, and symphysis regions) are often considered open, contaminated wounds, and therefore may place patients at higher risk for osteomyelitis and other infectious complications. Some studies have reported infection rates as high as 50% for open fractures in the absence of antimicrobial prophylaxis. This has led to frequent utilization of antibiotic prophylaxis for these fracture patterns, especially among patients at high risk for infection-related complications (ie, immunosuppression), despite limited data to support this practice. Three small retrospective studiesand one single-center randomized study, including patients with mandibular fractures, found that preoperative antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in infection or non-union rates. It is important to note that these studies were all limited by study design, lack of a control group, and inadequate reporting of open fractures.

Two randomized studies of facial fractures limited postoperative antibiotic administration to less than 24 hours which resulted in a significant reduction in infections compared with patients who received no antibiotics. This may justify the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis until 24 hours after injury; however, continuation beyond this period is not recommended. In a review of antibiotic prophylaxis in facial trauma by Goormans et al, none of the included studies found a statistically significant benefit of prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis beyond 24 hours. In fact, some studies noted a significantly increased infection rate for patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis for more than 1 day. In terms of the recommended antibiotic type, no studies have compared the effect of different types of antibiotics on infection rates so the most suitable antibiotic for maxillofacial trauma is unknown.

### Facing the facts on prophylactic antibiotics for facial fractures: 1 day or less [^1124VPkw]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the role of initial prophylactic antibiotics on facial fractures, outcomes were compared between a short course (≤ 24 hours) of antibiotics to those who received an extended course (> 24 hours).

Methods

Adults admitted (2010–2015) to a Level I trauma center intensive care unit with at least one facial bone fracture and major injuries isolated to the head and neck were included. Our primary analysis compared infectious complications of the head or neck (H/N infection) between patients given short or extended courses of antibiotic prophylaxis. Multivariate logistic regression and analysis of propensity score matched pairs were performed.

Results

A total of 403 patients were included, 85.6% had blunt injuries and 72.7% had their facial fracture managed nonoperatively. The H/N infection rate was 11.2%. Two hundred eighty patients received a short course of antibiotics and 123 patients received an extended course. Median Injury Severity Score was 14 in both groups (p = 0.78). Patients receiving an extended course of antibiotics had higher rates of H/N infection (20.3% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Factors associated with development of H/N infection included younger age, penetrating injury, open fracture, upper face or mandible fracture, fractures in multiple facial thirds, vascular injury, hypertension, and extended antibiotic course. Multivariate logistic regression identified younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–1.00; p = 0.02), multiple facial third fractures (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4–10.2; p < 0.001), and penetrating mechanism (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5–6.4; p = 0.003) as independent predictors of H/N infection, but not antibiotic duration. Propensity score-matched analysis found no differences in H/N infection between short and extended antibiotic courses (11.4% vs. 12.5%; p = 1.0). Subgroup analyses demonstrated no differences in H/N infection between short or extended antibiotic courses by injury pattern, mechanism, or treatment (operative or nonoperative).

Conclusion

These results lead us to believe that we should limit antibiotics to 24 hours or less upon admission for facial fractures.

Central nervous system

Pneumocephalus

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of pneumocephalus?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should not be used in patients with post-traumatic pneumocephalus.

Discussion: Traumatic pneumocephalus is defined as air within the cranial vault and is suggestive of an open skull fracture or communication with the sinuses. Pneumocephalus is often included in studies evaluating the utility of prophylactic antibiotics for basilar skull fractures. Randomized trials evaluating basilar skull fractures by Eftekhar et al and earlier by Hoff et al reported no advantage of the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus. Recently, a large retrospective study evaluated the utility of different prophylactic antibiotic regiments for traumatic pneumocephalus. In addition to demonstrating central nervous system (CNS) infection to be very rare in the setting of traumatic pneumocephalus with an incidence of approximately 1%, the authors found no protective advantage to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^111ec8b3]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

It should be acknowledged that in cases of FRI, there is often the presence of a fracture (ie, instability). A period of 6 weeks without fracture stability is not advisable. External fixation could be used, although chances are higher of developing an infection (ie, pin tracts) after a period of long-term external fixation followed by internal fixation. Therefore, in some cases, a two-stage exchange with a short interval can be considered. Here, a period of 1–2 weeks of temporary fracture fixation, again the type of fixation is at the discretion of the treating surgeon, is advisable until culture results are known and targeted systemic and local antibiotic therapy can be started. The total treatment duration remains 12 weeks.

Cases of segmental bone resection without internal fixation (eg, ring fixator) are an exception. Here, all dead and infected bone should be removed, and the multidisciplinary team needs to decide whether a long course of antibiotic treatment is necessary. It may be sufficient to give 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy to eradicate the residual contamination in the soft tissue.

The experts acknowledge that there are multiple different treatment strategies available, with a lack of evidence supporting one over the other (Fig. 1). In addition, scientific data on duration of antimicrobial treatment in FRI remain scarce. They suggest that every patient receives an individualized treatment plan that is confirmed by the multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, future studies are warranted to give better insights into the optimal treatment strategy.

### Surgical management of depressed cranial fractures [^113dWS6h]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Indications

Patients with open (compound) cranial fractures depressed greater than the thickness of the cranium should undergo operative intervention to prevent infection. Patients with open (compound) depressed cranial fractures may be treated nonoperatively if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of dural penetration, significant intracranial hematoma, depression greater than 1 cm, frontal sinus involvement, gross cosmetic deformity, wound infection, pneumocephalus, or gross wound contamination. Nonoperative management of closed (simple) depressed cranial fractures is a treatment option.

Timing

Early operation is recommended to reduce the incidence of infection.

Methods

Elevation and debridement is recommended as the surgical method of choice. Primary bone fragment replacement is a surgical option in the absence of wound infection at the time of surgery. All management strategies for open (compound) depressed fractures should include antibiotics.

### Utility of prophylactic antibiotics in nonoperative facial fractures [^111TWBJk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Facial fractures are commonly managed nonoperatively. Patients with facial fractures involving sinus cavities commonly receive 7 to 10 days of prophylactic antibiotics, yet no literature exists to support or refute this practice. The aim of this study was to compare the administration and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of soft tissue infection in nonoperative facial fractures. A total number of 289 patients who were admitted to our level I trauma center with nonoperative facial fractures from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2014 were studied. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: no antibiotic prophylaxis, short-term antibiotic prophylaxis (1–5 days), and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (> 5 days). The primary outcome was the incidence of facial soft tissue infection and Clostridium difficile colitis. Fifty patients received no antibiotic prophylaxis. Sixty-three patients completed a short course of antibiotic prophylaxis and 176 patients received long-term antibiotics. Ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a combination of both were used in 216 patients. Twenty-three patients received clindamycin due to penicillin allergy. Short and long courses of antibiotic prophylaxis were administered more commonly in patients with concomitant maxillary and orbital fractures (P < 0.0001). No mortality was found in any group. Soft tissue infection was not identified in any patient. C. difficile colitis was identified in 1 patient who had received a long course of antibiotic prophylaxis (P = 0.7246). There was no difference in the outcome of patients receiving short-term, long-term, and no antibiotic prophylaxis. Prospective randomized studies are needed to provide further clinical recommendations.

Cerebrospinal fluid leaks

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in patients with post-traumatic CSF leaks.

Discussion: As mentioned above, basilar skull fractures are thought to predispose patients to CNS infections due to possible direct contact of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, or middle ear. CSF leakage has been associated with a greater risk of contracting meningitis, encephalitis, and ventriculitis. CSF leakage often presents clinically as rhinorrhea or otorrhea. The incidence of meningitis in patients with post-traumatic CSF leaks varies widely with 10% being a generally accepted rate of infection. Antibiotics are often given prophylactically, although their role in preventing bacterial meningitis has not been established. Eftekhar et al evaluated the use of ceftriaxone for meningitis prophylaxis in patients with basilar skull fractures. Ceftriaxone has broader gram-negative coverage and CNS penetration. They found no difference in the incidence of meningitis between those who received antibiotics and those who did not when adjusted for the presence of CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea. Similarly, Demetriades et al using ceftriaxone or ampicillin/sulfadiazine and Klastersky et al using penicillin G evaluated the incidence of meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures and CSF leaks. Again, no significant difference in the incidence of meningitis in the antibiotic groups was noted when compared with those who did not receive antibiotics. Lastly, in a Cochrane meta-analysis, no benefit with the use of prophylactic antibiotics was found in patients with basilar skull fractures with or without CSF leakage. Ratilal et al found no difference in the frequency of meningitis, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality, and need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage with the use of prophylactic antibiotics.

SBO is a life-threatening disease that requires a high index of suspicion based on these patients complex underlying medical co-morbidities and clinician's acumen. Once a diagnosis is made, is it critical to communicate and work closely with other multidisciplinary teams (neuroradiology for appropriate choice of imaging study and interpretation; infectious disease for appropriate medical treatment and duration; internist to properly manage their underlying medical co-morbidities). Despite advances in imaging, the diagnosis is first made based on clinical judgment, appropriate culture, and tissue biopsy.

### The role of postoperative antibiotics in facial fractures: comparing the efficacy of a 1-day versus a prolonged regimen [^111Ujxm8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of the duration of postoperative antibiotics (1 day vs. ≥ 5 days) on wound infections following surgical treatment of facial fractures.

Methods

Three hundred thirty-nine patient case histories with a total of 498 fractures were reviewed retrospectively with regard to infections occurring within a 6-month period following surgical management. Patients were divided into two groups based on the duration of postoperative antibiotics administered. Group A consisted of 125 patients who had 1 day of postoperative antibiotics, whereas Group B consisted of 214 patients who had five or more days of postoperative antibiotics. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess for possible differences in the rate of postoperative infections.

Results

Five patients in Group A (4%) and seven patients in Group B (3.27%) developed infections within the follow-up period. Of these 12 patients, seven had sustained multiple facial bone fractures. Eleven infections occurred in patients with mandibular fractures and one in a midfacial fracture. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test showed no significant difference (p = 0.77) in the incidence of infection between Groups A and B.

Conclusion

In this retrospective study, the use of prolonged postoperative antibiotics in uncomplicated mandibular and midfacial fractures had no significant benefit in reducing the incidence of infections.

Facial and scalp lacerations

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of facial and scalp lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for through-and-through lacerations from the skin to the oral cavity and in the setting of mammalian bites to the face. Prophylactic antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed for simple facial and scalp lacerations; however, 24 hours or less should be considered in cases with higher infection risk: wounds with significant tissue destruction, large dead space, extensive contamination, or patients with underlying medical problems that increase their risk of infection (table 2).

Discussion: Caruso et al wrote a detailed review of the evidence for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in traumatic craniomaxillofacial injuries in 2022, nicely summarizing the available literature. Much of this discussion will draw from that review, as well as the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. There is a general lack of adequate evidence to guide decision-making for these injuries, and Caruso et al appropriately counsel that thoughtful consideration of the patient, wound, and underlying pathophysiology must be used to make decisions when there is no clear guidance from the data. Compared with injuries to the rest of the body, injuries to the head and neck tend to have the lowest rates of infectious complications. This is likely due to the excellent blood supply to this region of the body. For clinical scenarios of 'normal' risk (a simple wound in a healthy patient), prophylactic antibiotics do not confer a benefit and should not be used. However, wound characteristics (bites, farming injuries, crush injuries, gross contamination, devitalized tissue, etc) and patient characteristics (diabetes, immunosuppression, steroids, extremes of age, obesity, etc) need to be factored into an assessment of overall infection risk.

Open fracture antibiotics — perioperative duration: Scheduled dosing of antibiotics should be continued until surgical management is performed. A minimum of 24 hours of antibiotics should be administered from the start of the surgical procedure. Generally, antimicrobials are discontinued 24 hours after the procedure, but continuation for up to 72 hours may be appropriate for highly contaminated wounds. Antibiotics should not be administered beyond 72 hours unless a second operative intervention occurs within that time period.

### Contemporary management of pediatric open skull fractures: a multicenter pediatric trauma center study [^111Bj1DW]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors sought to evaluate the contemporary management of pediatric open skull fractures and assess the impact of variations in antibiotic and operative management on the incidence of infectious complications.

Methods

The records of children who presented from 2009 to 2017 to 6 pediatric trauma centers with an open calvarial skull fracture were reviewed. Data collected included mechanism and anatomical site of injury; presence and depth of fracture depression; antibiotic choice, route, and duration; operative management; and infectious complications.

Results

Of the fractures among the 138 patients included in the study, 48.6% were frontal and 80.4% were depressed; 58.7% of patients underwent fragment elevation. The average duration of intravenous antibiotics was 4.6 (range 0–21) days. Only 53 patients (38.4%) received a single intravenous antibiotic for fewer than 4 days. and 56 (40.6%) received oral antibiotics for an average of 7.3 (range 1–20) days. Wounds were managed exclusively in the emergency department in 28.3% of patients. Two children had infectious complications, including a late-presenting hardware infection and a superficial wound infection. There were no cases of meningitis or intracranial abscess. Neither antibiotic spectrum or duration nor bedside irrigation was associated with the development of infection.

Conclusions

The incidence of infectious complications in this population of children with open skull fractures was low and was not associated with the antibiotic strategy or site of wound care. Most minimally contaminated open skull fractures are probably best managed with a short duration of a single antibiotic, and emergency department closure is appropriate unless there is significant contamination or fragment elevation is necessary.

Basilar skull fracture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak — pneumococcal vaccination is recommended (strong, moderate). Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen in the setting of head trauma and a CSF leak, it is reasonable to try to prevent infections with this organism using pneumococcal vaccination. For unimmunized children aged 6–18 years and adults aged ≥ 19 years with CSF leak, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be administered first followed at least 8 weeks later with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended both vaccines administered in series, with the polysaccharide vaccine given 6–12 months after the conjugate vaccine in all pneumococcal vaccine-naive adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### A management algorithm for cerebrospinal fluid leak associated with anterior skull base fractures: detailed clinical and radiological follow-up [^116SkdFM]. Neurosurgical Review (2012). Low credibility.

Detailed outcome data for the management of anterior skull base fractures associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is lacking. We present detailed follow-up data of a single-center study using a predetermined algorithm for the management of CSF leakage secondary to traumatic fractures. A number of 138 consecutive patients were included in the analysis; all patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning at time of admission with β₂-transferrin testing used to confirm CSF leakage. Patients with acute surgical indications were operated as emergent; leaks were repaired at the time of initial surgery in patients with intracranial pressure < 15 cm H₂O. The remainder of the study population was managed conservatively including use of prophylactic antibiotics; lumbar drainage (LD) catheters were placed in those patients with leakage persisting beyond 48 h. Leaks lasting longer than 5 days underwent microsurgical repair using an intradural bicoronal approach. One-year follow-up assessment included evaluation of neurological status, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and repeat head CT. Twenty eight patients (26.9%) underwent emergent surgery, 15 of whom had simultaneous CSF leak repair, whereas 76 patients (73.1%) underwent delayed CSF leak repair between days 5 and 14. Postoperative meningitis rate was low (1.9%). Postoperative CSF leak (1.9%) was managed by intradural or transnasal endoscopic operation. Comparable rates of anosmia and frontal lobe hypodensities were seen in the surgical and conservatively managed subgroups. The presented algorithm, utilizing prophylactic antibiotics, trial of LD, acute and/or delayed intradural microsurgery, yields favorable outcomes. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to better define the role of prophylactic antibiotics and to better characterize the optimal timing and approach of surgical repair.

There is high quality evidence and current supporting guidelines that prefer alcohol‐based chlorhexidine solution. There is overall high‐quality evidence that chlorhexidine in alcohol is the skin preparation of choice. Povidone may be a suitable alternative if used in alcohol and not as the aqueous solution, particularly for orthopedic procedures.

12. Antibiotic prophylaxis and duration

Trauma patients constitute a high‐risk population prone to infection, as trauma and interventions can disrupt the body's natural barriers, leading to contamination. Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a commonly used intervention in trauma care aimed at reducing infection rates However, after decades of liberal antibiotic use, the emergence of drug‐resistant bacteria pose an increasing risk. The use of AP should adhere to current available evidence to maximize its benefits while minimizing the risk of misuse. Two distinct trauma‐related conditions are included: meningitis in severe skull fractures, and central nervous system (CNS) infection in external ventricular drains (EVD) or intra‐cranial pressure (ICP) monitors.

An updated Cochrane systematic review and meta‐analysis on AP for preventing meningitis in basilar skull fractures was published in 2015. The review did not identify any new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared to the previous review in 2011 by the same group but it included five RCTs for analysis. Additionally, they identified 17 non‐RCTs for analysis. The review does not support the use of AP in patients with basilar fractures, regardless of the presence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Furthermore, the results from non‐RCTs were consistent with those from the randomized data.

A single‐center case series with a systematic review, published in 2023, evaluated AP for penetrating traumatic brain injury. Although the literature review did not reveal any significant benefit of AP, all patients who did not receive AP developed CNS infection in their case series. Consequently, the authors proposed a short course of therapeutic antibiotics for patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^116s4idr]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Open fractures — key messages define that open fractures occur when a fractured bone is exposed to contamination from the external environment through a disruption of the skin and subcutaneous tissues and are susceptible to infection. Patients with open fractures should receive intravenous antimicrobials within one hour of presentation to reduce the risk of infection, and patients with Gustilo open type 1 or 2 fractures should receive a first-generation cephalosporin (for example, cefazolin). Gram negative coverage should be considered in patients with Gustilo type 3 fractures (for example, gentamicin), and the addition of a penicillin for anaerobic coverage should be considered in the presence of severe contamination or impaired vascularity; in the presence of documented β-lactam allergies, consider regimens with a similar spectrum of coverage. Antibiotics should be administered for no longer than 24 hours after a surgical procedure, and in cases of severe contamination antibiotics may be continued for as long as 72 hours after a surgical procedure.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^114Cdnam]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Debridement with One- or Two-Stage Exchange of the Implant

A 1- or 2-stage exchange is performed if patients without bone union do not qualify for eradicative or suppressive treatment with implant retention. A total duration of 12 weeks of biofilm-active therapy is recommended in a 1-stage exchange with intravenous treatment until full antibiotic susceptibility results of the cultures are available.

A 2-stage exchange with an implant-free interval at the site of infection can be required if no biofilm-active antimicrobial is available, surgical factors are unfavorable (eg, soft-tissue status), or suppressive therapy is not an adequate option. This requires temporary stabilization of the fracture, with the type of fixation being at the discretion of the treating surgeon. During the implant-free interval, 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment without biofilm activity is recommended, starting with intravenous treatment until full antibiotic susceptibility results of the cultures are available. After the first 6 weeks of treatment, 2 different approaches exist with no consensus and a lack of data on the optimal continuation therapy. One approach consists of an immediate reimplantation followed by further 6 weeks of biofilm-active treatment. The other allows a 2-week antibiotic-free interval before reimplantation to see whether clinical signs of infection reoccur and to enable regrowth of potential residual bacteria. If no clinical signs of infection occur and tissue cultures from reimplantation stay negative, the antibiotics that were restarted after implantation can be stopped (Fig. 1).

### Utility of antibiotic use in pediatric facial fractures: a systematic review [^113AS1Fn]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: In regard to antibiotic stewardship, it is important to understand the appropriate time to prescribe antibiotics in pediatric facial fracture management. Objective: To evaluate the utility of antibiotics in pediatric facial fractures and determine situational variables influencing appropriate antibiotic prescription. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for articles published from 2000 to 2022. Inclusion criteria consisted of all studies assessing pediatric facial fractures that mentioned antibiotic use. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the full review. The reviewed studies comprised 31 pediatric patients ranging from 6 months to 18 years old. Most studies were case reports and case series (N = 9). Antibiotics were prescribed for the majority (96.7%) of patients. Antibiotic regimens varied by timing of administration, antibiotic used, and dosage. Fracture locations also varied widely, including orbital, zygomatic, nasal, mandibular, and maxillary fractures. Conclusions: Additional studies with more substantial evidence are needed to fully understand the situational appropriateness of antibiotic use in pediatric facial fractures.

### A multidisciplinary evaluation of prescribing practices for prophylactic antibiotics in operative and nonoperative facial fractures [^116FKeQJ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence supports short-term perioperative prophylaxis for facial fractures. It is unknown, however, whether there is any professional consensus on how to manage these injuries. No multidisciplinary evaluation of the prophylactic antibiotic prescribing patterns for neither operative nor nonoperative facial fractures has been performed.

Aim

To evaluate the prophylactic antibiotic prescribing patterns of multiple specialties in operative and nonoperative facial fractures.

Methods

A 14 question anonymous online-based survey was distributed to members of the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons (ASMS) and the American Association of Facial Plastic Surgeons to evaluate current practices.

Results and Conclusions

205 respondents, including 89 plastic surgeons, 98 otolaryngologists, 12 oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and 7 with double board certification practicing throughout the United States with ranging experience from 11 to 30 years. As expected, preoperative, perioperative, or postoperative prophylactic antibiotics are either "always" or "sometimes" prescribed, 100% of the time with more varied practice upon further inspection. A total of 85.1% either "always" or "sometimes" use antibiotics while awaiting surgery. Dentate segment fractures are the most frequent type of facial fractures to receive prophylactic antibiotics for both operative (90.5%) and nonoperative (84.1%) fractures. Duration of antibiotic use is more varied with the majority providing 3 to 7 days despite current evidence. First generation cephalosporins alone are prescribed by 49% of respondents, which may not adequately cover oral flora. There is no multidisciplinary consensus for prophylactic antibiotics for specific operative fracture types or nonoperative facial fractures, an area with little published evidence.

### Mixed results with oral antibiotics for fracture-related infections… [^115WbgE2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The paradigm shift from longer courses and intravenous administration of antibiotics to shorter courses and oral administration continues with this important contribution by Obremskey et al. 1 The authors report on a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the current treatment of fracture-related infections with subsequent debridements up to 1 year, after 6 weeks of IV antibiotics vs oral antibiotics. It remains unknown whether IV and oral antibiotics in this study provided equivalent coverage and tissue penetration. Except for vancomycin, linezolid, and rifampin as an adjunct to IV therapy, the baseline antibiotics administered, doses, frequency, and blood levels for vancomycin are not stated. Assuming antibiotic coverage was adequately addressed, the authors have constructed an appropriate clinical trial.

### Antibiotic duration and postoperative infection rates in mandibular fractures [^116fwYf1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although the use of preoperative antibiotics has been proven effective, the value of postoperative antibiotics in the setting of mandibular fracture remains in question as does the appropriate duration of therapy.

Methods

A retrospective study of all patients 18 years and older who presented with mandibular fractures to St Louis University Hospital between December 2001 and July 2006 was conducted. Collected variables included age, injury severity score, fracture type and location, preoperative antibiotic administration, antibiotic type, duration of antibiotic course, and postoperative infection. Infections were statistically compared with each.

Results

Of 253 identified patients, 197 qualified for study inclusion. A total of 9 postoperative infections were documented. When comparing individuals with postoperative infection to those without, age was the only significant difference between infected and uninfected groups, with older patients more likely to acquire infection. Injury severity score, fracture type, duration of antibiotic course, and antibiotic type were not significantly different.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that patient factors make a greater contribution to postoperative infection when compared with iatrogenic factors in the treatment of mandibular fractures. We found no evidence to support prolonged postoperative antibiotic therapy. Our findings bring into question the need for postoperative antibiotics for the treatment of mandibular fractures.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^117KNjXU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

Question: what is the appropriate selection and duration of perioperative antibiotics in the setting of craniotomy/craniectomy?

Recommendation

A single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis given within 60 minutes prior to incision is recommended for prevention of SSI and meningitis in patients who undergo cranial operative intervention. Cefazolin is usually sufficient but in patients colonized with MRSA or institutions with high rates of MRSA, vancomycin may be warranted.

Discussion

SSI and central nervous system infections after cranial surgery (craniotomy or craniectomy) are rare but can result in lasting morbidity and mortality. Multiple randomized controlled trials from the 1980s demonstrated a significant decrease in SSI and postoperative infections for patients who received perioperative antibiotics, compared with placebo. No recent randomized studies have been published since antibiotic prophylaxis is now considered standard of care; however, a meta-analysis found decreased odds of meningitis in patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis (1.1% vs. 2.7%) compared with patients who did not receive prophylaxis.

S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of SSIs. MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococci infections are less common but are increasing in prevalence. Gram-negative and polymicrobial infections are responsible for a small portion of cases. Multiple studies have shown no difference in infection rates with different antibiotic selections and most studies use a single dose of antibiotics. Therefore, a single dose of cefazolin, given within 60 minutes prior to incision for all patients undergoing craniotomy or craniectomy, is generally recommended as the prophylactic antibiotic of choice. However, there is some evidence for the dual use of cefazolin and vancomycin. Corsini Campioli et al performed a logistic regression to identify predictors of SSI and found dual therapy with cefazolin and vancomycin was associated with fewer SSIs. Although not supported by strong evidence, in institutions with a high prevalence of MRSA, prophylaxis with dual therapy may be considered.

### Defining the appropriate length of antimicrobial therapy for skull base osteomyelitis [^116ipvg6]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a rare infection comprising either the lateral (LSBO), central (CSBO), or both lateral and central (BSBO) skull base. Due to its rarity, the optimal length of antimicrobial therapy (AMT) has not been well defined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify factors that may influence outcomes of SBO and formulate clearer recommendations on AMT duration.

Methods

A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of SBO patients was conducted. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory results, radiographic imaging, surgical treatment, culture results, length of follow-up, and type, length, and number of AMT courses were collected.

Results

Sixty-five patients were included. The average age was 66.5years, and the average length of symptoms (LOS) prior to diagnosis was 3.74months. The most common pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 23) followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 15). The average length of IV AMT was 6.8weeks, and the average total length of AMT (TLA) was 15.7weeks. Positive fungal cultures were associated with longer TLA (22.6 vs. 13.7weeks, p = 0.02) and a greater number of distinct courses of AMT (4.1 vs. 2.7, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

In this series, the average length of IV AMT was 6.8weeks. The average TLA was 15.7weeks, indicating that a minimum of 6weeks of IV AMT followed by a prolonged course of oral AMT is necessary to treat most cases of SBO. Fungal involvement significantly impacts the duration of AMT. Clinical guidelines are needed to better define the management of this complex disease.

### Postoperative prophylactic antibiotics for facial fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HiN4S]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery for maxillofacial fractures is standard practice. However, the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effect of postoperative antibiotic therapy on the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with maxillofacial fractures.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through October 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the efficacy of pre-, peri-, and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing SSI in maxillofacial fractures were included. Data were extracted from studies using a standardized data collection form, with two reviewers independently performing extraction and quality assessment for each study. Risk ratios (RRs) for SSI were pooled using a random-effects model.

Results

Among 2,150 potentially eligible citations, 13 studies met inclusion criteria and provided data to be included in a meta-analysis. The addition of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis to a standard preoperative and/or perioperative antibiotic regimen showed no significant difference in the risk of SSI (RR = 1.11 [95% CI: 0.86–1.44], P > .1). There were also no differences in the risk of SSI when restricting the analysis to mandibular fractures (eight studies, RR = 1.22 [95% CI: 0.92–1.62]) or open surgical techniques (eight studies, RR = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.62–1.67]). A sensitivity analysis did not find any significant differences in risk when restricting to RCTs (seven trials, RR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.61–1.67]) or cohort studies (six studies, RR = 1.21 [95% CI: 0.89–1.63]).

Conclusions

Our findings, along with the available evidence, does not support the routine use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with maxillofacial fractures. Avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotic therapy in the postoperative period could have important implications for healthcare costs and patient outcomes. Laryngoscope, 129:82–95, 2019.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112uHZBe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) is the primary organization responsible for brain injury-related guidelines; however, they have not yet published guidelines related to the management of penetrating brain injury (including antibiotic prophylaxis). A Penetrating Brain Injury Expert Workgroup consisting of a collaboration between the BTF along with military and civilian experts has convened and guidelines to address this issue are expected to be published in the near future. Thus, current recommendations are considerations based on military consensus and retrospective civilian studies. Antibiotic use for external ventricular drainage (EVD), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and their associated infection risk are discussed in the other articles in this series, Fever and Infections in Surgical Intensive Care and Surgical and Procedural Antibiotic Prophylaxis in the Surgical ICU by Nohra et al and Farrell et al, respectively.

Penetrating spine injury

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of penetrating spine injury?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics, no longer than 48 hours, are recommended for low-velocity gunshot wounds (GSW) to the spine (table 2).

Discussion: There has long been clinical concern regarding GSWs to the spine, especially those with gastrointestinal involvement, and the potential to develop spinal or paraspinal infections. As a result, much of the spine literature has advocated prolonged courses of 'prophylactic' antibiotics lasting up to 14 days to prevent infection with the greatest concern involving transcolonic injuries. As no prospective studies exist, these recommendations are based on clinical judgment, older retrospective studies and case series that are underpowered and use varying antibiotic courses lasting up to 6 weeks. The incidence of infection without antibiotic use after penetrating injury is not known which further hampers the interpretation of any available information regarding the necessity or duration of antibiotic use. Additionally, there is very little information regarding stab wounds to the spine and the necessity of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^115GWe3N]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Debridement, Antimicrobial therap, and Implant Retention

No published data are available regarding the duration of antimicrobial treatment in FRI with a retained implant. Treatment is likely to eradicate the infection only if a biofilm-active antibiotic agent is used. Biofilm activity has been clearly demonstrated only for rifampicin combinations against staphylococci and fluoroquinolones against Gram-negative bacteria. – When biofilm-active therapy is possible, a total treatment duration of 12 weeks is recommended, with an initial IV treatment until the patient (eg, polytrauma or intensive care unit patient) and the soft tissue are settled and full antibiotic susceptibility results of the cultures are available. As previously mentioned, IV treatment can be as short as 1 week or even less. When no biofilm-active antibiotics can be given due to resistance, patient intolerance, or potential drug interactions, infections are classified as "difficult-to-treat" and may not be eradicated by antibiotics as long as the implants are retained. In this situation, FRI can likely be suppressed but not eradicated. Similarly, if the first debridement takes place more than 4 weeks after the start of symptoms and the implant cannot be removed/exchanged, antimicrobial therapy may not achieve eradication of the established older biofilms and again may be suppressive rather than eradicative. If a suppressive approach is chosen, antimicrobials should be continued until the fracture is consolidated to the extent that the implant can be removed without compromising stability. One to 2 weeks of continuation after removal is indicated. Importantly, an initially suppressive approach will not be successful if fracture healing is estimated to be very unlikely (eg, instability of the construct) or if no signs of fracture healing can be found over the course of suppressive treatment. There is a lack of published data comparing different suppressive regimens in FRI. As guidance, suppressive therapy needs to be tailored to the susceptibility of the responsible pathogen(s), should have low propensity to induce resistance, should be orally available, and the dosage and antibiotic class should be able to control the infection with minimal side effects and toxicity.

Question: what type and duration of antibiotics should be used for periprocedural prophylaxis in the setting of external ventricular drain placement?

Recommendation

A single dose of preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis is suggested with cefazolin often being sufficient. Given external ventricular drain (EVD)-related infections have a wide variety of reported causative organisms, the local antibiogram should be consulted.

### A systematic review of prophylactic antibiotics in the surgical treatment of maxillofacial fractures [^117VrW8H]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

A systematic review was performed to find evidence for prophylactic administration of antibiotics in relation to treatment of maxillofacial fractures.

Methods

Four studies were retrieved that fulfilled most of the requirements of being randomized controlled clinical trials.

Results

An analysis of these studies showed a 3-fold decrease in the infection rate of mandibular fractures in the antibiotic treated groups compared with the control groups. A variety of antibiotics had been used with an apparently uniform effect. A "1-shot" regimen or a 1-day treatment course had a similar or perhaps even better effect than 7 days of treatment. No infections were related to condylar, maxillary, or zygoma fractures.

Conclusion

A 1-shot or 1-day administration of prophylactic antibiotics seem to be the best documented to reduce infections in the management of mandibular fractures not involving the condylar region.

### Algorithmic approach to antibiotic prophylaxis for traumatic craniomaxillofacial injuries [^113V2iSw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Prophylactic antibiotics are commonly used in the management of traumatic injuries to the maxillofacial complex, yet there are no set guidelines for when and when not to prescribe. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis in different clinical scenarios and to propose algorithms to facilitate the decision making process with the ultimate goal of improving antibiotic prescribing practices. A number of databases were searched using a wide range of keywords to ensure the topic was fully encapsulated. The review is divided into 3 sections: soft tissue trauma, maxillofacial fractures, and ballistic injuries. The algorithms were constructed using the current evidence as well as pathophysiologic principles, especially when there were insufficient studies. This review found the literature on antibiotic prophylaxis to be highly varied and not standardized. Creating an algorithm for providers to follow will help to set a standard of care and decrease the misuse of antibiotics.

### Oral vs intravenous antibiotics for fracture-related infections… [^114LfF5p]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Oral and IV antibiotics appear to have similar results treating infection after fracture surgery in terms of the primary outcome of number of surgical interventions and the secondary outcome of reinfection in the preplanned, unadjusted analysis; however, the findings are less clear in additional preplanned and post hoc secondary analyses conducted due to crossover and imbalance between randomized groups. Importance Fracture-related infection is a serious complication following fracture fixation surgery. Current treatment of FRIs entails debridement and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Lab data and retrospective clinical studies support use of oral antibiotics, which are less expensive and may have fewer complications than IV antibiotics. Intervention Oral vs IV antibiotics following FRI.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was number of surgical interventions, and the primary hypothesis was noninferiority of oral vs IV antibiotics with respect to the number of study injury–related surgical interventions by 1 year. Unadjusted modified intent-to-treat and adjusted per-protocol analyses were prespecified. A post hoc adjusted mITT analysis was conducted to resolve discrepancies between the results of the prespecified mITT and PP analyses. Recurrence of a deep surgical site infection was a key secondary outcome. Results Among 233 total patients, mean age was 46. 0 years, and 53 patients were female. The mean number of surgical interventions within 1 year was 1. 3 and

1. 1 for the oral and IV groups, respectively. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference with unadjusted mITT analysis was 0. 59, which was lower than the prespecified noninferiority margin of
0.

67, indicating noninferiority of oral to IV antibiotics. Adjusted PP analysis did not support noninferiority of the number of reoperations. A post hoc adjusted mITT analysis also showed noninferiority. The treatment effects estimates for the key secondary outcome of reinfection showed a similar pattern as those for the primary outcome. Conclusions and Relevance. In this prospective randomized clinical trial, oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to IV treatment with respect to the primary outcome of number of surgical interventions based on mITT analysis. However, there is some uncertainty in these findings based on preplanned and post hoc secondary analyses. A similar pattern of treatment effect estimates was observed for the secondary outcome of recurrence of infection.

Treatment details

Twenty-three percent of patients (n = 60) underwent I&D, 67% (n = 171) underwent irrigation without debridement, and the remainder (10%, n = 25) did not receive any debridement or irrigation. Fifty-eight percent (n = 148) of patients underwent ORIF, and almost all patients (98%, n = 249) received intravenous antibiotics. Among patients undergoing I&D, the median time to I&D was 27 hours, 47% (n = 28) received early treatment, and 18% underwent at least two I&D procedures. Among those receiving irrigation with no debridement, the median time to irrigation was 6 hours, 78% (n = 134) received early treatment, and 12% (n = 20) received at least two irrigations. Among patients undergoing ORIF, the median time to ORIF was 24 hours, 51% (n = 76) received early treatment, and 24% (n = 35) underwent at least two ORIF procedures. Among patients receiving antibiotics, the median time to initiation was 1 hour, and 57% (n = 143) received early treatment. For the initial prophylactic antibiotic course, 49% (n = 123) received a cephalosporin-class antibiotic, 29% (n = 72) received a penicillin-beta lactam combination, 18% (n = 46) received a lincomycin, and 2% (n = 4) received a penicillin alone. Other antibiotic classes administered as prophylactic courses included aminoglycoside (1%, n = 2), a penicillin-glycoprotein combination (1%, n = 1), and nitroimidazole (1%, n = 1). The median prophylactic antibiotic course was 1 day.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^1161F6np]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence based on Q2 studies 8–12 was initially considered of high quality, but downgraded due to impreciseness and indirectness. All five studies included a total of 14,486 children with MHT, primarily GCS score 14 to 15, although two studies also included some with GCS score 9 to 13. Although not consequently specified, we could assume that none of the patients included in these studies had focal neurological deficits. We therefore conclude and suggest that patients with GCS scores of 14 to 15 and no neurological deficits and without any pathological findings on CT related to the trauma can be discharged. Three out of five studies included patients with a normal CT only, one study concluded that the finding of a skull base fracture on CT might imply a high risk of the child requiring a longer observation time (> 24 h) than provided in their observation unit and in the last study, although it included patients with basilar skull fractures, there were not enough data to draw conclusions about early discharge when there is no intracranial injury in the presence of a basilar skull fracture. This latter issue was discussed in the consensus part before finalisation of the guidelines (see Guidelines).

### Indications for medical antibiotic prophylaxis and potential targets for antimicrobial stewardship intervention: a narrative review [^1148Gx5x]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) literature has focused on antimicrobial consumption for the treatment of infections, for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection and for the prevention of endocarditis. The role of AMS for medical antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) has not been adequately addressed.

Aims

To identify targets for AMS interventions for medical AP in adult patients.

Sources

Targeted searches were conducted in PubMed.

Content

The various indications for medical AP and relevant evidence from practice guidelines are outlined. The following were identified as potential targets for AMS interventions: (a) addressing under-utilization of antibiotic-sparing strategies (e.g. for recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent soft-tissue infections, recurrent exacerbations associated with bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), (b) reducing unnecessary AP beyond recommended indications (e.g. for acute pancreatitis, bite wounds, or urinary catheter manipulations), (c) reducing the use of AP with a broader spectrum than necessary, (d) reducing the use of AP for longer than the recommended duration (e.g. AP for prevention of osteomyelitis in open fractures or AP in high-risk neutropenia), (e) evaluating the role of antibiotic cycling to prevent the emergence of resistance during prolonged AP (e.g. in recurrent urinary tract infections or prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and (f) addressing research gaps regarding appropriate indications or antibiotic regimens for medical prophylaxis.

Implications

This review summarizes current trends in AP and proposes targets for AMS interventions.

Soft tissue injury

Of note, the focus of this section is on civilian trauma, with the acknowledgment that military-grade (ie, higher energy) weapons are sometimes used in civilian trauma. Further, this review will focus on isolated soft tissue injuries that are not associated with underlying bony or hollow viscus injury.

Simple lacerations (other than face and scalp)

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of simple lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple soft tissue lacerations. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: There are no recent data to support prophylactic antibiotics for uncomplicated, traumatic soft tissue lacerations. Most high-quality evidence on this topic is over 20 years old, and supports avoiding antibiotics, while much of the recent literature is focused on soft tissue injury with underlying open fractures but does not address isolated soft tissue injury. Overall, the studies emphasize the importance of adequate irrigation, debridement, removal of foreign bodies, and appropriate closure technique as the major means of infection prevention. While the little data that exist generally support forgoing antibiotic prophylaxis, it is important to identify the cases that are more complex and thus may have different management considerations. Moran et al provide a useful approach, advising the consideration of both high-risk wounds and high-risk patients, which may affect a clinician's decision to give antibiotic prophylaxis. The WHO provides a similar framework for wound assessment that includes size, contamination, and other high-risk factors. Clinicians should work from a baseline understanding that in most simple, traumatic soft tissue wounds in civilian patients, prophylactic antibiotics are likely unnecessary, and then adjust only on the basis of specific patient-related or wound-related risk factors or concerns. Additionally, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

External ventricular drains — ventriculitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection rates and risk factors are summarized as follows: in patients with external ventricular drains, the incidence of ventriculitis has ranged from 0% to 22%. A large metaanalysis reported an overall pooled incidence of external ventricular drain–related CSF infection of 11.4 per 1000 catheter-days (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.3–13.5), with high-quality studies showing 10.6 per 1000 catheter-days (95% CI, 8.3–13). Factors associated with an increased risk of infection are intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage, cranial fracture with CSF leak, catheter irrigation, craniotomy, and duration of catheterization, and most studies consider extended catheter duration (usually exceeding 5 days) to be an important risk factor for subsequent infection. Reported rates by duration include an overall external ventricular drain infection rate of 19.6 per 1000 catheter-days, 12.8 per 1000 catheter-days for drains in place for 7–10 days, and 8 per 1000 catheter-days for drains in place for more than 10 days.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^116WMrJs]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Open fractures are at increased risk of infection because of exposure of tissue and bone to the environment, and common treatment protocols involve early initiation of prophylactic antibiotics, wound irrigation and debridement (I&D), and surgical stabilization and repair of the fracture, for example, via open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). Despite infection rates as high as 20% to 40%, open fractures of the face are more likely to receive delayed treatment than open fractures of other locations. Facial fractures are often accompanied by other, more severe injuries such as head trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention, pulmonary injuries or an obstructed airway requiring intubation or tracheostomy, rib fractures, or cervical spine injury; this is especially true with high-energy mechanisms of injury such as motor vehicle collisions. These concurrent injuries can be life-threatening and may require delaying management of the open facial fracture until the patient has stabilized.

Previous studies have generally examined the effects of single aspects of open facial fracture management on infection. For example, it has been demonstrated that short courses of prophylactic antibiotics are generally effective at reducing infection rates during the hospital stay but that postoperative or extended antibiotic courses do not further reduce infection risk. Additionally, I&D, which is essential to remove debris and contaminants from the open fracture wound, has been shown to decrease infection. The effects of early compared with delayed I&D have been reported in open extremity fractures, with studies showing that infection rates did not significantly differ when I&D was performed within 6 hours after hospital arrival, as recommended for open extremity fractures, versus later. However, I&D timing has not been examined in the context of open facial fractures, which are at higher risk of delayed management compared with open extremity fractures.

Previous studies have tended to focus on single aspects of open facial fracture management, such as time to antibiotic initiation or surgical management in isolation. The hypothesis of the current study was that the presence of severe non-facial injuries would be associated with delays in multiple aspects of facial fracture management, including both medical and surgical practices. To address this hypothesis, this study aimed to describe multiple facets of open facial fracture management practices, including prophylactic antibiotics, I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF, and examine factors associated with delays in each type of fracture management. A secondary study aim was to describe the rates of open facial fracture infection in this patient population, both overall and according to early versus delayed fracture management.

In summary, our study suggests that oral antibiotics are not necessary in the management of many patients with orbital fractures. In the posttreatment care of patients after an intravitreal injection, now the standard of care is to not give antibiotics. Likewise, perhaps the standard of care for the management of closed orbital fractures, as determined by the practice patterns of members of ASOPRS, should be to not give oral antibiotics.

### Effect of extended prophylactic antibiotic duration in the treatment of open fracture wounds differs by level of contamination [^116ndm2A]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the association between prophylactic antibiotic duration after the definitive wound closure of an open fracture and deep surgical site infection (SSI).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

41 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway, and India.

Participants

Patients (N = 2400) with open fractures of the extremities who participated in the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) trial.

Intervention

Extended antibiotic prophylaxis, defined as more than 72 hours of continuous antibiotic use after definitive wound closure.

Main Outcome Measurement

Deep SSI diagnosed within 1 year of enrollment.

Results

Forty-two percent of participants received extended antibiotic prophylaxis. Deep SSI prevalence was 5%, 8%, and 23% for wounds with mild, moderate, and severe contamination, respectively. In open fractures with mild contamination, extended antibiotic use showed a trend toward increased odds [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92–2.11] of deep SSI compared with shorter use. No association was found among patients with moderate contamination (aOR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53–2.27). By contrast, extended antibiotic prophylaxis was strongly protective (aOR = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07–0.60) against deep SSI in patients with severe contamination. Propensity score sensitivity analysis results were consistent with these findings.

Conclusions

The evidence suggests differential effects of extended postclosure antibiotic duration on SSI odds contingent on the degree of contamination in open fracture wounds. Although extended antibiotic duration resulted in lower odds of SSI among patients with severely contaminated wounds, we observed a trend toward higher odds of SSI in mildly contaminated wounds.

### Rapidly fatal pneumococcal meningitis following non-penetrating traumatic brain injury [^114DyD32]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A previously healthy young man presented to hospital with severe traumatic brain injury following a motor vehicle collision. Within 24 hours of admission, and despite antibiotic coverage, he developed a fever. On the second day, the source of infection was discovered to be purulent pneumococcal meningitis. At 48 hours post-accident, he developed brain-stem death without evidence of raised intracranial pressure or trans-tentorial herniation. Initial CT scans of the head were essentially normal, but early repeat scans revealed evidence of pneumocephalus and possible frontal bone fracture. Current recommendations do not make room for targeted antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic brain injury patients with traumatic skull fracture. We argue that our case demonstrates the need for aggressive targeted antibiotic prophylaxis in the presence of certain features such as frontal or sphenoid bone fracture and pneumocephalus.

Introduction

As clinicians, we strive to use antibiotics selectively as there is increasing awareness of the importance of antibiotic stewardship and the risk associated with antibiotic overuse. In this clinical consensus document, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Critical Care Committee aims to provide practical guidance to the surgical intensivist on the best practices in the assessment and prophylaxis of adult trauma patients, ≥ 16 years of age, at risk for infection due to their injuries sustained. These recommendations are summarized in tables 1 and 2.

### Prophylactic administration of ceftriaxone for the prevention of meningitis after traumatic pneumocephalus: results of a clinical trial [^113EX9uo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the prophylactic use of ceftriaxone for the prevention of meningitis in patients with acute traumatic pneumocephalus.

Methods

In this prospective, single-institution, randomized clinical trial, 109 patients with mild head injury and traumatic pneumocephalus were randomly assigned to receive or not receive an antibiotic medication (ceftriaxone, 1 g given twice a day) until occurrence of meningitis or at least 5 days after trauma. The patients were followed up for 1 month posttrauma. The 109 patients were divided into two groups: 53 were assigned to the prophylactic antibiotics therapy group and 56 to the control group. The overall rate of meningitis was 20.1% and the rates of meningitis in the two groups were not significantly different. The results were the same when adjusted for the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score, sex, and age, as well as for an intradural location of air, air volume, presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea or CSF otorrhea, radiological sign of a skull base fracture, or intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusions

The results of this study do not substantiate the efficacy of ceftriaxone used in the prevention of meningitis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus after mild head injury or in any specific subgroup of these patients. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and intracranial hemorrhage may be considered primary risk factors for the development of meningitis in patients with posttraumatic pneumocephalus and, in the absence of these symptoms, intradural location of air and air volume greater than 10 mL may be considered secondary risk factors. Further studies in this area are warranted.

### Mid-to long-term results of single-stage surgery for patients with chronic osteomyelitis using a bioabsorbable gentamicin-loaded ceramic carrier [^1142cNsK]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that the presence of gentamicin-resistant bacteria did not significantly correlate with failure. Resistance is reported in laboratory testing based on the levels of antibiotic which can be expected when the drug is given systemically (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints). The local application of gentamicin using Cerament achieves levels of antibiotic which are much greater than serum levels and well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration for many organisms. It has been shown that only bacteria with very high MICs (> 1,024 mg/l) can survive these local levels of antibiotics. No cultures identified new resistance to gentamicin in patients with recurrent infection.

In the past, we and others have reported a higher incidence of fracture through osteomyelitic defects after surgery, and many patients have required secondary bone grafting to prevent fracture. In this series, no patient had a bone graft and only three suffered a fracture. Cerament G is injected as a thick liquid and can coat the surface of the bone. It hardens to a material with similar compressive strength to cancellous bone. Remodelling occurs over a period of at least two years, with the initial formation of woven bone which is slowly remodelled to lamellar bone. This occurs without a cartilage phase and represents direct bone formation on the biomaterial. All three of our fractures occurred within 11 months of surgery, supporting the view that continued new bone formation in the defect, over many months, may protect from subsequent fracture.

The ability to fill the dead space completely with a material which will deliver antibiotics over several weeks, and then be remodelled, allows a single operation, which is more patient-friendly. With no further hospital admissions, it may also offer cost savings when compared with routine staged treatment.

In conclusion, we have applied this protocol to all patients, regardless of comorbidities, requirement for flaps, or nature of infection. Single-stage management, facilitated by the bioabsorbable antibiotic carrier, was robust, giving effective treatment in all these groups in the mid to long term.

Take home message

- Single-stage surgery, facilitated by a bioabsorbable local antibiotic, was highly effective in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis over a prolonged period.

- Adverse events were infrequent and easily managed.

- The protocol, delivered by a multidisciplinary team, was more patient-friendly than previous treatments.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^1123vmnV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Associations with early versus delayed treatment

In adjusted analyses, a number of patient factors were independently associated with early vs delayed open facial fracture management (table 2). Of note, table 2 only displays variables showing statistically significant associations; a table displaying all associations with early versus delayed treatment is included as online supplemental table 1. Among those receiving I&D, early treatment was associated with going to the OR within 24 hours of arrival (OR early = 377.26, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with maxillary fractures (OR early = 0.05, p < 0.01) and concomitant serious head injury (OR early = 0.04, p < 0.01). Among patients receiving irrigation without debridement, early treatment was associated with nasal fractures (OR early = 37.70, p < 0.01) and OR within 24 hours (OR early = 13.54, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with moderate/severe TBI (OR early = 0.09, p < 0.01). In patients undergoing ORIF, early treatment was associated with concomitant serious abdominal injury (OR early = 35.90, p = 0.01) and OR within 24 hours (OR early = 154.92, p < 0.01), and delayed treatment was associated with moderate/severe TBI (OR early = 0.10, p < 0.01), maxillary fractures (OR early = 0.14, p < 0.01), and concomitant serious head injury (OR early = 0.14, p < 0.01). In patients that received antibiotics, delays in initiation were associated with concomitant serious neck injury (OR early = 0.39, p = 0.04).

However, "nonoperative management may be attempted in selected cases, limited to those without dural laceration, gross contamination, evidence of infection, or injury to the frontal sinus".

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1167az7E]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern with facial lacerations is potential communication with the oral cavity, which carries a significant bacterial load. Lacerations that are confined to the intraoral cavity (including mucous membranes, the lips, and the tongue) and do not communicate with the extraoral environment do not need antibiotics. Through-and-through lacerations have been considered at higher risk for infection, and therefore antibiotics are often suggested, although this remains controversial given the limited data. There are almost no specific data to inform antibiotic prophylaxis for scalp wounds specifically, so it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the management of other traumatic soft tissue wounds. Traumatic cartilage exposure (ear, nose) has historically been treated with prophylactic antibiotics (often fluoroquinolones) in addition to local wound care due to concern for perichondritis. Fluoroquinolones have been used because pseudomonas is a common cause of all-cause perichondritis, but most of these cases are related to piercings, and it is unclear whether the trauma population follows the same microbial pattern. Evidence to support systemic antibiotics in these injuries is lacking. Thus, as above, we think a practical approach would be to risk stratify the wound and the patient and use antibiotics only sparingly in truly high-risk situations.

Nasal packing

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of nasal packing?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in the setting of nasal packing for traumatic epistaxis given a lack of data showing benefit.

Discussion: Nasal packing material is often placed when other efforts at controlling epistaxis have failed. Packing can stay in place for an amount of time varying from a few hours to many days. Infectious concerns with nasal packing include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and toxic shock syndrome. However, multiple recent studies have found routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to be neither effective at reducing infection rates nor cost-effective given the risks and complications of antibiotics. Rates of infection associated with nasal packing are very low at baseline, and cases of toxic shock syndrome secondary to nasal packing are almost non-existent from the last decade. Due to this low infection rate, the many small studies that have attempted to study the role of empiric antibiotic prophylaxis are grossly underpowered to show any significant difference.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^1176AtdU]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated factors associated with delays in multiple facets of open facial fracture management, finding that approximately half of patients received early surgical fracture management. Although analyses of associations with infection were not possible because of the rarity of the outcome in this patient population, the percentage of patients developing infection did not appear to be substantially higher among those with delayed fracture management. Although previous studies have reported separately on the impact of individual aspects of open fracture management, such as I&Dand early initiation of antibiotics, this study included prophylactic antibiotics, I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF.

Almost all patients received at least one aspect of fracture management, with 98% receiving prophylactic antibiotics, 68% undergoing ORIF, 67% undergoing irrigation without debridement, and 23% undergoing I&D. Among those receiving each type of fracture management, approximately half or more received early treatment, ranging from 47% for early I&D to 78% for early irrigation without debridement. When examining factors associated with early versus delayed treatment, consistent with previous findings, there were associations between serious non-facial injuries and delays in open facial fracture management: patients with serious head injury or moderate/severe TBI were more likely to receive delayed I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF. It is possible that in these patients, emergency triage or surgical intervention for the serious head injury took precedence over open facial fracture management. Additionally, going directly from the ED to the OR was not associated with early surgical fracture management (I&D or ORIF), but going to the OR within 24 hours of arrival was; this again may suggest that immediate surgeries focused on emergency triage and that fracture management was addressed during later returns to the OR.

### Severe infectious complications following frontal sinus fracture: the impact of operative delay and perioperative antibiotic use [^113S22bj]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a delay in operative management of frontal sinus fractures is associated with increased risk of serious infections.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed of 242 consecutive patients with surgically managed frontal sinus fractures who presented to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center between 1996 and 2011. Collected patient characteristics included demographics, surgical management, hospital course, and complications. All computed tomographic imaging was reviewed to evaluate involvement of the posterior table and nasofrontal outflow tract. Serious infections included meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, frontal sinus abscess, and osteomyelitis. Delayed operative interventions were defined as procedures performed more than 48 hours after admission. Adjusted relative risk estimates were obtained using multivariable regression.

Results

There were 14 serious infections (5.8 percent). All patients with serious infections had both involvement of the posterior table and nasofrontal outflow tract injury. The cumulative incidence of serious infection in these patients was 10.8 percent. After adjustments for confounding, multivariable regression showed that operative delay beyond 48 hours was independently associated with a 4.03-fold (p < 0.05) increased risk for serious infection; external cerebrospinal fluid drainage catheter use and local soft-tissue infection conferred a 4.09-fold (p < 0.05) and 5.10-fold (p < 0.001) increased risk, respectively. Antibiotic use beyond 48 hours postoperatively was not associated with fewer infections.

Conclusions

Delay in operative management of frontal sinus fractures in patients requiring operative intervention is associated with an increased risk for serious infections. Continued antibiotic prophylaxis beyond the perioperative period provides little benefit in preventing serious infections.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use for penetrating trauma in prolonged casualty care: a review of the literature and current guidelines [^114fjVb4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Prolonged casualty care (PCC), previously known as prolonged field care, is a system to provide patient care for extended periods of time when evacuation or mission requirements surpass available capabilities. Current guidelines recommend a 7- to 10-day course of ertapenem or moxifloxacin, with vancomycin if methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, for all penetrating trauma in PCC. Data from civilian and military trauma have demonstrated benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis in multiple types of penetrating trauma, but the recommended regimens and durations differ from those used in PCC, with the PCC guidelines generally recommending broader coverage. We present a review of the available civilian and military literature on antibiotic prophylaxis in penetrating trauma to discuss whether a strategy of broader coverage is necessary in the PCC setting, with the goal of optimizing patient outcomes and antibiotic stewardship, while remaining cognizant of the challenges of moving medical material to and through combat zones. Empiric extended gram-negative coverage is unlikely to be necessary for thoracic, maxillofacial, extremity, and central nervous system trauma in most medical settings. However, providing the narrowest appropriate antimicrobial coverage is challenging in PCC because of limited resources, most notably, delay to surgical debridement. Antibiotic prophylaxis regimen must be determined on a case-by-case basis based on individual patient factors while still considering antibiotic stewardship. Narrower regimens, which focus on matching up the site of infection to the antibiotic chosen, may be appropriate based on available resources and expertise of treating providers. When resources permit in PCC, the narrower cefazolin-based regimens (with the addition of metronidazole for esophageal or abdominal involvement, or gross contamination of central nervous system trauma) likely provide adequate coverage. Levofloxacin is appropriate for ocular trauma. Ideally, cefazolin and metronidazole should be carried by medics in addition to first-line antibiotics (moxifloxacin and ertapenem, Literature Synthesis and Expert Opinion; Level V).

### Primary reconstruction of open depressed skull fractures with titanium mesh [^1174P8KE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Open skull fractures have been traditionally managed in 2 stages: urgent craniotomy and elevation of the fracture with removal of contaminated bone, debridement, and delayed cranioplasty. Primary, single-stage repair of these injures has been said to entail risks such as infections. Recent experience, however, disproved these concerns. We used a primary single-stage reconstruction for patients presenting with open depressed skull fractures. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. The patients underwent elevation of the compound fracture and craniotomy if necessary. Debridement was performed, followed by skull reconstruction using a 0.6-mm titanium mesh. We present 5 consecutive male patients (age, 32.2 ± 15.6 years) who underwent primary reconstruction of open depressed skull fractures. Clinical and radiologic follow-up was performed 2 months after surgery. The duration of the surgery was 2 ± 1.6 hours. The size of the implanted mesh was 13 ± 13.1 cm. No infection was detected in our series, with a follow-up period of 22 ± 6.5 months (range, 16–29 months). The cosmetic result was defined in 4 patients as "excellent" and in 1 patient as "good". Primary reconstruction of open skull fractures with titanium mesh is feasible, safe, and cosmetically preferable than the conventional staged approach. The introduction into clinical practice can be warranted.

### Antibiotic duration and outcome complications for surgical site infection prevention in traumatic mandible fracture [^111vQEg1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for surgical site infection (SSI) prevention in traumatic mandibular fracture repair is unknown, and practices vary significantly. The objective of this study was to characterize antibiotic duration and outcomes after surgical repair of traumatic mandibular fracture.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective analysis of all adult patients who underwent surgical fixation of a mandible fracture between January 2014 and December 2016 was performed. Operative service was categorized between otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat surgery), plastic and reconstructive surgery, and oral and maxillofacial services. Primary outcomes were SSI and operative complications (including osteomyelitis, nonunion, malocclusion, and hardware infections). Differences in antibiotic prescription pattern were analyzed using analysis of variance test and Pearson chi-squared test.

Results

A total of 75 patients were included in the study with 33 (44.0%), 26 (34.7%), and 16 (21.3%) managed by plastic and reconstructive surgery, ear, nose, and throat surgery, and oral and maxillofacial services, respectively. Median age was 30.0 y. Median injury severity score was 4.0. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay (P = 0.44), intensive care unit length of stay (P = 0.53), or postoperative complications (P = 0.15). None of our patients developed an SSI or postantibiotics complications. Although the total inpatient duration of antibiotics was not significantly different among services (P = 0.37), there were significant differences in outpatient duration of antibiotics (P = 0.007) and total duration of antibiotics (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Duration of antibiotics is not associated with postoperative SSI or antibiotics-related complications. The wide variation in prescribing practices and lack of any clear benefit for prolonged antibiotics provides an opportunity to explore the benefits of a standardized short course of antibiotics.

### The effect of duration of antibiotic prophylaxis on infections following open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fractures: a prospective randomized clinical trial [^115dvX8F]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the benefits of a long-term prophylactic antibiotic regimen following treatment of fractured mandibles with open reduction and internal fixation.

Material and Methods

A prospective, randomized controlled trial was undertaken at Wits Oral Health Centre. Patients with mandibular fractures who were managed with open reduction and internal fixation using miniplates were randomized into 2 groups. The control group, the perioperative antibiotic (POA) group, was composed of patients who received intravenous (IV) antibiotic cover intraoperatively and a further 3 IV doses 24 hours postoperatively. The study group, the extended postoperative antibiotic (EPOA), was composed of patients who received similar doses as the control group but with an additional 5 days of oral antibiotics upon discharge. The patients were then evaluated for evidence of infection 1, 4, and 6 weeks postoperatively.

Results

A total of 77 patients were included in the study, 41 in the POA and 36 in the EPOA groups. Fourteen patients had evidence of infection noted within the 6-week follow-up period (10 in the POA and 4 in the EPOA groups). Statistical analysis with the Pearson Chi-square and Student t test showed no statistically significant difference (P = 0.399) between POA and EPOA groups. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to site and etiology of fracture, duration of operation, and presence of infection (P > 0.05) during the 6-week review period.

Conclusions

The extended use of antibiotic prophylaxis when managing mandibular fractures with open reduction and internal fixation offers no additional benefit in reducing postoperative infections.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111DuJ7Z]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, the concept of shorter antibiotic treatments for bloodstream infections has gained traction. Advances in diagnostic modalities, such as rapid molecular diagnostic tests that can identify the causative pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile more quickly, have provided a rationale for potentially shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy. Shorter courses may also reduce the overall antibiotic burden on the patient, minimizing the risk of adverse events and the development of antibiotic resistance.

Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of shorter antibiotic courses for bacterial bloodstream infections. A meta-analysis of 2865 patients reported no significant differences in 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure rates, or 90-day relapse rates between shorter-course (≤ 10 days) and longer-course (> 10 days) antibiotic treatments for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. A recent multicenter, noninferiority randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3608 hospitalized patients with bloodstream infections reported that 7 days of antibiotic therapy was noninferior to 14 days in terms of 90-day all-cause mortality (difference, −1.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −4 to 0.8). However, the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections remains a subject of intense debate. There is a lack of clear and definitive guidelines, and clinical practice varies widely. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare shorter versus longer-term antibiotic treatments for patients with bacterial bloodstream infections.

### Factors associated with delays in medical and surgical open facial fracture management [^114vMuuy]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Open fractures are at risk of infection because of exposure of bone and tissue to the environment. Facial fractures are often accompanied by other severe injuries, and therefore fracture management may be delayed until after stabilization. Previous studies in this area have examined timing of multiple facets of care but have tended to report on each in isolation (eg, antibiotic initiation).

Methods

This was a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to five trauma centers from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021 with open facial fractures. Variables collected included demographics, injury mechanism, details on facial and non-facial injuries, facial fracture management (irrigation and debridement (I&D), irrigation without debridement, open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), antibiotics), and other hospital events. The study hypothesized that the presence of serious non-facial injuries would be associated with delays in facial fracture management. The primary aims were to describe open facial fracture management practices and examine factors associated with early versus delayed fracture management. A secondary aim was to describe infection rates. Early treatment was defined as within 24 hours of arrival for I&D, irrigation without debridement, and ORIF and within 1 hour for antibiotics.

Results

A total of 256 patients were included. Twenty-seven percent had major trauma (Injury Severity Score ≥ 16). The presence of serious head injury/traumatic brain injury was associated with delayed I&D (OR early = 0.04, p < 0.01), irrigation without debridement (OR early = 0.09, p < 0.01), and ORIF (OR early = 0.10, p < 0.01). Going to the OR within 24 hours was associated with early I&D (OR early = 377.26, p < 0.01), irrigation without debridement (OR early = 13.54, p < 0.01), and ORIF (OR early = 154.92, p < 0.01). The infection rate was 4%.

Conclusions

In this examination of multiple aspects of open facial fracture management, serious injuries to non-facial regions led to delays in surgical fracture management, consistent with the study hypothesis.

### Severe destructive nasopharyngeal granulomatosis with polyangiitis with superimposed skull baseosteomyelitis [^117BS4M5]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The primary treatment of osteomyelitis is surgical debridement and irrigation. Long-term antibiotic therapy is the traditional adjunctive treatment, and the standard recommendation for treating chronic osteomyelitis is 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotics. However, the optimal duration of therapy remains uncertain. For chronic skull base osteomyelitis, some published literature suggests to continue antibiotics for up to 6 months, much longer than usual for odontogenic infections.

There is a paucity of case reports of associations between vasculitides and osteomyelitis. Table 1 highlights the published case reports within the past 20 years. A literature review was completed with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search terms of 'vasculitis' and 'osteomyelitis' using PubMed search engine.

Table 1
Case reports of vasculitis associated with osteomyelitis

A recent case report by Harrison et al highlighted in the above table, identifies the importance of recognising that nasopharyngeal GPA can mimic skull base osteomyelitis. Our case is an important complementary follow-up to ensure clinicians are aware of the potential of a superimposed infectious pathology, and the need to exclude osteomyelitis before empirically treating a vasculitis with immunosuppression prior to completion of an appropriate antibiotic course. Immunosuppression has been identified as a risk factor for early death in skull base osteomyelitis.

To our knowledge, this is the first case report of skull base osteomyelitis superimposed on chronic nasopharyngeal GPA. This case highlights the importance of investigating GPA or other associated vasculitides in the setting of skull base osteomyelitis as it will change the therapeutic approach and outcomes in our patients.

Learning points

Clinicians should have a high suspicion of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or other associated vasculitides with chronic destructive sinus disease, even with normal or equivocal antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.
Destructive nasopharyngeal GPA can lead to superinfection with osteomyelitis.
Prompt diagnosis is crucial to prevent severe morbidity in destructive nasopharyngeal GPA and skull base osteomyelitis.
It is essential to exclude underlying infection before initiating empiric immunosuppression for GPA.

### Duration of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in facial fractures… [^116JXcMH]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Duration of Postoperative Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Facial FracturesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Facial fractures make up a significant proportion of injuries in trauma patients. Treatment of these fractures often results in standard surgical interventions. While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its efficacy is well accepted today. Chole and his team could show that the administration of antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight hours after the intervention reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42, 2% to 8. 9%. In addition some authors assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics might increase the risk of infectious complications via superinfection. On the other hand a short term or single shot administration might not be enough to prevent the onset of an postoperative infection.

Up to date there is no standard to support the administration of antibiotics after surgical repair of a facial fracture. The purpose of this prospective, randomized double-blinded trial is to investigate the utility of antibiotics administered in the postoperative period after surgical revision of facial fractures. Hypothesis: a short-term antibiotic prophylaxis of 1 day postoperatively is equally effective as a long-term administration of 5 days in facial fractures. Background While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial its efficacy is well accepted today. Chole et al. showed that the administration of antibiotics reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42, 2% to 8. 9%. Some studies compared a 12 or 24 hour with a 5 day postoperative regime: Johnson et al. conducted a study with one hundred nine patients requiring pedicled flap reconstruction in the region of the head and neck.

He investigated if 5 days of antibiotic administration would be more effective than 1 day and concluded that no beneficial effect from administration of antibiotics for longer than 24 hours postoperatively can be achieved in patients who undergo myocutaneous flap reconstruction. Abubaker et al. evaluated the difference between the effect of a 5-day postoperative course and a 12 hour administration of antibiotics in 30 Patients on the incidence of postoperative infection in uncomplicated fractures of the mandible. He concluded that a prolonged administration of antibiotics has no benefit in reducing the incidence of infections. Objective Aim of this study is to evaluate the difference between the effect of a five- vs. a one-day postoperative course of antibiotics on the incidence of postoperative infections in facial fractures.

### Timing of antibiotic administration, wound debridement, and the stages of reconstructive surgery for open long bone fractures of the upper and lower limbs [^11373g2Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Open fractures of the major long bones are complex limb-threatening injuries that are predisposed to deep infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgery to debride the wound, stabilise the fracture and reconstruct any soft tissue defect to enable infection-free bone repair. There is a need to assess the effect of timing and duration of antibiotic administration and timing and staging of surgical interventions to optimise outcomes.

To assess the effects (risks and benefits) of the timing of antibiotic administration, wound debridement and the stages of surgical interventions in managing people with open long bone fractures of the upper and lower limbs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registers in February 2021. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that recruited adults with open fractures of the major long bones, comparing: 1) timings of prophylactic antibiotic treatment, 2) duration of prophylactic antibiotic treatment, 3) timing of wound debridement following injury or 4) timing of the stages of reconstructive surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We aimed to collect data for the following outcomes: limb function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), deep surgical site infection, delayed or non-union, adverse events (in the short- and long-term course of recovery), and resource-related outcomes.

Main Results

We included three RCTs of 613 randomised participants with 617 open fractures. Studies were conducted in medical and trauma centres in the USA and Kenya. Where reported, there was a higher proportion of men and a mean age of participants between 30 and 34 years old. Fractures were in the upper and lower limbs in one study, and were tibia fractures in two studies; where reported, these were the result of high-energy trauma such as road traffic accidents. No studies compared the timing of antibiotic treatment or wound debridement. Duration of prophylactic antibiotic treatment (1 study, 77 participants available for analysis) One study compared antibiotic treatment for 24 hours with antibiotic treatment for five days. We are very uncertain about the effects of different durations of antibiotic treatment on superficial infections (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.87, favours 5 day treatment; 1 study, 77 participants); this was very low-certainty evidence derived from one small study with unclear and high risks of bias, and with an imprecise effect estimate. This study reported no other review outcomes. Reconstructive surgery: timing of the stages of surgery (2 studies, 458 participants available for analysis) Two studies compared the timing of wound closure, which was completed immediately or delayed. In one study, the mean time of delay was 5.9 days; in the other study, the time of delay was not reported. We are very uncertain about the effects of different timings of wound closure on deep infections (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.80, favours immediate closure; 2 studies, 458 participants), delayed union or non-union (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.55, favours delayed closure; 1 study, 387 participants), or superficial infections (RR 6.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 120.43, favours delayed closure; 1 study, 71 participants); this was very low-certainty evidence. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for very serious risks of bias because both studies had unclear and high risks of bias. We also downgraded for serious imprecision because effect estimates were imprecise, including the possibility of benefits as well as harms, and very serious imprecision when the data were derived from single small study. These studies reported no other review outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We could not determine the risks and benefits of different treatment protocols for open long bone fractures because the evidence was very uncertain for the two comparisons and we did not find any studies addressing the other possible comparisons. Well-designed randomised trials with adequate power are needed to guide surgical and antibiotic treatment of open fractures, particularly with regard to timing and duration of antibiotic administration and timing and staging of surgery.

### Single-versus multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical treatment of closed fractures: a meta-analysis [^1136STSG]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the surgical treatment of closed long bone fractures is well established. The duration and dosage of prophylaxis, however, vary significantly among surgeons. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine if multiple-dose perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is more effective than a single preoperative dose in the prevention of surgical wound infections during the treatment of closed long bone fractures.

Data Sources

Articles were identified by searching the following medical databases: Medline, Medline In Process & Other Non-indexed Citations, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Relevant conference proceedings and the reference section of selected manuscripts were also searched for additional studies.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they were prospective randomized controlled trials of patients with closed fractures treated with surgical fixation or arthroplasty. The interventions must have directly compared a single preoperative prophylactic dose to a multiple-dose perioperative strategy. Studies were excluded if they involved open fractures.

Data Extraction

The demographic information, prophylaxis strategy, wound infection rate, and risk ratio were extracted from each article.

Data Synthesis

Seven trials and 3,808 patients were pooled using a random effects model. When compared to a regimen of multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics, administration of a single preoperative dose has a risk ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 0.60–2.60). The pooled risk difference between the 2 strategies is 0.005 (95% CI -0.011–0.021). Neither result is significant.

Conclusions

In the setting of closed long bone fractures, the pooled results failed to demonstrate superiority of multiple-dose prophylaxis over a single-dose strategy. The pooled estimates suggest that surgical wound infections are relatively rare events and that any potential difference in infection rates between prophylaxis strategies is likely quite small. However, because the confidence interval surrounding the pooled risk ratio spans 1.0 by such a large amount, we are unable to definitively recommend a preferred dosing regimen to prevent surgical wound infections. Although future research is required to ensure our prophylaxis decisions continue to be evidence based and cost-effective, it is unlikely that a single clinical trial will be able to provide the answer. The use of other quantitative methods, such as cost-effectiveness analysis, may be helpful in modeling an optimal prophylaxis strategy.

### Antibiotics in the treatment of low-velocity gunshot-induced fractures: a systematic literature review [^116VBhBr]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Low-velocity gunshots are often associated with extremity fractures. There is no consensus, however, on the use of antibiotics for these injuries.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a literature review to answer the following questions: (1) Are antibiotics needed for the treatment of these fractures? (2) Is gram-negative coverage necessary? (3) How long should antibiotics be administered? And (4) which is the optimal administration route?

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE(®) search and found only two relevant prospective, randomized studies. Further searches identified all case series with information on the use of antibiotics in gunshot fractures. In total, 33 studies provided enough data to answer the study questions. An assessment of the quality of the identified studies was performed. Twenty-three studies met at least ½ of the quality items of the assessment tool.

Results

Antibiotics did not significantly reduce the infection rate for fractures treated nonoperatively (1.7% with antibiotics versus 5.1% without) with the numbers available. There was no significant difference in infection rates when gram-negative coverage was added, either in nonoperatively treated fractures (1.7% versus 2.8%) or in operatively treated fractures (0% versus 2.5%). Duration of antibiotic administration did not significantly affect the infection rate. No difference was found between intravenous and oral antibiotic administration for nonoperatively treated fractures.

Conclusions

This literature review could not demonstrate a significant benefit with the use of antibiotics for low-velocity gunshot fractures treated nonoperatively; however, the statistical power for these comparisons was low in the available literature, which is insufficiently strong to recommend a treatment. Gram-negative coverage did not alter the infection rates in gunshot fractures, nor did longer duration of antibiotic administration. For fractures treated nonoperatively, oral antibiotics are as efficacious as intravenous antibiotics.

Abstract

Trauma is a complex disease, and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in trauma patients is common practice. However, considering the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, AP use should be questioned and limited only to specific cases. Antibiotic stewardship is of paramount importance in fighting resistance spread. Definitive rules or precise indications about AP in trauma remain unclear. The present article describes the indications of AP in traumatic lesions to the head, brain, torso, maxillofacial, extremities, skin, and soft tissues endorsed by the Global Alliance for Infection in Surgery, Surgical Infection Society Europe, World Surgical Infection Society, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, and World Society of Emergency Surgery.
