## Question

What is the management of HBSAG positive pregnant women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of HBsAg-positive pregnant women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about universal screening and confirmation. Then, I should verify the initial maternal evaluation and risk stratification. Next, I will consider antepartum monitoring and when to start antiviral therapy. After that, I need to check intrapartum and postpartum management, including breastfeeding. Finally, I will review infant prophylaxis, postvaccination serologic testing, and long-term maternal follow-up, while highlighting implementation gaps and quality improvements.

> Let me first confirm the screening strategy, because missing this step undermines everything downstream. Universal screening for HBsAg is recommended at the first prenatal visit for every pregnancy, regardless of prior vaccination or testing history, and if status is unknown at admission, testing should be repeated with expedited processing to enable timely infant prophylaxis [^1116iexN] [^114MCmaQ] [^112fFq6t]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance: some guidance emphasizes first trimester, but the core principle is early prenatal screening; if missed, test at admission and use rapid pathways to protect the infant [^1116iexN] [^114MCmaQ].

> I need to ensure confirmatory testing is not overlooked. Initially reactive HBsAg results should be confirmed with a licensed neutralizing assay to avoid false positives, and the laboratory should be instructed to report pregnancy status to facilitate public health case management and linkage to perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs [^115aCNSP] [^112fFq6t]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even if the patient was previously vaccinated; yes, screening is still indicated each pregnancy because prior vaccination does not guarantee current infection status or negate perinatal risk [^1116iexN] [^114MCmaQ].

> Next, I should review the initial maternal evaluation to distinguish acute from chronic infection and quantify transmission risk. I will now examine the recommended labs: quantitative HBV DNA, HBeAg, ALT, and total anti-HBc with IgM anti-HBc if acute infection is suspected; this helps stage disease and guide therapy decisions [^111zXcPR] [^115wdFHG]. Let me consider the risk gradient: without prophylaxis, MTCT risk is about 5–20% in HBeAg-negative mothers and 70–90% in HBeAg-positive mothers, and high maternal HBV DNA is the strongest predictor of immunoprophylaxis failure, which is why viral load thresholds drive antiviral decisions [^116RTRUL] [^114ugdgF].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence during pregnancy. ALT should be checked at least each trimester to detect flares, and HBV DNA should be reassessed in the third trimester, ideally around 28–32 weeks, to decide on antiviral prophylaxis; this timing balances efficacy and safety for mother and infant [^115wdFHG] [^116snB5r]. But wait, what if the patient is already on therapy? If already on a nucleos(t)ide analogue, continue it; if on entecavir, switch to TDF or TAF for pregnancy and breastfeeding due to better safety data [^115wdFHG].

> Now, I will examine the antiviral prophylaxis threshold and agent selection. I should confirm that antiviral therapy to prevent MTCT is recommended when HBV DNA is greater than 200,000 IU/mL, typically initiated at 28–32 weeks and continued until delivery or up to 3 months postpartum, with TDF preferred and TAF as an alternative; entecavir should be avoided in pregnancy if possible [^115wdFHG] [^115wdFHG]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence; AASLD/IDSA gives this a strong recommendation with moderate certainty, reflecting robust observational and randomized data showing substantial reductions in MTCT with third-trimester antivirals [^115wdFHG].

> Let me think about special situations and counseling. Invasive procedures such as amniocentesis increase MTCT risk when HBV DNA is high, so I should discuss this explicitly and consider antiviral prophylaxis earlier if such procedures are planned; cesarean delivery is not indicated solely to reduce MTCT, and breastfeeding is not contraindicated when infants receive standard prophylaxis [^1156taQ8] [^116k6SWc] [^113fEcbq] [^114d7grq]. I should confirm that patients are counseled on partner and household screening and vaccination, and that they understand the chronic nature of HBV and the need for longitudinal care [^1114fK81] [^1144Dzqw].

> Next, I should review intrapartum and immediate postpartum care. I need to ensure the delivery hospital has a copy of the original HBsAg-positive lab report to avoid transcription errors and to trigger automatic infant prophylaxis protocols; this is a critical systems step that reduces missed prophylaxis [^115aCNSP] [^112fFq6t]. Let me reconsider postpartum flares: ALT should be checked at 6–12 weeks postpartum and periodically thereafter, as immunologic rebound can precipitate flares, especially if antivirals are stopped at delivery [^114d7grq].

> I will now examine infant prophylaxis, because this is the cornerstone of prevention. All infants of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBIG and the first dose of HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth at separate injection sites, followed by completion of the series and postvaccination serologic testing at 9–12 months to document protection or detect breakthrough infection; if maternal status is unknown, give vaccine within 12 hours and add HBIG as soon as possible if the mother is found positive [^115h4ecn] [^115aggHK] [^113hYXrY]. Wait, I should verify low-birth-weight nuances: for infants under 2,000 grams, the birth dose does not count toward the 3-dose series, so a total of 4 doses are needed, with the final dose not before 24 weeks of age [^114RfHtp].

> Let me verify the long-term maternal plan, because pregnancy is a window to engage chronic care. After delivery, HBV DNA and ALT should be monitored every 3 months for 6 months if antivirals were discontinued, and ongoing chronic HBV management should continue with periodic ALT, HBV DNA, HBeAg/anti-HBe, and liver ultrasound for fibrosis assessment; treatment indications revert to standard adult criteria outside pregnancy [^114d7grq] [^113jHG7S]. I should confirm that patients are linked to hepatology or primary care for longitudinal management and HCC surveillance when indicated [^113jHG7S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about implementation without acknowledging gaps. Real-world data show that 12–18% of pregnant patients still do not get screened, fewer than half of HBsAg-positive patients receive HBV DNA testing, and antiviral therapy is underused, with marked racial and educational disparities; these gaps translate into ongoing perinatal infections that are preventable [^114MCmaQ] [^114smffL] [^114VoWsM]. I should double-check that obstetrician surveys reveal knowledge and systems failures, including low rates of providing lab copies to delivery hospitals and incomplete counseling, reinforcing the need for standardized algorithms and EHR prompts [^115iso4Z] [^111pkEMu].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is actionable and reference-aligned. The management of HBsAg-positive pregnancy hinges on five pillars: universal early screening with confirmation, comprehensive maternal staging with HBV DNA and ALT, third-trimester antiviral prophylaxis when HBV DNA exceeds 200,000 IU/mL, coordinated perinatal care with documented communication to the delivery site, and infant prophylaxis with HBIG plus vaccine within 12 hours followed by PVST; this approach reduces MTCT from roughly 10–30% without prophylaxis to less than 1–2% when fully implemented [^115wdFHG] [^114RfHtp] [^117SGayu]. Let me reconsider any lingering uncertainties: if HBV DNA is not available, some guidelines allow empiric TDF prophylaxis in high-prevalence settings or when HBeAg is positive, but in U.S. practice, prioritizing access to HBV DNA testing remains the standard to avoid overtreatment and to optimize timing [^115E1cAj] [^115wdFHG].

Management of HBsAg-positive pregnant women centers on **universal screening at the first prenatal visit** [^1116iexN] and **HBV DNA testing** to guide therapy [^115aCNSP]. If HBV DNA is > 200,000 IU/mL, start **tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)** from 28–32 weeks until delivery or up to 3 months postpartum to reduce perinatal transmission [^115wdFHG] [^114d7grq]. All infants must receive **HBIG and the first HepB vaccine dose within 12 hours** of birth, complete the series, and have post-vaccination serology at 9–12 months [^114RfHtp] [^115aggHK]. Monitor ALT and HBV DNA during pregnancy and postpartum, and coordinate care with hepatology and pediatrics [^114d7grq] [^115aCNSP].

---

## Screening and diagnosis

- **Universal screening**: Screen all pregnant patients for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit, regardless of prior testing or vaccination [^1116iexN] [^114MCmaQ].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Confirm positive HBsAg with a neutralizing assay and test for HBV DNA, HBeAg, and ALT to define infection phase and transmission risk [^115aCNSP] [^111zXcPR].

- **Repeat screening**: If the initial test is negative but risk factors persist, repeat in the third trimester or at delivery [^113Vqv35] [^1116iexN].

---

## Maternal antepartum management

- **Monitoring**: Check ALT and HBV DNA each trimester; monitor more often if abnormal or if antiviral therapy is used [^114d7grq] [^116snB5r].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Initiate TDF at 28–32 weeks if HBV DNA > 200,000 IU/mL; continue until delivery or up to 3 months postpartum, then stop if no ongoing indication [^115wdFHG] [^114d7grq].

- **Alternative therapy**: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is acceptable if TDF is unavailable or contraindicated, but TDF is preferred [^115wdFHG] [^114d7grq].

- **Counseling**: Discuss MTCT risks, infant prophylaxis, and breastfeeding safety with antivirals [^114d7grq] [^115aCNSP].

---

## Intrapartum and postpartum management

Intrapartum care should avoid **cesarean delivery solely for HBV**; manage delivery as obstetrically indicated [^113fEcbq] [^111EHjCQ]. Postpartum, monitor ALT and HBV DNA for 6 months after delivery or stopping antivirals to detect flares, and continue TDF/TAF if there is an ongoing indication such as active disease or cirrhosis [^114d7grq] [^115wdFHG].

---

## Infant prophylaxis and follow-up

- **Birth prophylaxis**: Give HBIG and the first HepB vaccine dose within 12 hours of birth at separate sites [^114RfHtp] [^115aggHK].

- **Vaccine series**: Complete the standard HepB series per schedule, ensuring the final dose is at ≥ 24 weeks of age [^114RfHtp] [^113hYXrY].

- **Post-vaccination testing**: Test for HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9–12 months to confirm protection or detect infection [^114RfHtp] [^115aCNSP].

- **Low birth weight**: For infants < 2,000 g, give HBIG and HepB within 12 hours, and administer 4 total doses (birth dose does not count) [^114RfHtp] [^113hYXrY].

---

## Coordination of care

Reporting to the **perinatal hepatitis B prevention program** ensures case management and infant follow-up [^115aCNSP] [^117VEwP2]. Multidisciplinary care with obstetrics, hepatology, and pediatrics supports maternal disease management and infant prophylaxis [^114d7grq] [^115aCNSP]. Patient education should cover HBV transmission, infant prophylaxis, and the need for infant follow-up [^115aCNSP] [^1144Dzqw].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Screening | Universal HBsAg screening at first prenatal visit [^1116iexN] [^114MCmaQ] |
| Confirmatory testing | HBV DNA, HBeAg, ALT [^115aCNSP] [^111zXcPR] |
| Antiviral therapy | TDF if HBV DNA > 200,000 IU/mL at 28–32 weeks [^115wdFHG] [^114d7grq] |
| Infant prophylaxis | HBIG + HepB vaccine within 12 hours [^114RfHtp] [^115aggHK] |
| Infant follow-up | Post-vaccination serology at 9–12 months [^114RfHtp] [^115aCNSP] |
| Postpartum monitoring | ALT and HBV DNA for 6 months [^114d7grq] [^115wdFHG] |

CONCLUSIONS

This study suggests that as many as half a million pregnant persons who gave birth in the U.S. each year were not tested for hepatitis B and that this could have resulted in a failure to identify as many as 1,480 HBsAg-positive pregnant persons at risk for perinatal transmission of hepatitis B each year. The study further found that less than half of the HBsAg-positive pregnant persons received HBV-directed monitoring during pregnancy. These gaps in screening and monitoring may have contributed to the estimated 950 infants who develop CHB each year in the U.S. A national strategy to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B by 2030 would need a call to action to strengthen the implementation of the existing recommendations and to introduce new healthcare providers, pregnant persons, and health systems–related strategies to improve prenatal hepatitis B screening, HBV-directed monitoring, and management of HBsAg-positive pregnant persons.

### Management of hepatitis B during pregnancy [^114ugdgF]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic HBV infection is estimated to affect > 350 million people worldwide and represents a substantial source of morbidity and mortality related to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) remains an important source of incident cases of hepatitis B. Immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen is used to prevent MTCT; however, under-utilization of this intervention in certain regions endemic for HBV infection and failure of immunoprophylaxis in 5–10% of cases are barriers to preventing HBV transmission via this route. Data suggest that a high level of HBV viraemia in pregnant women is a substantial risk factor for immunoprophylaxis failure. Potential means of reducing viral load include antiviral therapy in the third trimester to reduce exposure of the neonate to the virus. Determining the optimal time to treat active HBV-related liver disease in women who wish to become pregnant, as well as managing antiviral therapy in patients who become pregnant, remains challenging. Owing to the vulnerable population affected by these issues, clinical trials are difficult and, thus, evidence-based recommendations are limited. Emerging data are addressing management of HBV during pregnancy that health-care providers should be made aware of. Here, we provide an overview of issues pertinent to HBV infection during pregnancy and present a management algorithm.

INTRODUCTION

In the U.S. there are an estimated 860,000–2.4 million people living with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who are at risk of premature death from liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma if they are not monitored for disease progression and receive antiviral therapy when indicated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 20,678 women who gave birth in 2015 were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Pregnant women infected with HBV can transmit the infection to their newborns. Without immunoprophylaxis, as many as 90% of infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)– and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive mothers (who are generally highly viremic) and 5%–20% of infants born to HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative mothers will develop CHB. Infants who develop CHB are at the highest risk of death from liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. By CDC estimates, about 950 infants each year became chronically infected with HBV from perinatal transmission in the U.S.

Identification and Management of HBV-Infected Pregnant Women

All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (e.g. first trimester) in each pregnancy, even if they have been vaccinated or tested previously. Testing those pregnant women known to be chronically infected with HBV provides documentation of the positive HBsAg test result obtained during pregnancy and helps to ensure that their infants will be identified for timely prophylaxis. All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be tested for HBV DNA to guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal HBV transmission (new recommendation). AASLD suggests maternal antiviral therapy when the maternal HBV DNA is > 200,000 IU/mL (new recommendation). All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be referred to their jurisdiction's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) for case management to ensure that their infants receive timely prophylaxis and follow-up. A copy of the original laboratory report indicating the pregnant woman's HBsAg-positive status should be provided to the hospital or birthing facility where the delivery is planned and to the HCP who will care for the newborn infant. All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should receive information concerning HBV that discusses the potential use of antiviral therapy, the importance of prophylaxis for their infant (HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth), completion of the vaccine series, and postvaccination serologic testing.
Women not tested prenatally, those with clinical hepatitis, and those whose behaviors place them at high risk for HBV infection (e.g. recent or current injection-drug use, having had more than one sex partner in the previous 6 months or an HBsAg-positive sex partner, having been evaluated or treated for a STI) should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital or birthing facility for delivery.
All laboratories that provide HBsAg testing of pregnant women should use a Food and Drug Administration–licensed or approved HBsAg test and should perform testing according to the manufacturer's labeling, including testing of initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols may be used and initially reactive results reported to expedite administration of postexposure prophylaxis of infants. Commercial laboratories should be encouraged to capture pregnancy status for women tested for HBsAg to aid in identification of HBV-infected pregnant women.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1175uqH7]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Scope of review — The USPSTF reaffirmation targeted prevention of perinatal transmission by reviewing screening and case management. It 'commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update' 'to identify substantial new evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation'. 'Case management is the standard intervention in the United States for all HBV-positive pregnant women', and therefore the USPSTF 'targeted its evidence review to focus on the effectiveness and potential harms of screening and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission'.

### Management of hepatitis B infected pregnant women: a cross-sectional study of obstetricians [^111UXLUG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The elimination of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a pillar of the United States (U.S.) national prevention strategy to combat viral hepatitis. Infected newborns are particularly vulnerable to developing chronic HBV infection and carry a 25% risk of premature death from liver cancer and liver cirrhosis later in life. Risk of perinatal chronic HBV infection is as high as 90% if the mother is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive. A 2016 National Academy of Medicine report concluded that ending perinatal transmission of hepatitis B is highly feasible. Administration of hepatitis immune globulin and HBV vaccination within 12 h of birth and completion of the HBV vaccine series is 85–95% effective in preventing chronic HBV in newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers. Prophylactic antiviral therapy in the third trimester has also been demonstrated to further decrease perinatal chronic HBV transmission in highly viremic, HBeAg positive women.

Routine HBV screening of pregnant women has long been recommended by both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The ACIP further recommends: antenatal reporting of HBsAg-positive pregnant women to public health departments, providing a laboratory copy of the HBsAg test result to the planned delivery hospital to prevent transcription errors, post-vaccination HBV testing (PVST) for infants born to infected mothers, and appropriate counseling and referral of HBsAg-positive pregnant women for medical management.

Despite these recommendations, only half of the estimated 25,000 HBsAg-positive women that give birth each year are referred for enrollment in the perinatal HBV prevention program for case management. The percentage of infants born to HBsAg-positive women that received PVST has remained low and an estimated 800–1000 infants still become chronically infected each year.

In the U.S. 86% of women receive their prenatal care from obstetricians, providing the chance to prevent HBV transmission and optimize the health of the infected mothers. In an effort to better understand the gaps and opportunities for improvement, we surveyed obstetricians' HBV knowledge and preventative practices.

### Gaps in prenatal hepatitis B screening and management of HBsAg positive pregnant persons in the U.S., 2015–2020 [^114smffL]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). HBsAg-positive pregnant persons are recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to receive regular monitoring, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA and antiviral therapy for active hepatitis and to prevent perinatal HBV transmission if HBV DNA level is > 200,000 IU/mL.

Methods

Using Optum Clinformatics Data Mart Database claims data, pregnant women who received HBsAg testing and HBsAg-positive pregnant persons who received HBV DNA and alt testing and antiviral therapy during pregnancy and after delivery during January 1, 2015-December 31, 2020 were analyzed.

Results

Among 506,794 pregnancies, 14.6% did not receive HBsAg testing. Pregnant women more likely to receive testing for HBsAg (p < 0.01) were persons aged ≥ 20 years, were Asian, had > 1 child, or received education beyond high school. Among the 0.28% (1,437) pregnant women who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, 46% were Asian. The proportion of HBsAg-positive pregnant women who received HBV DNA testing during pregnancy and in the 12 months after delivery was 44.3% and 28.6%, respectively; the proportion that received hepatitis B e antigen was 31.6% and 12.7%, respectively; the proportion that received ALT testing was 67.4% and 47%, respectively; and the proportion that received HBV antiviral therapy was 7% and 6.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

This study suggests that as many as half a million (∼14%) pregnant persons who gave birth each year were not tested for HBsAg to prevent perinatal transmission. More than 50% of HBsAg-positive persons did not receive the recommended HBV-directed monitoring tests during pregnancy and after delivery.

### Recommendations for identification and public health management of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^117DsUc7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the primary way to identify persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Testing has been recommended previously for pregnant women, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, household contacts and sex partners of HBV-infected persons, persons born in countries with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 8%, persons who are the source of blood or body fluid exposures that might warrant postexposure prophylaxis (e.g., needlestick injury to a health-care worker or sexual assault), and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. This report updates and expands previous CDC guidelines for HBsAg testing and includes new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts. Routine testing for HBsAg now is recommended for additional populations with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%: persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%, men who have sex with men, and injection-drug users. Implementation of these recommendations will require expertise and resources to integrate HBsAg screening in prevention and care settings serving populations recommended for HBsAg testing. This report is intended to serve as a resource for public health officials, organizations, and health-care professionals involved in the development, delivery, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services.

### Gaps in prenatal hepatitis B screening and management of HBsAg positive pregnant persons in the U.S., 2015–2020 [^113SkTPL]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend universal prenatal HBsAg testing at each pregnancy to identify women infected with HBV. In 2018, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also recommended that HBsAg-positive pregnant women receive testing for HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to identify women with high viral load. Twenty-six states have laws that mandate prenatal hepatitis B testing. On the basis of claims data, CDC reported that between 2011 and 2014, 18% of commercially insured pregnant women were not tested for HBsAg and in that 2014, 12.3% of commercially insured and 16.4% of Medicaid-enrolled women who gave birth did not receive prenatal HBsAg testing.

Patients with CHB require chronic disease management, including regular monitoring for active hepatitis and progression to liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis flares with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and liver injury can occur during pregnancy and after delivery and may require antiviral therapy. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease in 2007 recommended that HBsAg-positive persons, including pregnant women, receive CHB disease evaluation and monitoring, including testing for ALT, HBeAg, and HBV DNA, and HBV antiviral therapy for those with active hepatitis. In 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease further recommended antiviral therapy to prevent perinatal HBV transmission if HBV DNA is over 200,000 IU/mL. Harris et al.found that among the pregnant women between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2014, only 42% of the HBsAg-positive women during pregnancy and 39% after delivery received claims for HBV-directed monitoring tests defined as ALT and HBV DNA or HBeAg; 13% received claims for antiviral therapy during pregnancy but only 1.6% after delivery.

The goal of this study is to assess whether since 2014, there has been an increase in HBsAg testing among pregnant persons with commercial insurance on the basis of claims data and the proportion of HBsAg-positive persons who received HBV DNA, HBeAg, ALT testing, and antiviral therapy during pregnancy and in the first 12 months after delivery. Multiple factors were analyzed to identify gaps and disparities to improve HBsAg screening and CHB management among pregnant persons.

### Gaps in prenatal hepatitis B screening and management of HBsAg positive pregnant persons in the U.S., 2015–2020 [^1162X4ZN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There were 1,437 of 506,794 (0.28%) unique pregnancies (1,309 unique persons) with at least 1 CHB diagnosis before delivery. The majority (98.8%) of the HBsAg-positive pregnancies were aged ≥ 20 years, and 92.8% had > 1 child (Appendix Table 8, available online). Among the HBsAg-positive pregnant women, 46.0% were Asian, 29.1% were White, 12.9% were Black, and 9.1% were Hispanic; 35.1% had a bachelor's or postgraduate degree; and 47.3% had postsecondary education but less than bachelor's degree.

Among the 1,437 unique pregnancies with CHB diagnosis, 637 (44.3%) had claims for ≥ 1 HBV DNA (27.4% had claims for both HBV DNA and HBeAg, 17% had claims for HBV DNA only), and 4.3% had claims for HBeAg only during pregnancy. The proportion with claims for ≥ 1 HBV DNA test during pregnancy increased from 36.7% to 52% between 2015 and 2017 (p < 0.01) but dropped back to 40.7% in 2018 and 46.5% in 2019 (Figure 2 and Appendix Table 9, available online). A total of 969 (67.4%) pregnancies with CHB had claims for ≥ 1 ALT test. The proportion with claims for ≥ 1 ALT test during pregnancy increased from 59.7% to 70.4% (p < 0.01) between 2015 and 2017 but remained at 70% in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 2 and Appendix Table 9, available online).

Background:

The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and testing HBsAg–positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). HBsAg–positive pregnant persons are recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to receive regular monitoring, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA and antiviral therapy for active hepatitis and to prevent perinatal HBV transmission if HBV DNA level is > 200,000 IU/mL.

DISCUSSION

In this study of persons aged 15–50 years with commercial insurance enrolled in the Optum database who gave birth between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019, about 15% of the pregnancies did not receive a hepatitis B test. Among the pregnancies who received testing between 2015 and 2019, the prevalence of HBsAg was 0.28%. Asian persons accounted for almost half of HBsAg-positive pregnancies, although Asian persons only comprised 8.4% of the pregnancies between 2015 and 2019. The disproportionately high proportion of Asian persons who were HBsAg positive is consistent with the high prevalence of CHB in the Asian community. Consistent with the high national and global hepatitis B vaccination coverage in children and adolescents, persons aged < 20 years accounted for only 0.2% of HBsAg-positive pregnancies.

Elimination of perinatal hepatitis B is a pillar of the U.S. national strategy to eliminate hepatitis B by 2030. In this study, the proportion of pregnant women who were not tested for HBsAg each year (~15%) has not declined between 2015 and 2019. Compared with the CDC reports that 12.3%–18% of pregnant women on commercial insurance in 2011–2014 and 16.4% on Medicaid in 2014 were not tested for hepatitis B, this study suggests that there has likely been little or no improvement to close the gap in prenatal hepatitis B testing in the U.S. in the last decade. With an estimated 3.65 million births annually and 0.28% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant persons in the U.S. if the prenatal HBsAg testing rate remains at 85.5%, it would suggest that as many as half a million pregnancies each year would not receive HBsAg testing, resulting in a failure to identify as many as 1,480 HBsAg-positive pregnant persons at risk for perinatal transmission each year.

In this study, HBsAg-positive persons who were less likely to have received testing for ALT and HBV DNA or HBeAg during pregnancy were White and Hispanic, were first-time mothers, or had less than a 12th-grade education.

CHB is a chronic liver disease that requires long-term monitoring to assess disease activity and the need for antiviral therapy. - In this study, more than 50% of the pregnant persons with CHB diagnosis did not receive the recommended monitoring tests after pregnancy. In 2019, only 46.6% received testing for ALT, 25.8% received testing for HBV DNA, and 11.7% received testing for HBeAg within 12 months after delivery (Appendix Figure 2, available online and Appendix Table 9, available online).

Strategies to increase HBV-directed testing and management during pregnancy should include increased efforts to provide all the perinatal providers (including doctors and nurses) with an easy-to-follow algorithm for testing and referral for HBV-directed care. The publication of the CDC/ACOG Screening and Referral Algorithm for hepatitis B Among Pregnant Women in 2015 may have contributed to the increased ALT and HBV DNA testing rate between 2015 and 2017. Prenatal care providers should also provide their HBsAg-positive pregnant persons culturally and linguistically appropriate educational information about CHB facts, prevention, monitoring, and treatment. This is particularly pertinent because some of them may only become aware of their infection through prenatal testing and are not aware of the risks of CHB and the benefits of disease monitoring and treatment. Chao and colleaguesfound in a survey of 138 practicing obstetricians in a CHB high-prevalence county in California, that only 60.9% routinely advised HBsAg-positive pregnant women to seek specialist evaluation for monitoring and antiviral treatment and that only 48.6% routinely provided them with CHB information. Expanding the role of the CDC-funded Perinatal hepatitis B Prevention Program would also help to ensure that HBsAg-positive pregnant persons receive the recommended testing and management.

To address the stalled screening rates, several recommendations should be considered. Health plans and providers' professional organizations, including ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), should also recommend that prenatal care providers use obstetrics/prenatal panels that included the HBsAg test. CDC should work with the electronic health records industry to build clinical decision support tools for prenatal HBsAg testing and reflex testing for HBV DNA, HBeAg, and ALT for HBsAg-positive persons to improve HBV-directed testing during pregnancy and after delivery. CDC should recommend the National Committee for Quality Assurance to adopt a measure to monitor compliance with prenatal HBsAg testing and include the new measure in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, which is used to compare the performance and quality of health plans. States should mandate prenatal hepatitis B testing (beyond the current 26 states) as part of the national strategy to improve the national screening rate.

Testing for HBV DNA in HBsAg-positive pregnancies would identify persons with high viral load who are recommended to receive antiviral therapy to prevent perinatal transmission. In this study, only 44.3% of HBsAg-positive pregnancies had claims for HBV DNA testing. HBV DNA testing increased from 35.5% in 2015 to 51.9% in 2017 but dropped back to 40.7% in 2018 and 46.5% in 2019 (Figure 2 and Appendix Table 9, available online).

Monitoring of ALT during pregnancy and after delivery is important to detect ALT flares that may require antiviral therapy. In this study, about 30% of the HBsAg-positive pregnancies did not receive ALT testing. ALT testing during pregnancy increased from 59.7% in 2015 to 70.4% in 2017 but remained at 70% in 2018 and 2019. In a multicenter retrospective analysis of two community gastroenterology clinics and two tertiary medical centers in the U.S. 6% of women during pregnancy and 10% of women within the first three months after delivery developed ALT flares. All the ALT flares during pregnancy were reported as severe with ALT > 10 × upper limit of normal, including one woman who developed hepatic decompensation at 33 weeks of gestation. Among the women with ALT flare during pregnancy, 50% required antiviral therapy.

RESULTS

A total of 625,689 unique pregnancies (565,858 unique pregnant persons) were enrolled in the Optum database between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 (Appendix Figure 1, available online). Among the 506,794 pregnancies (459,125 unique pregnant persons) in continuous enrollment at least 42 weeks before delivery, the median age was 31 years; 93.8% were aged 20–39 years, 65.9% were White, 14.6% were Hispanic, 9.3% were Black, and 8.4% were Asian. Most of them (88.8%) had at least one child before their pregnancies between 2015 and 2019 (Appendix Figure 1, available online, Appendix Table 7, available online).

Of 506,794 pregnancies that were in continuous enrollment at least 42 weeks before delivery, there were 432,607 (85.4%) who had at least one claim for HBsAg test during pregnancy (Appendix Figure 1, available online). The percentage of pregnancies that had HBsAg testing each year ranged from 84.4% to 86.1% during the study years 2015–2019 (Figure 1).

The prenatal testing rate for HBsAg among pregnant persons varied by age group, ethnicity, education level, and number of children. Multivariable regression analysis showed that pregnant persons aged ≥ 20 years, with an educational level beyond a high-school diploma, who were Asian, and who had one or more children were significantly more likely (p < 0.01) to receive HBsAg testing (Table 1).

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111F4sTk]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — Perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention in pregnancy and newborns includes maternal screening and case management plus infant prophylaxis with specific timings. Interventions include 'vaccinating infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers within 24 hours of birth' and 'completing the HBV vaccination series in infants by age 18 months'. For HBsAg-positive mothers, case management 'includes HBV DNA viral load testing and referral to specialty care', and for infants of mothers who test positive, guidelines include 'HBV vaccination and HBIG prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth' plus completing the vaccine series and 'serologic testing for infection and immunity at age 9 to 12 months'. For infants of mothers with 'unknown HBsAg status', guidelines include 'HBV vaccination within 12 hours of birth, followed by HBIG prophylaxis'. Emerging evidence states that administering 'tenofovir to HBV-positive women with acute infection significantly reduces the risk of HBsAg seropositivity in infants when combined with HBIG prophylaxis at birth and HBV vaccination', and 'as a result, recent guidelines recommend testing for viral load, antiviral treatment, and HBV vaccination and HBIG prophylaxis'.

### Management of hepatitis B infected pregnant women: a cross-sectional study of obstetricians [^112cuwtt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our survey of practicing obstetricians identified gaps in patient education, case reporting, referral for HBV treatment, and disease monitoring among HBV infected pregnant women. These gaps can have lifelong consequence for mother and child. Women identified as HBsAg-positive need to be evaluated for hepatitis flare during pregnancy and informed of the future risk of HBV related complications. In order to prevent transmission to their infants, infected women need counseling regarding timely immunoprophylaxis after delivery and PVST. Adherence to the 2015 CDC and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorsed algorithm for prenatal ALT, HBeAg and HBV DNA testing of HBsAg-positive women and specialist referral, along with, providing culturally and linguistically appropriate education are important steps towards optimizing the care of this patient population.

### Hepatitis B in pregnancy: challenges and treatment [^111Swupy]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) during pregnancy presents unique management challenges. Varying aspects of care must be considered, including the effects of HBV on maternal and fetal health, effects of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, treatment of HBV during and after pregnancy, and prevention of perinatal infection. Antiretroviral therapy has not been associated with increased risk of birth defects or toxicity, but despite studies designed to elucidate the drug efficacy and safety in affected individuals and the developing fetus, recommendations are inconclusive. Clinicians and patients must make individualized decisions after carefully evaluating the risks and benefits summarized in this article.

### Accelerating the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection: a scoping review of hepatitis B guidelines to reduce mother to child transmission [^117DVjEi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B (HBV) infection represents a serious global health challenge, with increasing mortality rates, resulting in 1.1 million deaths worldwide in 2022. World Health Organization (WHO) published a global strategy aiming to reduce new incidence by 90% and mortality by 65%, which will avert 9.6 million new infections and save 2.85 million lives if these goals are achieved by 2030. Eliminating mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HBV is a crucial component of this strategy, as MTCT remains a major route of HBV transmission worldwide since peripartum infections pose a higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection. Approximately 90% of those infected as neonates, 30% of children infected at 1–4 years old, and less than 5% of those infected as adults will become a chronic carrier.

The identification of hepatitis B infected individuals, coupled with antenatal maternal antiviral prophylaxis and immunoprophylaxis of infants, serve as cornerstone preventive strategies integral to guide elimination of HBV MTCT, though their implementations and successes vary across regions. For example, despite these effective interventions, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in children under five years old in 2020 was 2.53% in the African region, falling short of the WHO target of < 1% in the same year and seems a long way from the target of achieving < 0.1% in 2030.

To accelerate the momentum and reach global MTCT elimination as set by WHO, high-quality, people-centered, and evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) to guide clinicians in managing individuals with hepatitis B during pregnancy are essential. Many hepatitis B management CPGs are available, but discrepancies exist. These could create confusion and lead to significant challenges in the practical implementation across various regions owing to global inequity. We assumed that an ideal CPG should contain a comprehensive framework describing the best strategy for MTCT prevention from disease evaluation to treatment options, as well as feasible alternatives for practical implementation in resource-limited areas. Therefore, we developed 12 critical clinical questions based on various crucial elements for successful MTCT prevention. The objectives of this scoping review are to compare and evaluate all available hepatitis B CPGs against these 12 clinical questions, as well as to identify areas that require further research.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114d7grq]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Pregnancy and hepatitis B virus (HBV) — AASLD guidance statements specify screening, treatment thresholds, regimen choice, monitoring, and breastfeeding. All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg, and women newly identified as HBsAg-positive should be linked with a clinician knowledgeable in the long-term management of HBV. HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be informed of the increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) with invasive pregnancy procedures such as amniocentesis. These women require quantification of HBV DNA in the second trimester; if maternal HBV DNA is greater than 200,000 IU/mL, antiviral therapy should be started between gestational weeks 28 and 32 and continued until delivery, and therapy can be stopped at delivery or up to 3 months postpartum. If antiviral therapy is required, TDF is preferred, and there are insufficient safety data to recommend entecavir or tenofovir AF. Monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA for 6 months postpartum or after cessation of antivirals is recommended. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated, even in women who continue on antiviral therapy.

### Managing HBV in pregnancy. prevention, prophylaxis, treatment and follow-up: position paper produced by Australian, UK and New Zealand key opinion leaders [^1138yd32]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B during pregnancy presents unique management issues for both the mother and fetus. These include the lack of a current cohesive strategy for treatment and follow-up of mothers and their babies; the uncertain risk of postpartum HBV flares; the lack of randomised trial data on the safety and efficacy of antiviral treatment in pregnancy; the lack of head-to-head studies comparing different antivirals in pregnancy; and the lack of epidemiologic information regarding infection across different populations globally. This position paper provides a comprehensive review of the management of women with HBV infection prior to conception, throughout each stage of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as recommendations and clinical approaches for the follow-up of children born to infected mothers, based on available evidence in the literature and recommendations from international experts. Prevention of perinatal transmission is an important component of global efforts to reduce the burden of chronic HBV since vertical transmission is responsible for most of the chronic infection worldwide.

### A pregnant patient with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [^1137bMHU]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. The highest rates of chronic infection occur in subjects who are infected early in life and these patients are also at the greatest risk of developing complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis from the disease. There has been a concerted worldwide effort to immunise newborns that are at the highest risk of acquiring infection. In 1992, when WHO recommended global vaccination against hepatitis B, only 31 countries elected to participate in the programme. By 2009, 177 countries were part of WHO national infant immunisation programme. Consequently, maternal screening and infant immunoprophylaxis have significantly reduced vertical transmission of hepatitis B. In this paper, we will review the management of hepatitis B in the pregnant population and identify some of the challenges that are encountered in this specialised population.

There were 659 pregnant women (45.8%) who received HBV-directed monitoring, defined as having at least one ALT test plus one HBV DNA or HBeAg test during pregnancy. Asian persons had the highest HBV-directed monitoring rate during pregnancy at 60.3% than 49.5% for Black, 31.8% for Hispanic, and 24.4% for White persons (Table 2). Multivariable analysis showed that White and Hispanic persons had significantly lower (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.28 and OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.20, 0.47, respectively, p < 0.01) HBV-directed monitoring during pregnancy than Asian persons. Persons with an educational level beyond high school or who had one or two children also have higher HBV-directed monitoring during pregnancy (Table 2).

The proportion of pregnancies receiving HBV-directed monitoring within the 12 months after delivery was lower than that during pregnancy at 26.1%. Only 47% had claims for ALT, and 28.6% had claims for HBV DNA within the 12 months after delivery (Appendix Figure 2, available online). Multivariable analysis found that persons who were significantly more likely to receive testing for HBV-directed monitoring within the 12 months after delivery were Asian than White and Hispanic (p < 0.01) and persons with at least two children (p < 0.05) (Appendix Table 10, available online).

Among the 1,437 unique pregnancies with CHB diagnosis codes, 101 pregnancies (7%) had pharmacy claims for HBV antiviral during pregnancy (Appendix Figure 1, available online). A significantly higher proportion of Asian HBsAg-positive pregnant persons (10.6%, p < 0.01) had claims for HBV antiviral therapy during pregnancy than Black (3.2%), Hispanic (2.3%), and White persons (4.3%) (Appendix Table 11, available online). There were no differences in pregnant persons who received antiviral treatment by age group, education level, and number of children. Among the cohort of 962 pregnant women who were in continuous enrollment at least 12 months after delivery, 60 (6.2%) received claims for antiviral treatment in the 12 months after delivery. Asians were more likely to have claims for antiviral therapy during pregnancy and after delivery (Appendix Table 12, available online).

### Management of hepatitis B infected pregnant women: a cross-sectional study of obstetricians [^115iso4Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Our study aims to describe how obstetricians manage pregnant women infected with chronic hepatitis B in a region with a large high-risk population.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study among practicing obstetricians in Santa Clara County, California. All obstetricians practicing in Santa Clara County were invited to participate in the study. Obstetricians were recruited in person or by mail to complete a voluntary, multiple choice survey on hepatitis B (HBV). Survey questions assessed basic HBV knowledge and obstetricians' self-reported clinical practices of the management of HBV-infected pregnant women. Pooled descriptive analyses were calculated for the cohort, as well as, correlation coefficients to evaluate the association between reported clinical practices and hepatitis B knowledge.

Results

Among 138 obstetricians who completed the survey, 94% reported routinely testing pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with each pregnancy. Only 60.9% routinely advised HBsAg-positive patients to seek specialist evaluation for antiviral treatment and monitoring and fewer than half (48.6%) routinely provided them with HBV information. While most respondents recognized the potential complications of chronic HBV (94.2%), only 21% were aware that chronic HBV carries a 25% risk of liver related death when left unmonitored and untreated, and only 25% were aware of the high prevalence of chronic HBV in the foreign-born Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population. Obstetricians aware of the high risk of perinatal HBV transmission were more likely to test pregnant women for HBV DNA or hepatitis B e-antigen in HBV-infected women (r = 0.18, p = 0.033). Obstetricians who demonstrated knowledge of the long-term consequences of untreated HBV infection were no more likely to refer HBV-infected women to specialists for care (r = 0.02, p = 0.831).

Conclusion

Our study identified clear gaps in the practice patterns of obstetricians that can be readily addressed to enhance the care they provide to HBV-infected pregnant women.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112fFq6t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — prenatal screening and delivery management: All pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested, and women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, counseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg negative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated, and women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g., having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, having had recent or current injecting drug use, or having an HBsAg-positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive HBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg testing should be performed before vaccine administration, and all laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When tested at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be used, and initially reactive results should promptly expedite administration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates; HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure case management and timely and age-appropriate prophylaxis for infants. Information on the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health care provider who will care for the newborn, and household and sexual contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^112rr4sv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The UK Department of Health first published guidelines for antenatal screening for hepatitis B, vaccination and HBIG prophylaxis for infants at high risk of transmission, contact tracing and referral pathways in 1998. These best practice guidelines were updated in April 2003 and more recently in 2011. The NHS Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Screening (IDPS) Programme in England is responsible for ensuring that all pregnant women are routinely offered screening for hepatitis B, together with HIV, syphilis and susceptibility to rubella as part of their antenatal care. Routine antenatal screening for hepatitis B for all pregnant women became national policy in April 2000. All women confirmed as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, and those with a prior diagnosis, should have infectivity markers, i.e. HBeAg and antibody (anti-HBe) determined and be promptly referred to an appropriate specialist service. HBV vaccination is recommended for all exposed babies, with those born to mothers at high risk of transmission offered HBIG as well as vaccination. In late 2008, HBV DNA was included in the risk assessment of transmission determining the need for HBIG administration at birth and in September 2010, the IDPS Programme published updated standards for hepatitis B screening, including referral pathways to hepatology/specialists, and screening of family. Overall there is high coverage of antenatal screening for hepatitis B in the UK; in London, 98% of pregnant women were screened in 2006, with approximately 1200 infants born to mothers with HBV infection annually. In England, in 2011 0.42% of pregnant women screened for HBV were HBsAg positive overall, with the highest prevalence in London at 1.02%, this represented a slight decline in overall prevalence over the past five years, from 0.47% in 2007.

Despite existence of national guidelines, we observed that practices varied with regards to clinical management of pregnant women with hepatitis B, and their infants, and therefore performed an audit with maternity, hepatology, virology and paediatric colleagues in North Central London to assess adherence to UK guidelines for management of pregnant women with hepatitis B and their infants neonates in 2009 and 2010. A secondary objective was to estimate the prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity in pregnant women in this setting, and to describe the characteristics of women with chronic hepatitis B.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^112ZPCGW]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy identifies women whose infants are at risk of perinatal transmission. Data from a nationally representative sample showed a prevalence of maternal HBV infection of 85.8 cases per 100 000 deliveries from 1998 to 2011 (0.09% of live-born singleton deliveries in the United States). Although there are guidelines for universal infant HBV vaccination, rates of maternal HBV infection have increased annually by 5.5% since 1998. Children infected with HBV during infancy or childhood are more likely to develop chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection increases long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.

Objective

To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update to identify substantial new evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation. The USPSTF targeted its evidence review on the effectiveness and potential harms of screening and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission.

Findings

The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen accurately identifies HBV infection. Interventions are effective for preventing perinatal transmission, based on foundational evidence and observational studies of US case management programs. In addition, there is evidence that over time, perinatal transmission has decreased among women and infants enrolled in case management, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for HBV infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. (A recommendation).

### Management of chronic hepatitis B in pregnancy [^1138xoWA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to mother-to-child transmission during the perinatal period remains an important global health problem. Despite standard passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine in neonates, up to 8.5% of newborns still acquire HBV infection. Thus, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission are important steps in eradicating or reducing the global burden of chronic HBV infection. To date, the management of HBV infection in pregnancy still needs careful attention because of some controversial aspects, including the influence of pregnancy on the course of HBV replication, safety of antiviral prophylaxis with nucleus(t)ide analogs, postpartum flares of hepatitis after delivery, and the safety of breastfeeding. In this review, we highlight these important issues of preventive strategies in the perinatal period.

### Gaps in prenatal hepatitis B screening and management of HBsAg positive pregnant persons in the U.S., 2015–2020 [^117MsAab]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There were several limitations in the study. The Optum database is not representative of the entire U.S. population because it does not include women who are uninsured or covered by Medicaid or Veterans Administration and therefore may not be representative of the status of hepatitis B testing and management of HBsAg-positive pregnant women in the U.S. The proportion of pregnant women who did not receive HBsAg testing in this study (14.6%) is nevertheless within the range of 12.3%–18% reported among pregnancies between 2011 and 2014. Another limitation is that claims data in this study does not provide information about healthcare providers and clinical parameters, including HBsAg-positive women on antiviral therapy before they became pregnant, women who stopped antiviral treatment when they became pregnant, and whether antiviral therapy was prescribed for hepatitis flares during pregnancy or to prevent perinatal transmission. Likewise, the data do not provide information to determine whether women who did not receive ALT and HBV DNA testing or antiviral treatment were due to noncompliance or because they were not ordered or prescribed by the healthcare providers.

### # 38: hepatitis B in pregnancy screening, treatment, and prevention of vertical transmission [^113fEcbq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Between 800,000–1.4 million people in the United States and more than 240 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specific to pregnancy, an estimated prevalence of 0.7–0.9% for chronic hepatitis B infection among pregnant women in the United States has been reported, with > 25,000 infants at risk for chronic infection born annually to these women. Vertical transmission of HBV from infected mothers to their fetuses or newborns, either in utero or peripartum, remains a major source of perpetuating the reservoir of chronically infected individuals globally. Universal screening for hepatitis B infection during pregnancy has been recommended for many years. Identification of pregnant women with chronic HBV infection through universal screening has had a major impact in decreasing the risk of neonatal infection. The purpose of this document is to aid clinicians in counseling their patients regarding perinatal risks and management options available to pregnant women with hepatitis B infection in the absence of coinfection with HIV. We recommend the following: (1) perform routine screening during pregnancy for HBV infection with maternal HBsAg testing (grade 1A); (2) administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBV immunoglobulin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers or those with unknown or undocumented HBsAg status, regardless of whether maternal antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy (grade 1A); (3) In pregnant women with HBV infection, we suggest HBV viral load testing in the third trimester (grade 2B); (4) in pregnant women with HBV infection and viral load > 6–8 log₁₀ copies/mL, HBV-targeted maternal antiviral therapy should be considered for the purpose of decreasing the risk of intrauterine fetal infection (grade 2B); (5) in pregnant women with HBV infection who are candidates for maternal antiviral therapy, we suggest tenofovir as a first-line agent (grade 2B); (6) we recommend that women with HBV infection be encouraged to breast-feed as long as the infant receives immunoprophylaxis at birth (HBV vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin) (grade 1C); (7) for HBV infected women who have an indication for genetic testing, invasive testing (eg amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) may be offered-counseling should include the fact that the risk for maternal-fetal transmission may increase with HBV viral load > 7 log₁₀ IU/mL (grade 2C); and (8) we suggest cesarean delivery not be performed for the sole indication for reduction of vertical HBV transmission (grade 2C).

### Management of pregnant women and children: focusing on preventing mother-to-infant transmission [^114zJjLb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization has been effectively preventing chronic HBV infection with > 90% efficacy in countries with universal neonatal immunization. Perinatal mother-to-infant transmission of HBV remains the major cause of chronic HBV infection despite immunization. Maternal hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) and high viral load have been noted to be the most important risk factors for transmission. In recent years, short-term antiviral therapy for pregnant women in the third trimester has been shown to be highly effective in reducing 90% of vaccine failure in children. It is important to monitor maternal aminotransferase elevations postpartum. Long-term outcome of mothers and children is needed and awaits further investigations. Despite the above-mentioned preventive measures, it is also important to monitor high-risk children at 1 year of age with hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B to identify those with chronic HBV infection. Most of the children with chronic HBV infection were in the immune-tolerant phase. The goals for antiviral treatment in children are to reduce severity of liver injury, achieve HBeAg seroconversion, and prevent development of liver fibrosis and cancer. Studies on antiviral therapy are undergoing to elucidate the optimal indication and drug treatment for children. The ideal future goal of treatment is to eradicate chronic HBV infection globally.

### EASL 2017 clinical practice guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection [^113jHG7S]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem with changing epidemiology due to several factors including vaccination policies and migration. This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy is to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, and consequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA > 2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generally recommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression and HCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCC remains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Several subgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment strategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^114RfHtp]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAg-Positive

All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites (e.g. separate limbs). Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose (Table 3).
Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g. presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg-positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation).
The HepB vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). Although not indicated in the manufacturers' package labeling, Pediarix may be used for infants aged ≥ 6 weeks born to HBsAg-positive mothers to complete the vaccine series after receipt of a birth dose of single-antigen HepB vaccine and HBIG.
For infants weighing < 2,000 grams, the birth dose (i.e. the initial HepB vaccine dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of HepB vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
Postvaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series at age 9–12 months (generally at the next well-child visit following completion of the HepB vaccine series). Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of passive anti-HBs from HBIG administered at birth and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers up to age 24 months. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation). Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. HBsAg-positive infants should be referred for appropriate follow-up.
Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and receive postexposure prophylaxis may be breastfed beginning immediately after birth.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. hospital with higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).

Hepatitis B

All pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested. Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, counseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg negative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. Women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g. having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, having had recent or current injection drug use, or having an HBsAg-positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive HBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg testing should be performed before vaccine administration. All laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be used, and initially reactive results should prompt expedited administration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates. Pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure that they are entered into a case-management system and that timely and age-appropriate prophylaxis is provided to their infants. Information concerning the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health care provider who will care for the newborn. In addition, household and sexual contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.

Chlamydia

All pregnant women aged < 25 years as well as older women at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g. those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should be routinely screened for Chlamydia trachomatis at the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women who remain at increased risk for chlamydial infection also should be retested during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the neonate. Pregnant women identified as having chlamydia should be treated immediately and have a test of cure to document chlamydial eradication by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after treatment. All persons diagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be rescreened 3 months after treatment.

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^114Rso1a]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

AASLD Guidelines for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B — guiding principles, scope, and key clinical questions are outlined: the document presents official recommendations on treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection in adults and children and was developed in compliance with Institute of Medicine standards using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The guideline focuses on antiviral therapy in chronic HBV and does not address screening, prevention, or surveillance, directing readers to prior AASLD and World Health Organization resources for broader issues including diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and treatment in special populations such as liver transplant recipients. Objectives are framed as discrete clinical questions, including whether adults with immune active CHB or immune-tolerant infection should be treated with antiviral therapy to decrease liver-related complications; whether antiviral therapy should be discontinued in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive persons after HBeAg seroconversion on therapy or in persons with HBeAg-negative infection with sustained HBV DNA suppression; how entecavir compares with tenofovir regarding renal and bone health in HBV-monoinfected persons; whether adding a second antiviral agent benefits persons with persistent low levels of viremia during treatment with tenofovir or entecavir; whether persons with compensated cirrhosis and low levels of viremia should receive antiviral agents; whether pregnant women who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive with high viral load should receive third-trimester antiviral treatment to prevent perinatal transmission of HBV; and whether children with HBeAg-positive CHB should be treated to decrease liver-related complications. The target audience is health professionals caring for patients with CHB, and the guideline may assist policy makers in optimizing care for individuals living with CHB.

Table 2
Hepatitis B Practices related survey questions

Nearly one-fourth of the respondents (23.9%) did not know that California state ordinance requires physicians to report all positive HBsAg test results to the county health department, and only 64.5% routinely included a laboratory copy of the pregnant patient's HBsAg test result in the medical record sent to the birth hospital prior to the expected delivery date. 63.8% of the respondents routinely order HBV DNA or HBeAg tests in HBsAg-positive pregnant women to further assess their infectivity risks, but only 77.5% monitor their liver enzymes during pregnancy. Only 60.9% routinely advised their HBsAg-positive patients to consult with a specialist for evaluation for antiviral therapy and management (Table 2).

The mean number of correct responses for the HBV knowledge questions was 3.7 out of 5 (Table 3). Most obstetricians recognized the complications of HBV infection (94.2%), but more than one fourth (26.1%) did not know that most infected individuals are asymptomatic. Just 22.5% of obstetricians correctly identified the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in the foreign-born AANHPI population. One-third of obstetricians correctly responded that an infant has up to a 90% chance of developing chronic infection if infected at birth. Only one-fourth (25.4%) of obstetricians recognized the high mortality risk associated with chronic HBV infection.

Table 4 is a shows the correlation between the obstetricians' HBV knowledge and clinical practice. The only positive correlation we found between knowledge and practice was obstetricians who knew the high risk of chronic infection when infected at birth were more likely to test their infected patients for HBV DNA and/or HBeAg in HBsAg-positive pregnant women. There was no correlation between knowing the sequelae of chronic HBV infection (Q14, Q18) and referral of HBsAg-positive pregnant women to specialists for further management.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 6 [^115ZyS87]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in pregnancy — pregnant patients may require therapy for their own health and, for patients with elevated viral loads (greater than 200,000 international units/mL hepatitis B virus DNA; 1 million copies/mL), antiviral therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. ACOG recommends that all pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive be tested for hepatitis B virus DNA quantitatively to guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission, and pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive with high viral loads should receive antiviral treatment in the third trimester to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Although pregnancy is generally well-tolerated by individuals with hepatitis B virus infection without evidence of advanced liver disease, patients should be monitored closely during pregnancy and postpartum because, due to immunologic changes during pregnancy, there is a risk of hepatitis flare, particularly postpartum; because there is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B virus infection, supportive care is recommended, including during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of transmission, all neonates born to women who are HBsAg-positive should receive postexposure prophylaxis (ie, hepatitis B virus vaccination, hepatitis B immunoglobulin) initiated within 12 hours of birth.

### Clinical guidance for perinatal hepatitis B testing… [^117VEwP2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC recommends all pregnant patients be screened for hepatitis B virus infection during each pregnancy.
- Testing, screening, and timely treatment are essential for preventing perinatal transmission of HBV infection.
- CDC has tools and resources to help clinicians prevent perinatal hepatitis B transmission. How to make decisions on whether to screen or test HBV infection can be identified in pregnant patients and infants by a confirmed positive hepatitis B surface antigen test result. All pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive should be referred to their jurisdiction's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program for case management to ensure that their infants receive timely postexposure immunoprophylaxis and follow-up. Clinicians should provide a copy of the original laboratory report indicating the pregnant patient's HBsAg-positive test result to the:

- Hospital or birthing facility where the delivery is planned.
- Health care provider who will care for the newborn. To learn more about post-vaccination serologic testing for infants, see Perinatal Postvaccination Testing guidelines. Screening and testing guidelines Clinicians should screen all pregnant patients for HBsAg during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of:

- Vaccination status
- Chronic infection
- Testing history. Recommended tests Pregnant patients A confirmed positive HBsAg test result indicates current HBV infection. Clinicians should test all pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive for HBV DNA. This information will help the clinician make the decision to prescribe maternal antiviral therapy to prevent perinatal HBV transmission. For information on how to interpret PVST results, refer to CDC's Management of Infants Born to Women with HBV Infection for Pediatricians.

What to do next If a pregnant patients tests HBsAg-negative, clinicians should assess them to see if they're at a high risk for acquiring HBV infection. If a pregnant patients tests HBsAg-positive, there are important steps to take to help inform care and prevent perinatal transmission to the infant. Tip sheets For more information on management of pregnant patients and infants born to patients with HBV infection, see the following resource: Reporting cases CDC recommends reporting all HBsAg-positive test results of pregnant patients to the state PHBPP. Coordinators can follow up and ensure infants are evaluated appropriately.

### Management algorithm for interrupting mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus [^1143jxLg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In areas where hepatitis B virus (HBV) is endemic, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the major route of infection of children. Blocking MTCT of HBV therefore would reduce its prevalence. The China Foundation of Hepatitis Prevention and Control organized a team of specialists in infectious diseases, hepatology, immunology, obstetrics, and public health to develop an algorithm for interrupting MTCT of HBV, based on the most recent hepatitis B guidelines and latest evidence. This algorithm comprises 10 steps and has been adopted in clinical practice in China. Four aspects (screening, antiviral intervention during pregnancy, immunoprophylaxis, and postvaccination serologic testing) are the core components of preventing MTCT. Although the combination of passive and active immunization in newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers reduces MTCT of HBV, this immunoprophylaxis cannot completely eradicate MTCT. In the past decade, administration of antiviral agents to pregnant women has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing MTCT of HBV in combination with immunoprophylaxis. Aiming to achieve zero MTCT, this algorithm recommends the use of antivirals during pregnancy by women with high viral loads. Preventing MTCT is key to achieving the goal of eliminating HBV as a public health threat by 2030. Implementation and enhancement of the standardized algorithm for pregnant women with chronic HBV infection and their infants is urgently needed to prevent MTCT.

Most obstetricians (88.4%) reported they had cared for a pregnant patient who tested positive for HBsAg. The majority (94.2%) routinely tested all pregnant women for HBsAg with each pregnancy and almost 90% routinely informed HBsAg- positive pregnant women about the importance of immunoprophylaxis, including HBV immune globulin (89.9%) and the birth dose of the HBV vaccine (87.7%) within 12 h of birth. Less than half of the respondents (48.6%) routinely informed the HBsAg-positive women that their infants need to complete the three-dose HBV vaccine series, and only 20.3% routinely informed them about the need for PVST for infants. Only 76.1% informed HBsAg-positive women that their household and sexual contacts should be tested for HBV. Only 48.6% of obstetricians surveyed routinely provided educational information about HBV to their HBsAg-positive patients (Table 2).

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^1155H5tV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains endemic in many parts of the world and there are over 2 billion infected individuals worldwide. The risk of chronicity of hepatitis B is inversely related to the age of acquisition of infection; vertical transmission is associated with a risk of chronicity of more than 80%. Infants with chronic infection have a 25% lifelong risk of developing cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening of pregnant women for HBV and managing infected women and their infants appropriately in order to interrupt mother-to-child transmission is therefore of paramount importance.

The risk of vertical transmission of HBV is 70–90% when the woman is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, and around 40% when HBeAg is absent. Active or passive immunisation or both reduces the risk of vertical transmission by 90%. A high maternal viral load (VL) increases risk of transmission to the child, with babies born to women who are HBeAg positive and have a high VL (above 2 × 10⁷ IU/ml or log 8 copies/ml) having an estimated transmission risk of at least 10% despite use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and vaccination. Use of antivirals in pregnancy is suggested as a means to reduce this risk. However safety and efficacy data on use of antivirals for transmission purposes are not robust.

### The national perinatal hepatitis B prevention program, 1994–2008 [^112gz2Eo]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the trends and outcomes of the national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) for infants born from 1994 to 2008.

Methods

PHBPPs in state and city public health jurisdictions annually submitted program outcome reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual number of births to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women was estimated and used to evaluate the percentage of PHBPP-identified HBsAg-positive pregnant women. PHBPP reports were used to assess program objectives achieved, and infant outcomes by 12 to 24 months of age.

Results

From 1994 to 2008, the estimated number of annual births to HBsAg-positive women increased from 19208 to 25600 (P < .001). The annual number of PHBPP-managed infants increased (P < .001), comprising 40.8% to 50.5% of the estimated number. On average, 94.4% of PHBPP-managed infants received hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine within 1 day of birth. The percentage of infants who completed the vaccine series by age 12 months decreased from 86.0% to 77.7% (P = 0.004), but the percentage who received postvaccination testing increased from 25.1% to 56.0% (P < .001). Incidence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection among tested infants decreased from 2.1% in 1999 to 0.8% in 2008 (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

The PHBPP achieved substantial progress in preventing perinatal hepatitis B virus infection in the United States, despite an increasing number of at-risk infants. Significant gaps remain in identifying HBsAg-positive pregnant women, and completing management and assessment of their infants to ensure prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission.

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^111DhhaK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnant women with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can transmit the infection to their infants, screening of patients and appropriate interventions reduce vertical transmission. This audit was conducted to assess adherence to the national guidelines for management of HBV infection in pregnancy.

Methods

A retrospective audit was conducted on pregnant women diagnosed with hepatitis B on screening in antenatal clinics, across four hospitals in London over 2 years (2009–2010). Data was collected from antenatal records and discharge summaries using a standard audit form. The outcomes measured included HBV serological markers, HBV DNA, detection of other blood borne viruses and referral to hepatology services, administration of active and passive prophylaxis to infants at birth. Descriptive statistics are presented. Proportions were compared using the χ² test and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for prevalence estimates. Analyses were conducted using STATA 12.

Results

HBsAg was detected in 1.05% (n = 401, 95% CI 0.95–1.16) of women attending an antenatal appointment, 12% (n = 48) of the women were at a high risk of vertical transmission (HBe Ag positive or antiHBe and HBeAg negative or HBV DNA > 106 IU/ml). Only 62% (n = 248) women were referred to hepatology or specialist clinics and 29% (n = 13) of women of high infectivity were on antiviral agents. Testing for hepatitis C and delta virus was suboptimal. 75% (n = 36) of the infants at a high risk of acquisition of HBV received both active and passive prophylaxis.

Conclusion

In certain sectors of London, implementation of the pathway for management of women with hepatitis B and their infants is suboptimal. National guidelines should be followed and improved intersectorial sharing of information is needed to reduce the risk of women of high infectivity being lost to follow up.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1144Dzqw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

When seeking medical or dental care, persons who are HBsAg positive should be advised to inform their health care providers of their HBsAg status so that they can be evaluated and managed. The following are key counseling messages for persons with HBsAg:

HBV is not usually spread by hugging, coughing, food or water, sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, or casual contact.
Persons should not be excluded from work, school, play, childcare, or other settings because they are infected with HBV.
Involvement with a support group might help patients cope with chronic HBV infection.
HBV infection is a chronic condition that can be treated, and patients should receive prevention counseling and be evaluated for antiviral treatment.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Regardless of whether they have been previously tested or vaccinated, all pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit and again at delivery if at high risk for HBV infection (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection and without documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should receive hepatitis B vaccination. All pregnant women with HBsAg should be reported to state and local perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs and referred to a specialist. Information about management of pregnant women with HBsAg and their infants is available at.

HIV Infection

HIV infection can impair the response to hepatitis B vaccination. Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs 1–2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination Serologic Testing). Modified dosing regimens, including a doubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of additional doses, might increase the response rate and should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Additional recommendations for management of persons with HBsAg and HIV infection are available.

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^111EHjCQ]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B in pregnancy — The AASLD suggests antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in HBsAg-positive pregnant women with an HBV DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL; Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. The infants of all HBsAg-positive women should receive immunoprophylaxis (HBV vaccination ± hepatitis B immunoglobulin, per WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations). The only antivirals studied in pregnant women are lamivudine, tenofovir, and telbivudine; tenofovir is the preferred choice for antiviral therapy in pregnant women. Antiviral therapy was initiated at 28–32 weeks' gestation in most of the studies and was discontinued at birth to 3 months postpartum in most of the studies; with discontinuation of treatment, women should be monitored for ALT flares every 3 months for 6 months. There are limited data on the level of HBV DNA for which antiviral therapy is routinely recommended; the level of > 200,000 IU/mL (1 million copies/ mL) is a conservative recommendation. For pregnant women with immune-active hepatitis B, treatment should be based on recommendations for nonpregnant women. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated; these antivirals are minimally excreted in breast milk and are unlikely to cause significant toxicity, and the unknown risk of low-level exposure to the infant should be discussed with mothers. There are insufficient long-term safety data in infants born to mothers who took antiviral agents during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. C-section is not indicated owing to insufficient data to support benefit.

### Management of hepatitis B infected pregnant women: a cross-sectional study of obstetricians [^111pkEMu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that while self-reported compliance with HBsAg testing of pregnant women was high among obstetricians surveyed, education of women who tested positive and subsequent referral to specialist care was low. Each year obstetricians provide care to an estimated 25,000 HBsAg-positive pregnant women in the U.S. Many asymptomatic women may not have previously known about their infection, HBV transmission routes, or the risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis. Obstetricians can play an important role in protecting the entire family from HBV through education, ensuring that household or sexual contacts get tested and vaccinated, and by referring women to liver specialists.

Although most of the obstetricians surveyed reported having cared for HBsAg positive pregnant patient, less than half (46%) routinely provided their infected patients with HBV informational materials. Though alarming, this could readily be remedied. Targeted information and pamphlets in multiple languages for pregnant women with HBV are available from the CDC and the non-profit, websites.was founded as part of this CDC funded study to provide multilingual informational resources for infected mothers, as well as, for obstetrical clinics and delivery hospitals.

In our study, we found only 64.5% of obstetricians reported routinely provide the birth hospital a lab copy of the HBsAg test result, and 23.9% did not know they were required by law to report positive HBsAg tests. Obstetricians are the vital communication link between infected mothers and the healthcare system in preventing mother-to-child transmission. By providing birth hospitals with a lab copy of the HBV test result, obstetricians can reduce errors from transcription and ensure infected mothers are identified at the time of admission for delivery so their infants receive timely post-delivery immunoprophylaxis. Among the 50 states, 32 states (including California) requires healthcare providers to report pregnant women HBsAg positive tests. By promptly reporting antenatal tests positive for HBsAg to the county health department, obstetricians would enable the perinatal HBV prevention program coordinators to enroll these patients in case management.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115wdFHG]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant persons with chronic hepatitis B infection — maternal antiviral management states that for persons who are HBsAg-positive and not on antiviral therapy, HBV DNA should be assessed, and those with HBV DNA levels > 200,000 IU/mL should initiate antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (preferred) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), preferably at gestational week 28 or any time prior to delivery. Antiviral therapy can be discontinued at delivery if there is no ongoing indication other than preventing perinatal transmission, and if treatment is discontinued, HBV DNA and ALT should be monitored at intervals of 1–3 months for a period of up to six months for withdrawal flares; treatment should be reinitiated in the event of a significant withdrawal flare (ALT ≥ 5 × upper limit of normal). Persons who are known to be HBsAg-positive and receiving antiviral therapy should continue antiviral therapy throughout pregnancy and after delivery; persons receiving entecavir (ETV) should switch to TDF or TAF during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and breastfeeding is safe while taking TDF or TAF.

Counseling and prevention of hepatitis B emphasize lifestyle and maternal–infant management and health care worker precautions; heavy use of alcohol " > 20 g/d in women and > 30 g/d in men" is noted, HBsAg-positive pregnant women should inform providers so "hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine can be administered to their newborn immediately after delivery", and "HBIG and concurrent hepatitis B vaccine have been shown to be 95% efficacious in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HBV, the efficacy is lower for maternal carriers with very high serum HBV DNA levels (> 8 log₁₀ IU/mL)". For clinicians, "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who are HBsAg-positive should not perform exposure prone procedures without prior counseling and advice from an expert review panel", and "CDC does not use serum HBV DNA levels as criteria for restriction of clinical procedures, several European countries use a threshold level varying from 200 to 20,000 IU/mL to determine if HBsAg-positive health care workers are allowed to perform exposure prone procedures".

Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HBsAg Status

Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g. presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg-positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation). The infant should receive both HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth.
Women admitted for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested as soon as possible.
While maternal HBsAg test results are pending, infants with birth weights ≥ 2,000 grams born to women with an unknown HBsAg status should receive the first dose of HepB vaccine (without HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose (Table 3). If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age seven days, and the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
Because of the potentially decreased immunogenicity of vaccine in infants weighing < 2,000 grams, these infants should receive both single-antigen HepB vaccine and HBIG, administered at different injection sites (e.g. separate limbs), if the mother's HBsAg status cannot be determined within 12 hours of birth. The birth dose of vaccine should not be counted as part of the 3 doses required to complete the vaccine series; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered according to a recommended schedule on the basis of the mother's HBsAg test result. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). If it is not possible to determine the mother's HBsAg status (e.g. when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth), the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (new recommendation). The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). These infants should receive postvaccination serologic testing at age 9–12 months, and revaccination if necessary (new recommendation).
Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of passive anti-HBs from HBIG administered at birth and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers up to age 24 months. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation). Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. HBsAg-positive infants should be referred for appropriate follow-up.
Infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status may be breastfed beginning immediately after birth.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. a hospital with a higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^114cqQo5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

An audit was carried out across four teaching and district general hospitals in London providing antenatal services to the local population of approximately seven boroughs of London following the observation of variable practices in clinical management of hepatitis B in pregnancy. The audit population was pregnant women booking for antenatal care from 1 st January 2009 to 31 st December 2010 with hepatitis B, i.e. those testing positive for HBsAg at booking or with a prior diagnosis. For the HBsAg prevalence estimates, data on all pregnant women booking during this time period were used.

Data were collected using an audit data form, and were retrospectively extracted from antenatal booking records, pharmacy records and maternal and neonatal discharge summaries. The audit was registered in all four centres and was compliant with local clinical governance policies. The management of HBsAg seropositive women and their neonates was audited against the national guidance/standards applicable in 2009 and 2010 (Table 1). Data on demographics (age at booking, ethnicity), HBV serological markers (Hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] and antibody to e antigen [anti HBe]), HBV DNA testing, confirmatory serology, other tests (delta virus, HCV, HIV), maternal antiviral therapy, maternal referral and neonatal immunisation (HBIG and/or vaccine) were collected.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 6 [^113fNs6U]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the specific types of viral hepatitis, their implications during pregnancy, the risk of perinatal transmission, and issues related to both treatment and prevention of infection.

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum women and individuals who screen positive for viral hepatitis infection. The onset of these conditions may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus screening in pregnancy; prepregnancy, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum management for patients with hepatitis B virus infection or hepatitis C virus infection; management of accidental and occupational exposure to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus in pregnant health care workers; and hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus vaccination in pregnancy. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

Statistical Analysis

The Stata 12.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed to describe the demographics of the unique pregnancies and to calculate the key outcome measurements (HBsAg testing, HBV DNA, ALT, and HBeAg monitoring and antiviral treatment). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression with the generalized estimation equation model taking into consideration persons who had more than 1 pregnancy in the data set were used to evaluate the correlation between demographic characteristics of pregnancies with HBV testing, disease monitoring, and antiviral treatment. Variables with p < 0.25 in univariable analysis were included in multivariable analysis. Adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs were used to provide further insight regarding the relative importance of each independent variable on the outcome variable. Degree of statistical significance was declared at a p ≤ 0.05.

Hepatitis B virus infection — antenatal testing and perinatal prophylaxis in pregnant women with HIV: All pregnant women with HIV should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during the first trimester of each pregnancy, with testing repeated in late pregnancy or at hospital admission for delivery for HBsAg-negative people at high risk, and pregnant women with HIV who do not have documentation of HepB vaccination should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (strong, moderate); HBsAg-positive pregnant women should also have an HBV DNA quantitative test and a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) test and be referred for hepatitis B–related clinical management. Prevention for newborns relies on a birth dose (within 12 hours after birth is optimal) of the HepB vaccine for all infants, with infants of HBsAg-positive women also receiving hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth; if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown, infants should receive HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth with HBIG provided within 12 hours of birth for infants (weighing < 2,000 grams) or within 7 days (for infants ≥ 2,000 grams), and when indicated HBIG should be administered concurrently with the first HepB vaccine dose at a different anatomic site, while infants of HBsAg-negative women with other evidence of HBV infection should be managed as though born to HBsAg-positive women.

### Obstetricians' and gynecologists' knowledge, education, and practices regarding chronic hepatitis B in pregnancy [^113z4Qdu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Between 800,000 and 1.4 million people in the United States are infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to 50% of cases worldwide. There is an estimated prevalence of 0.7–0.9% of chronic HBV among pregnant women in the US, with > 25,000 neonates at risk for chronic infection annually.

Obstetricians and gynecologists (OB-GYNs) perform a key role in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). To provide optimal care of pregnant women who are HBV carriers, OB-GYNs need appropriate knowledge, education, and practice in the management of these patients.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of OB-GYNs (ACOG) have both published recommendations for screening for HBV among pregnant women, calling for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as the initial serological testing for all pregnant women, followed by hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA viral load, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). If HBeAg is positive, HBV DNA > 20,000 IU/mL, or ALT ≥ 19 IU/L, then the patient should be referred to a specialist immediately during pregnancy.

The 2016 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines suggest antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in pregnant women with an HBV DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL (> 1 million copies/mL). The 2016 Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine consensus recommends third-trimester HBV viral load testing and antiviral therapy over a greater range of viral load (HBV DNA > 1 million to 100 million copies/mL) compared to the AASLD recommendation.

The current survey aimed to determine the knowledge, education, and practices of OB-GYNs regarding HBV in pregnant women. In addition, we determined referral patterns and thresholds for OB-GYNs to treat patients with HBV.

Results

Prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity and characteristics of pregnant women with HBV

A total of 38,227 pregnant women were booked for antenatal care during 2009 and 2010, of whom 401 were HBsAg positive (1.05%; 95% CI 0.95, 1.16) overall. There was no difference in prevalence between 2009 (194/18473, 1.05%) and 2010 (207/19755, 1.05%) (p = 0.5). Hospital 4 (H4) had significantly higher prevalence than the other three hospitals (p < 0.001), with prevalence of ≥ 2% in both 2009 and 2010 (Figure 1). There were no cases of acute hepatitis B noted during the study period.

Figure 1
Prevalence of Hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) among women booking for antenatal care, by hospital of booking (H1, H2, H3, H4), 2009–2010.

Table 2 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of the pregnant women with hepatitis B by hospital: overall, 39% of women were black African (n = 158), 21% Asian (mainly Chinese) (n = 84), 19% white (n = 78), 17% (n = 67) other or mixed ethnicity, with 4% (n = 14) having no information available. Median age at antenatal booking was 29 years (range of 15 to 46 years). With respect to serological markers of infectivity, 9% (34/401) of women were HBeAg positive and anti HBe negative, 90% (359/401) were HBeAg negative, anti HBe positive and eight women were HBeAg negative and anti HBe negative. The proportion of women with high infectivity markers was similar across the study hospitals (Table 2). Sixty- six percent of the women across the 4 hospitals had their serology reconfirmed (263/401) (Table 2).

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115h4ecn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

No specific treatment exists for acute HBV infection; supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. Guidelines for management of chronic HBV infection in children and adults, including disease monitoring and antiviral therapy, are available. Antiviral therapy generally should be initiated in patients with chronic HBV infection who are likely to respond to treatment and who are at high risk for liver-related morbidity. Maternal antiviral therapy to reduce perinatal transmission is suggested for HBsAg-positive pregnant women whose HBV DNA level is > 200,000 IU/mL.

In areas in which HBV is highly endemic, HBV frequently is transmitted perinatally from HBV-infected pregnant women to their newborns. The majority of cases of perinatal HBV transmission occur during delivery, with rare instances of in utero transmission. HBV transmission might occur in germ cell lines, as the virus has been detected in sperm, oocytes, and embryos. Available data do not support the need for a cesarean delivery among HBV-infected pregnant women with low HBV DNA. Prior to the widespread availability of postexposure prophylaxis, the proportion of infants born to HBsAg-positive women acquiring HBV infection was approximately 30% for those born to HBeAg-negative mothers and 85% for those born to HBeAg-positive mothers. With postexposure prophylaxis, comprised of HepB vaccine and HBIG at birth, followed by completion of the HepB vaccine series, 0.7%–1.1% of infants develop infection; infants born to mothers with high viral loads are at greatest risk for infection despite receipt of HepB vaccine and HBIG. Unvaccinated infants and children are also at risk for horizontal transmission from infected household and other contacts.

### Management of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: propositions and challenges [^116VuaW1]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during perinatal period remains an important global health problem. Despite standard passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine in neonates, up to 9% of newborns still acquire HBV infection, especially these from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers. Management of HBV infection in pregnancy still need to draw careful attention because of some controversial aspects, including the failure of passive-active immunoprophylaxis in a fraction of newborns, the effect and necessity of periodical hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) injection to the mothers, the safety of antiviral prophylaxis with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, the benefit of different delivery ways, and the safety of breastfeeding. In this review, we highlight these unsettled issues of preventive strategies in perinatal period, and we further aim to provide an optimal approach to the management of preventing MTCT of HBV infection.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^111DrVxf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy with chronic hepatitis B — screening and residual transmission risk: Screening for HBV infection in all pregnant persons during their initial prenatal visit, for every pregnancy, using a triple panel (HBsAg, anti-HBs and total anti-HBc) is strongly recommended by the CDC and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines (USPSTF), and a positive HBsAg result should be followed by quantitative HBV DNA, HBeAg, and ALT testing. Despite the appropriate administration of HBIG and birth-dose vaccination within 24 hours of birth, perinatal transmission of HBV occurs in approximately 8–10% of infants born to HBsAg-positive pregnant persons with HBV DNA levels > 200,000 IU/mL. The 2018 AASLD conditional recommendations for these individuals included initiating TDF therapy (preferred) at gestational weeks 28–32, continuing until delivery or up to three months postpartum.

### Management of hepatitis B and C during pregnancy: neonatal implications [^113E1oCV]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last several decades, we have seen increased rates of infants born to persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Due to this, many obstetric and pediatric organizations have updated their guidelines about screening and management of HBV and HCV during pregnancy, as well as the management of the exposed infant. Current guidelines suggest that all pregnant individuals should be screened for both HBV and HCV during each pregnancy. Appropriate medical care of pregnant persons and the newborn can significantly reduce the risk of vertical transmission.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111aqZtR]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV screening and infant management — It is recommended that HBV screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) occur for all during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing. The CDC recommends that infants perinatally exposed to HBsAg be tested for HBsAg. In the context of a positive maternal HBsAg screening, all infants, including those with perinatal HIV exposure, should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the first dose of the HBV vaccine series as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours after birth, followed by the routine HBV vaccine series, and post-vaccination serologic testing for HBV should be performed between 9 and 12 months of age; infants with detectable HBV DNA should be managed in consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric HBV management.

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^1127fteL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Standardisation of the pathway of management of women with hepatitis B and their infants based on national guidelines is required to improve the care provided across the sector, and rigorous auditing should be implemented. The new detection of maternal infection should be seized as an opportunity to provide appropriate care to the mother and family contacts as well as the child. Testing for other blood borne viruses should be included in the pathway. Data regarding the use of antivirals in pregnancy should be systematically collected as their use in pregnancy for reducing risk of transmission is relatively new and questions remain regarding efficacy and safety. As the management of these women and infants is complex, there is a need for the different teams within hospitals and the community to work much more closely together and improved intersectorial sharing of information is needed to reduce the risk of women of high infectivity being lost to follow up.

Ethical approval

Ethical approval not required as this was an audit, however the audit was compliant with the local clinical governance policies at each participating hospital.

### Safeguarding mothers and newborns: the urgent need to address hepatitis During pregnancy [^115K5KGk]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal and timely management of pregnant women and infants is vital to global efforts aimed at eliminating viral hepatitis. As no vaccine is available to protect against HCV, the focus is on identifying infected women, minimizing obstetrical contributions to perinatal transmission risks, and closely monitoring infants. Region-specific strategies, supported by national elimination plans and sufficient resources, are necessary to address the epidemiology and disease burden effectively. For instance, the TiP-HepC Registry project, led by the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination and supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aims to consolidate existing data and engage stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the treatment of HCV during pregnancy. Another example is the WHO's Triple Elimination Initiative, which urges countries to commit to eliminating the transmission of HIV, syphilis, and HBV from mother to child, promoting integrated service delivery.

Certainly, managing viral hepatitis during pregnancy requires special consideration. However, raising awareness among potentially infected individuals and sharing the ABCs of Viral Hepatitis is probably even more critical due to the risk of vertical transmission. Often, women are unaware of their infection and can pass it to their infants during childbirth, causing long-term liver damage, liver cancer, and cirrhosis: According to the latest WHO report, only 9% of those living with HBV infection knew their status. Therefore, the CDC recommends that all adults undergo testing for hepatitis B and C at least once in their lifetime, with pregnant women requiring testing during each pregnancy, as it is the only reliable method to determine hepatitis status.

Hepatitis in pregnancy revolves around the risk of vertical transmission, but interventions exist to prevent or reduce negative outcomes. The WHO's 2016 strategy on viral hepatitis set an ambitious goal to eliminate it as a public health issue by 2030, targeting a 90% reduction in incidence and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015. While England has already succeeded in meeting the new WHO targets for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, achieving over 90% infant HBV vaccination coverage, hepatitis C among pregnant women has risen tenfold over the past 20 years in the USA, emphasizing the importance of universal screening for HCV infection in pregnancy. The urgency of addressing viral hepatitis during pregnancy cannot be underestimated: It cannot wait, and it is a responsibility we must all take seriously to ensure a healthier future for both mothers and their newborns.

METHODS

Study Sample

Deidentified data of patients' demographics, diagnosis, and insurance claims were obtained from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (Optum 5.0) database between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020 hosted at the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences. In 2014, approximately 19% of the U.S. population in commercial health plans and 19% of those in Medicare Advantage plans were represented in Optum's administrative data assets. Unique pregnancies were identified by searching medical claims for live birth and delivery-related diagnosis and procedure codes (Appendix Tables 1 and 2, available online). Pregnancies among persons aged 15–55 years who had at least 1 delivery or live birth-related code entered between January 01, 2015 and December 31, 2019 and were in continuous enrollment at least 42 weeks before the delivery date were included in this study (Appendix Figure 1, available online).

Measures

To evaluate HBsAg testing during pregnancy, medical claims were searched for current procedural terminology codes for laboratory tests that included HBsAg within 42 weeks before delivery (Appendix Table 3, available online). Unique pregnancies with CHB diagnosis were defined as having at least one International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or ICD-10 diagnosis code for CHB (Appendix Table 4, available online). Pregnancies in which the mothers had at least 1 diagnosis code for HIV or hepatitis C virus before delivery were excluded from the monitoring and treatment evaluation. CHB monitoring and treatment during pregnancy and after delivery was based on unique HBsAg-positive pregnancies with at least 1 current procedural terminology code for laboratory tests for ALT, HBV DNA, and HBeAg (Appendix Table 5, available online) and prescription claims for at least 1 brand or generic HBV antiviral medication (Appendix Table 6, available online) within 42 weeks before the delivery date and within 12 months after delivery. This secondary analysis of deidentified insurance claims data was approved under the Stanford University Center for Population Health Sciences umbrella IRB 40974.

### Indications for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B in pregnant mothers [^117WbKAE]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The use of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the setting of pregnancy needs to be individualised based on limited data. We report a case of a 34-year-old Korean-American woman with a history of pregnancy with emergent caesarean section due to prolonged labour in the setting of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic HBV with a pretreatment baseline HBV DNA level of 110000000 million copies per mL. Her first delivery was complicated by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV infection to her daughter despite standard active and passive immunoprophylaxis. Our case report highlights an important clinical decision-making step regarding the timing of antiviral therapy in the management of chronic HBV in pregnant women with high risk of MTCT.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^113oerN4]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for HBV with serologic testing for HBsAg in every pregnant patient at the earliest prenatal visit, and pregnant women found to be positive for HBsAg should then be tested for HBV DNA. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices similarly recommends testing for HBsAg in all pregnant women during an early prenatal visit (eg, in the first trimester) and HBV DNA testing for pregnant women whose test positive for HBsAg. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends screening in all pregnant women by testing for HBsAg and the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs).
