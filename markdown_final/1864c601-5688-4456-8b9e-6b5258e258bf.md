## Question

Can atenolol be used to close a ventricular septal defect?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atenolol can be used to close a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of VSD and what actually results in anatomical closure. Then, I should verify atenolol's pharmacologic mechanism to see if there is any plausible structural effect on a septal defect. Next, I will examine guideline-supported and published closure strategies for VSDs. After that, I need to check whether any evidence exists for pharmacologic closure with beta-blockers and consider potential harms of atenolol in unrepaired shunts. Finally, I will confirm atenolol's legitimate roles in VSD patients, if any, and synthesize a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: a VSD is a structural hole between the ventricles that either closes spontaneously (especially in many muscular defects), or is closed by mechanical means — surgery or transcatheter/device closure — when indicated, not by medicines per se [^112Eq9rD] [^115nYvm8] [^112LCSKr].

> Now, I should review atenolol's mechanism to see if there is any pathway that would physically close a septal defect. Atenolol is a beta1-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker that lowers heart rate and cardiac output and suppresses renin, with no known effect on tissue growth, septal remodeling, or occlusive structural repair, so there is no biologic plausibility that atenolol would close a VSD [^1159t1a2] [^116wG8a1] [^1147mtny].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify what established closure strategies are and whether any pharmacologic option is endorsed. Contemporary management of VSDs relies on observation for spontaneous closure in many infants, surgical repair when hemodynamically significant or complicated, and selected transcatheter/device options; none of these frameworks include beta-blockers as a means to achieve anatomic closure [^112Eq9rD] [^115nYvm8] [^112LCSKr].

> Wait, let me double-check if any literature or guidelines even hint that beta-blockers close septal defects. I find beta-blockers used in congenital heart disease primarily for rate control and arrhythmia risk mitigation, not for defect closure; for example, adult congenital heart disease guidance discusses beta-blockers for ventricular arrhythmia risk reduction, not for sealing defects, which supports the absence of a pharmacologic closure role here [^117JJYt1].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what if atenolol's hemodynamic effects could reduce the shunt enough to "functionally" approximate closure? I need to be precise: while beta-blockade can lower heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, it does not eliminate the anatomic communication; moreover, in larger unrepaired shunts or susceptible patients, beta-blockade can depress contractility and unmask or worsen heart failure, which argues against using atenolol to "treat" the defect itself rather than the symptoms, and highlights potential harm if misapplied [^116wG8a1] [^112EBvTr] [^1168iUB1].

> Let me consider legitimate clinical contexts where atenolol might still be appropriate in a patient who has a VSD. Atenolol may be used for standard indications such as hypertension, rate control, or arrhythmia management in selected congenital heart disease scenarios, but this is adjunctive care that does not modify the existence of the VSD; dosing for hypertension, for example, follows routine adult dosing and is unrelated to closing the defect [^117JJYt1] [^1121JHz9].

> I should confirm the net synthesis: there is a mechanism mismatch (functional beta-blockade versus structural closure), an evidence mismatch (no trials or guidelines supporting pharmacologic closure), and established closure pathways are mechanical or spontaneous, not drug-induced; therefore, atenolol cannot be used to close a VSD, though it may be used for unrelated indications in a patient who happens to have a VSD [^112Eq9rD] [^115nYvm8] [^112LCSKr] [^1159t1a2].

Atenolol does not close ventricular septal defects (VSDs). It is a beta-blocker used for symptom control in VSD patients with arrhythmias or heart failure, but it has **no effect on defect closure** [^117JJYt1]. VSDs **close spontaneously or require surgical or device closure** when hemodynamically significant [^112Eq9rD] [^115nYvm8]. Atenolol is **not indicated for VSD closure** and should not be used for this purpose [^113wsiTQ].

---

## Pharmacological properties of atenolol

Atenolol is a **selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist** [^1147mtny] that reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output, thereby lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand [^116wG8a1]. It is commonly used to treat hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmias [^1147mtny].

---

## Clinical indications for atenolol

Atenolol is **indicated for the following cardiovascular conditions**:

- Hypertension [^1121JHz9]
- Angina pectoris
- Myocardial infarction (acute and secondary prevention) [^1159t1a2]
- Arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular) [^112h9Yvs]

Atenolol is **not indicated for closure of structural cardiac defects** such as VSDs [^113wsiTQ].

---

## Mechanism of action of atenolol

Atenolol exerts its therapeutic effects by **selectively blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors** in the heart, leading to:

- Reduced heart rate (negative chronotropic effect)
- Decreased myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect)
- Lowered cardiac output
- Reduced myocardial oxygen demand

These effects help manage hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias, but they do not affect the structural integrity or closure of cardiac defects such as VSDs [^112LCSKr].

## Ventricular septal defect (VSD): pathophysiology and management

A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a congenital cardiac anomaly characterized by an **abnormal opening in the interventricular septum** that results in a left-to-right shunt from the left to the right ventricle. This shunt can increase pulmonary blood flow and lead to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and other complications if left untreated [^113wsiTQ] [^116vsBym]. Management depends on defect size, shunt magnitude, and the presence of symptoms or complications. Small VSDs may **close spontaneously** [^112Eq9rD], whereas larger defects or those causing significant symptoms typically require surgical or device closure [^112LCSKr].

---

## Atenolol and VSD closure: clinical evidence

There is **no clinical evidence or scientific rationale** supporting the use of atenolol for VSD closure, because it lacks pharmacological properties that would promote tissue growth, fibrosis, or structural closure of cardiac defects [^1147mtny]. Atenolol may be used symptomatically in patients with VSD who experience arrhythmias or heart failure to control heart rate, reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and relieve symptoms, but it **does not influence anatomical closure** of the defect [^117JJYt1].

---

## Alternative medical therapies for VSD closure

Currently, there are **no pharmacological agents approved or recommended** for VSD closure. Medical management primarily focuses on symptomatic relief and stabilization until definitive surgical or device closure can be performed [^113wsiTQ].

---

## Surgical and device closure of VSD

Definitive VSD closure is **achieved through surgical or device interventions**. Surgical closure involves **open-heart surgery** with cardiopulmonary bypass and direct closure of the defect using sutures or patches, while **device closure** uses minimally invasive transcatheter procedures that deploy occluder devices to seal the defect [^115nYvm8] [^112rzUno]. These interventions are **effective in closing VSDs** and preventing complications associated with persistent shunting [^111Bws6i].

---

## Risks and complications of atenolol in VSD patients

Atenolol, like other beta-blockers, **carries potential risks and complications**, particularly in patients with congenital heart defects [^112EBvTr]:

- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Heart failure exacerbation
- Bronchospasm (particularly in patients with reactive airway disease)
- Fatigue and dizziness [^1166mXBz]

These risks should be carefully considered when prescribing atenolol to patients with VSDs or other congenital heart defects.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend atenolol** or any other beta-blocker for VSD closure. Beta-blockers may be used symptomatically in patients with congenital heart disease who experience arrhythmias or heart failure, but they do not influence anatomical closure of cardiac defects [^117JJYt1] [^113wsiTQ].

---

## Conclusion

Atenolol **does not close ventricular septal defects** and is used for symptom control in VSD patients with arrhythmias or heart failure, and it has no effect on defect closure. VSDs close spontaneously or require surgical or device closure if hemodynamically significant [^113wsiTQ]. Accordingly, atenolol is **not indicated** for VSD closure and should not be used for this purpose.

### Tenoretic [^1147mtny]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Atenolol and chlorthalidone have been used singly and concomitantly for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive, and studies have shown that there is no interference with bioavailability when these agents are given together in the single combination tablet. Therefore, this combination provides a convenient formulation for the concomitant administration of these two entities. In patients with more severe hypertension, Tenoretic may be administered with other antihypertensives such as vasodilators.

- **Atenolol**: Atenolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activities. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, atenolol inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rates and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours and persists for at least 24 hours.

### Ventricular septal defect [^113wsiTQ]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects account for up to 40% of all congenital cardiac malformations. The diagnosis encompasses a broad range of anomalies, including isolated defects and those associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. Presentation, symptoms, natural history, and management of ventricular septal defects depend on the size and anatomical associations of the anomaly, the patient's age, and local diagnostic and interventional expertise.

In this seminar, the anatomical range of ventricular septal defects is described, and present management of these malformations is discussed. Genetic determinants, diagnostic techniques, physiological considerations, and management challenges are examined in detail. Unfortunately, in many circumstances, evidence on which to guide optimum management is scarce. Longer-term considerations of ventricular septal defects in adolescents and adults are presented, with particular emphasis on patients with raised pulmonary vascular resistance and Eisenmenger's syndrome.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^116wG8a1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10%) increase in stroke volume at rest and exercise.

In controlled clinical trials, atenolol given as a single daily dose was an effective antihypertensive agent, providing a 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and prazosin, with the combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents.

The dose range of atenolol is narrow, and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including:
1. Competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output.
2. A central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery.
3. Suppression of renin activity.

Results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol.

### Ventricular septal defect with secondary left ventricular-to-right atrial shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis and a lower late chance of closure [^114C3K3Q]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Although ventricular septal aneurysm may diminish or even close the shunt through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), developing a left ventricular-to-right atrial (LV-RA) shunt may be unfavorable. This study sought to clarify this issue based on an extended observation of such patients.

Sixty-eight patients (1201 patient-years) who had small perimembranous VSD and LV-RA shunt and were not operated on before 6 years of age were studied. The onset age of LV-RA shunt was 5.8 ± 3.3 years, with clinical improvement later observed in 23 (34%). The murmur disappeared and showed spontaneous closure in 5 (7%). Seven episodes of infective endocarditis occurred in 6 patients (8.7%, or 58 per 10,000 patient-years), with 2 receiving surgery. Another 4 received surgery during follow-up. With echocardiography, aneurysmal transformation involving the anterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve (double sac) was found in 56 patients (85%), whereas only the septal leaflet (single sac) was involved in 10. Patients with double sac were less likely to show improvement, whereas patients who had superior QRS axis and were female showed clinical improvement more frequently.

In conclusion, VSD with secondary LV-RA shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis but still has a low chance for late improvement and even closure.

### Closure of symptomatic ventricular septal defects: How early is too early [^1152pw28]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

With improvements in technology and surgical technique, pediatric cardiologists are increasingly challenging surgeons to close symptomatic ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in ever-smaller patients. Although delaying surgery may facilitate operative repair, early intervention decreases the period of time these patients require therapy to prevent heart failure, maintains growth, and minimizes exposure to increased pulmonary pressures. To evaluate early intervention, we compared the outcomes of VSD closure in different-sized children.

From December 2002 to July 2005, 225 patients underwent closure of a VSD. These patients were divided into four weight-based groups:

- **Less than 4 kg (group 1)**: n = 47
- **4 to 6 kg (group 2)**: n = 53
- **6 to 10 kg (group 3)**: n = 68
- **More than 10 kg (group 4)**: n = 57

We reviewed operative and postoperative data, and comparisons were made between the groups. Median weights and ages at the time of surgery were as follows:

- **Group 1**: 3.5 kg and 77 days
- **Group 2**: 4.9 kg and 128 days
- **Group 3**: 7.1 kg and 309 days
- **Group 4**: 18.2 kg and 190 days

Operative data included cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), aortic cross-clamp, and procedure times. CPB (p = 0.064), cross-clamp (p = 0.665), and procedure (p = 0.187) times were not significantly affected by decreasing weight. Postoperative continuous data included duration of ventilation and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Ventilation (p = 0.667), ICU (p = 0.976) times, and length of hospital stay (p = 0.905) were also unaffected by decreasing weight. Postoperative categorical data included complications and presence of a residual defect.

### Survival of patients with congenital ventricular septal defect [^111eXrLd]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

In the study, early diagnosis before the age of 18 years was associated with higher mortality compared with late diagnosis, which could be explained by the fact that the majority of patients with symptomatic lesions are detected early due to heart failure and failure to thrive, and so by inference are the larger defects. Nonetheless, VSD patients diagnosed beyond the age of 18 years still have a late hazard for mortality that is almost two-fold that of the comparison cohort.

Dissecting the risk of mortality in surgically closed patients, our data show a 30-year survival after surgical VSD closure of 90%, which is in line with previously published papers showing 40-year survival rates of 86%, 81%, and 79%, respectively. Raissadati et al. demonstrated a 50-year survival of 77% after surgical VSD repair. Our data suggest that VSD patients surgically managed in the modern era present with similar survival and risk of mortality as the general population. However, with limited follow-up only until their 4th decade of life, we are unable to conclude that their long-term outcome is unproblematic thereafter since the mortality rate for unrepaired patients increases at around 50–60 years of age.

Furthermore, early closure of VSD before the age of 5 years was associated with substantial mortality, while those closed late seem to have a mortality risk comparable with the general population. This is not unexpected given that older patients will likely have smaller, hemodynamically less significant defects.

It is difficult to define which VSD patients have a favorable long-term outcome due to the limitations in follow-up data.

- **Correlations**: For patients with a surgically closed VSD, the mental component summary score and general health perception were both negatively correlated with perceived stress level, whereas self-estimated role physical was positively correlated with peak oxygen uptake from a previously reported exercise test. No significant associations were found for either age of repair or defect size for the surgically closed VSDs. For patients with unrepaired VSDs, the HRQoL domain bodily pain was positively correlated with peak oxygen uptake. Results are further detailed in Figure 3.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with congenital heart disease, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of β-blockers to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. This is especially pertinent for adult patients with repaired severe complexity adult congenital heart disease and frequent or complex ventricular arrhythmias (VA).

### Survival of patients with congenital ventricular septal defect [^112KbUkL]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with VSD have increased late mortality compared with that of the general Danish population. Patients with unrepaired and surgically closed defects both demonstrated an almost three-fold higher risk of mortality than their matched peers.

Survival improved for both unrepaired and surgically closed patients in the modern era, but contemporary cohorts still show increased mortality. These novel findings suggest that even though deemed a 'simple' congenital heart defect, the diagnosis comes with significant long-term consequences. Thus, the most common of cardiac defects is deserving of a better understanding of the complex factors that can lead to a major increase in lifetime mortality.

### Comparison of the clinical effect between the lower sternal incision and the left parasternal fourth intercostal incision in the transthoracic closure of ventricular septal defect [^112GtNLC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases (CHD), accounting for approximately 20% of all CHD, with 80% being perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PmVSD). Various procedures are available to treat VSD, including traditional repair of ventricular septal defect (RVSD), transthoracic closure of ventricular septal defect (TTCVSD), and percutaneous closure of ventricular septal defect (PTCVSD). The TTCVSD procedure results in only a small incision on the skin surface, achieving an impressive cosmetic effect. This study aims to compare the advantages and disadvantages of two surgical approaches: the left sternum intercostal incision and the substernal incision, providing more evidence for the rational selection of VSD operation.

### Early ventricular septal defect closure prevents the progression of aortic regurgitation: A long-term follow-up study [^111Bws6i]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

According to short-term evidence, ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure should be performed as early as possible after aortic regurgitation (AR) diagnosis in pediatric patients to prevent AR progression. However, long-term follow-up data are lacking. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the long-term follow-up (≥ 10 years) of patients who underwent VSD closure as early as possible after AR diagnosis and to evaluate whether early VSD closure prevents progression of AR. This was a retrospective cohort study of 42 patients with VSD and AR who had undergone VSD closure at a median age of 2.9 years, with a median waiting period from AR diagnosis to VSD closure of 3.4 months and follow-up of a median 13.1 years (interquartile range 10.0–15.8 years). The preoperative degree of AR was trivial in 25 patients, mild in 15, and moderate in 2.

Of the 33 patients followed up for ≥ 10 years, none required aortic valve replacement and there was no incidence of mortality. The degree of AR improved or did not change, except in 1 patient. The size of the VSD (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.18; p = 0.33), time from diagnosis to surgery (OR 1.00; 95% CI 1.000–1.001; p = 0.657), and age at the time of surgery (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.998–1.004; p = 0.452) were not predictive of persistent postoperative AR. Therefore, VSD closure performed as early as possible after AR diagnosis could successfully prevent AR progression in patients with less than moderate preoperative AR, eliminating the need for aortic valve replacement and valvuloplasty.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, specifically for patients with congenital heart disease, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation for potential residual anatomic or coronary abnormalities. This is especially important for adult patients with repaired complex congenital heart disease who present with frequent, complex, or sustained ventricular arrhythmias or unexplained syncope.

### The unnatural history of the ventricular septal defect: Outcome up to 40 years after surgical closure [^115T3FWD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Few prospective data are available regarding long-term outcomes after surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes more than 30 years after surgical VSD closure.

Patients who underwent surgical VSD closure during childhood between 1968 and 1980 were reexamined every 10 years. In 2012, eligible patients were invited to undergo another examination, which included electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, bicycle ergometry, measurement of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and subjective health assessment.

Cumulative survival was 86% at 40 years. Causes of mortality included arrhythmia, heart failure, endocarditis, during valvular surgery, pulmonary hypertension, noncardiac causes, and unknown causes. Cumulative event-free survival after surgery was 72% at 40 years. Symptomatic arrhythmias occurred in 13% of patients, and surgical or catheter-based reinterventions occurred in 12%. The prevalence of impaired right ventricular systolic function increased from 1% in 2001 to 17% in 2012 (p = 0.001). Left ventricular systolic function was impaired but stable in 21% of patients. Aortic regurgitation became more frequent in the last 20 years (p = 0.039), and mean exercise capacity decreased (p = 0.003). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was elevated (> 14 pmol/l) in 38% of patients, with a median of 11.6 pmol/l (interquartile range: 7.0 to 19.8 pmol/l). A concomitant cardiac lesion, such as a patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic cross-clamp time were determinants of late events.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115ushoU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommendations**: Should children with progressive PH despite optimal therapy undergo ASD intervention (creation and/or enlargement)?

- **Background**: Survival of children with PH has improved over the past two decades because of the introduction of pharmacological agents; however, the disease remains progressive, with significant variability in severity and prognosis despite optimal medical therapy. Prior guidelines recommended ASD intervention for patients with symptoms of RV failure, syncope, or PH crises that persist despite optimized medical management. By generating a shunt at the atrial level, LV preload and cardiac output can be improved at the expense of decreased systemic oxyhemoglobin saturation. Importantly, the relief provided by ASD intervention for a failing right ventricle is only volume unloading rather than pressure unloading, with no direct reduction of RV afterload. The time elapsed since the previous guideline, as well as the consideration of evolving approaches to this intervention, prompted the panel to ask, should children with progressive PH despite optimal therapy undergo ASD intervention (creation and/or enlargement)?

- **Summary of the evidence**: A systematic review of the literature identified 12 observational studies that met our inclusion criteria and provided the highest tier evidence available related to ASD intervention in children with PH. Most studies were purely descriptive, with few analyses performed. Five studies included children only. For the remaining studies, child-specific data were available for six.

### What is blocking transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure [^112LCSKr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are among the most common congenital heart defects, with an incidence rate of 3 to 3.5 per 1000 live births. VSDs range in size from tiny pinholes to the near absence of the ventricular septum. Perimembranous VSDs (pmVSDs) account for 80% of VSDs, involving the membranous septum. The membranous septum is adjacent to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve on its right ventricular aspect and to the aortic valve on its left ventricular aspect, while its inferoposterior margin closely relates to the bundle of His and bundle branches.

Spontaneous VSD closure is common, but invasive closure is indicated in a subset. Although surgery has long been the standard approach, transcatheter options have been available for decades. The first human experience of transcatheter closure (of muscular VSDs) was reported in 1988 by Lock et al. Investigators have since explored various approaches and devices for transcatheter device VSD closure, with widely varying rates of success and risk of complications. With improvements in device technology and techniques, transcatheter VSD closure is increasingly appealing, given the associated shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. Despite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any device for the indication of transcatheter closure of a pmVSD.

### Novel postoperative use of beta-blocking medication for infants with left ventricular outflow obstruction and diastolic myocardial dysfunction [^112Aa55z]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Severe left ventricular outflow obstruction is often associated with diastolic left ventricular myocardial dysfunction and tachycardia despite successful initial treatment. The authors have used esmolol to lower heart rate in this setting for successful weaning of patients from ventilation in postoperative recovery. Their limited experience supports the beneficial effect of continuous esmolol administration on infants with persistent tachycardia and severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in postoperative cardiac intensive care.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of isolated ventricular septal defects in utero and postnatal life [^1176fY4q]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in the western world is 0.3–1.2% of live births. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect, accounting for 20–30% of all congenital heart defects. In a recent study, Zhao et al. described a 2.66% prevalence of CHD at live birth in China using echocardiographic screening, and they also found only a 1.21% prevalence of CHD that could be detected by clinical evaluation, with the most common CHD being VSD at a prevalence of 1.73%. VSDs can occur alone or in combination with other cardiac defects. However, the majority of VSDs occur alone and are referred to as "isolated" or "simple", and the study has therefore focused on isolated VSDs. VSDs are typically asymptomatic and often close spontaneously.

Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with pulsed Doppler or Doppler color flow mapping is a well-established technique to diagnose and localize fetal and infant VSDs. The present study utilized fetal echocardiography and state at birth to evaluate the incidence and timing of spontaneous closure (SC) of VSD in patients who were diagnosed with VSD prenatally in eastern China. There have been a number of observational long-term follow-up studies on SC of VSD, but few of these reports were followed up from the fetal period. Here, we present a long-term follow-up study in which subjects were followed up from the fetal period and summarized a prediction formula including factors influencing SC of VSD. We found that birth weight was a prognostic variable for SC of VSD, which was most useful.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^112ygRUX]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

There were many limitations in this study:

- **Sample size and duration**: The number of patients was not sufficient, and the follow-up time was inadequate. More cases and extended follow-up are required to validate the model.
- **Lack of comprehensive data**: This study did not incorporate other clinical examinations and laboratory indicators. Therefore, while our information can be used to predict the likelihood of spontaneous closure and guide treatment options, it cannot provide an accurate diagnosis.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^1131hm3L]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Whether the position of m‐VSD affects the probability potential for spontaneous closure remains debatable. The results of this study indicated that the spontaneous closure of m‐VSD is independent of the position of the defect, which is in line with published reports. We observed that the incidence rate of mid‐muscular VSD, which is the most common position for m‐VSD, was 60% with a spontaneous closure rate of 66%. The spontaneous closure rate of apical defects was 67%, higher than the mid‐muscular VSD and the apical VSD. This is contrary to previous reports which showed that apical VSD and anterior VSD persisted longer than mid‐muscular VSD. Possible reasons for this disparity are differences in follow‐up time, diagnostic criteria, and ethnicity.

### Outcomes of a modified approach to transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^1152DNGj]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

To describe the immediate and midterm results of a modified method for transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pmVSDs). Transcatheter closure of pmVSDs has been associated with the development of heart block due to impingement on the ventricular conduction system. Ventricular septal aneurysms (VSAs) are common; the VSA tissue can serve as a target for the device without necessitating direct contact with the conduction system.

Between 2004 and 2011, 15 patients underwent transcatheter closure of a pmVSD utilizing a device implanted into a VSA. Catheterization reports were examined in addition to pre-closure, post-closure, and clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic data. The median age was 20 years (4–61 years), and the most common indication for closure was increasing LV dilation. Four different Amplatzer devices were utilized.

Following device implantation, there was a decrease in Qp:Qs (1.7–1.1) and in RV:LV pressure ratio (0.36–0.31). There were no deaths, no device embolizations, and no new heart block or PR interval prolongation. Three patients developed a new right bundle branch block (RBBB). The median follow-up time was 1.5 years (4 months to 7.1 years). Two patients required further procedures for important residual shunting. Six continued to have a "trivial/small" residual leak, but only one had any degree (mild) of residual LV dilation. None of the complications were significantly associated with age or weight at the time of procedure, original size of the VSD, or size or type of the device.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with congenital heart disease, the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering either ICD placement or electrophysiologic testing with ICD placement for inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias. This recommendation applies to patients with repaired moderate or severe complexity adult congenital heart disease who present with unexplained syncope and at least moderate ventricular dysfunction or marked hypertrophy, provided that meaningful survival of more than one year is expected.

### Predictive scoring system for spontaneous closure of infant ventricular septal defect: The P-VSD score [^115dgU7u]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common congenital heart disease. However, consensus on the utility of echocardiography in predicting the spontaneous closure (SC) of VSD remains lacking. This study aimed to identify and validate significant predictors of SC through a predictive scoring system. This retrospective study included medical records of 712 echocardiography instances performed on 304 patients diagnosed with VSD from 2016 to 2020 in their first year of life. A novel scoring system for predicting the SC of VSD was developed and validated using another dataset from different hospitals.

Of the 304 patients, 215 (70.7%) had perimembranous (PM) VSDs, and 89 (29.3%) had muscular VSDs. The median follow-up periods were 36.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 13–59) for PM VSDs and 13.7 days (IQR, 5–37.4) for muscular VSDs. The overall SC rate during follow-up was 29.3%.

- **Significant risk factors**: Pulmonary hypertension (HTN), concomitant left ventricle (LV)-right atrium (RA) shunt, VSD size to aortic valve (AV) annulus size ratio, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) z-score were significant risk factors affecting the SC of VSD.

- **P-VSD score performance**: The "P-VSD" score, a new scoring system, demonstrated an area under the curve for predictability of 0.769. Pulmonary HTN, concomitant LV-RA shunt, LVEDD z-score, and VSD size-to-AV annulus size ratio at diagnosis were significantly associated with non-SC VSD after infancy.

The P-VSD score can predict the SC of VSD in clinical settings and simplify the identification and appropriate management of high-risk patients.

### Residual shunts following isolated surgical ventricular septal defect closure: risk factors and spontaneous closure [^111JkENF]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although isolated congenital ventricular septal defects (VSD) can be repaired with a high degree of success, residual shunts (RS) are commonplace postoperatively. Small RS are relatively innocuous and tend to spontaneously close with time, despite the emotional burden it poses for the patient and family. A large RS, however, needs ongoing surveillance and may necessitate reintervention.

Factors influencing the incidence of RS, as well as the likelihood and expected timing of its spontaneous closure, are discussed in this study. The patient records and relevant data of 362 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation with isolated congenital VSD closure as the primary procedure between January 2017 and December 2017 were included in the study. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms were performed at hospital discharge, and during follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Residual defects were measured under echocardiogram at every follow-up.

Factors expected to be associated with RS occurrence and spontaneous closure were included for logistic and Cox regression statistical analysis. There were 113 cases where RS occurred according to the first postoperative echocardiograms performed at discharge, of which 80 were confirmed closed during subsequent follow-up, with a median follow-up of 96 days. A cutoff of 1.25 mm for the initial RS was found to be the best predictor of spontaneous closure at the 6-month follow-up. Small shunts had a higher closure rate than larger ones by a follow-up duration of 300 days, at which point the two groups tended to converge.

### Transthoracic device closure of juxtaarterial ventricular septal defects: Midterm follow-up results [^115ixVWx]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, minimally invasive transthoracic device closure has been introduced as an alternative treatment option for selected patients with juxtaarterial ventricular septal defects. This study evaluated the midterm safety and efficacy of using device closure in selected patients.

- **Methods**: Between January 2008 and December 2014, 25 patients with juxtaarterial ventricular septal defects who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Periventricular closure was attempted using minimally invasive transthoracic device closure without cardiopulmonary bypass under general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography guidance. Patients were strictly monitored according to a standard protocol by one specially appointed doctor.

- **Results**: Minimally invasive transthoracic device closure was successfully performed in 23 patients (92%) with a median age of 18 months. Device closure failed in 2 patients (1 with aortic regurgitation and 1 with right ventricular outflow tract stenosis), and they were converted to an open operation. No severe complications (device shift, significant arrhythmia, ventricular outflow tract obstruction, or obvious valve regurgitation) were observed. There was no closure-associated valve regurgitation. No patient had worrisome progression of aortic regurgitation or pulmonary regurgitation.

- **Conclusions**: In select patients, minimally invasive transthoracic device closure of juxtaarterial ventricular septal defects appears to be safe and effective, with good midterm outcomes.

### Pharmacologic exposure of an occult atrial septal defect [^115zJJ8f]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This case report describes the diagnostic technique used to identify the presence of a symptomatic interatrial shunt obscured by normal intracardiac pressures. It discusses the unusual findings in this case and their relevance to the investigation of patients with unexplained hypoxemia.

The setting was the intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital, involving a patient with a variant of the platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. The patient underwent an intervention involving the intravenous administration of metaraminol.

Clinical examination and routine investigations ruled out pneumonia or myocardial infarction as the cause of respiratory failure. Additionally, pulmonary angiography was normal, except for the demonstration of an interatrial communication. Repeated transthoracic echocardiograms failed to indicate the presence of a significant interatrial shunt. This shunt was eventually detected following a temporary shunt reversal with intravenous metaraminol and confirmation by bubble-contrast transesophageal echocardiography and right heart catheter studies.

The study concludes that a symptomatic right-to-left intracardiac shunt may occur in patients with normal intracardiac and pulmonary artery pressures. The presence of a significant shunt cannot be ruled out by transthoracic echocardiography without the use of bubble contrast.

### Real-time evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of atrial septal defect closure in adults with left ventricular dysfunction [^111NGjev]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2005). Low credibility.

Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects with left-to-right shunt induces an abrupt overload of the left ventricle that may cause acute heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We report two cases of ostium secundum atrial septal defects associated with left ventricular dysfunction of different etiology. The hemodynamic evaluation of left ventricular function during transient abolition of the shunt with the sizing balloon of the Amplatzer system helped to establish the most correct therapeutic strategy.

### Surgical repair of ventricular septal defect; contemporary results and risk factors for a complicated course [^116mHUSP]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

All patients who underwent surgical closure of a simple ventricular septal defect (VSD) between March 1, 2004, and December 31, 2012, at the Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands, were retrospectively reviewed. A simple VSD was defined as an isolated VSD or a VSD with concomitant atrial septal defect/patent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus, or mildly stenotic/regurgitant semilunar valves. VSD closure was the main indication for surgical intervention in all patients. Patients with prior pulmonary artery banding were also included. Patients with more complex cardiac anomalies, including atrioventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, severe stenosis or insufficiency of the semilunar valves, and tetralogy of Fallot, were excluded. Medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed with permission from the institutional review board of the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Two hundred forty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. We collected preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data from the echocardiography reports, perfusion reports, clinic, inpatient, and operative notes for all the patients. Outcomes were assessed through the latest postoperative visit before inclusion. All patients that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed.

The preoperative characteristics included sex, gestational age, birth weight, cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidity, age at operation, body weight at operation, days in hospital preoperatively, days ventilated preoperatively, type of VSD, and indication for surgery.

### β-blockers in postoperative myocardial diastolic dysfunction: not a panacea [^115wpKv4]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Successful treatment with heart rate-lowering medication has been used to treat adults with chronic myocardial dysfunction of various etiologies for several years. Recent evidence suggests the successful use of β-receptor blocking medication in a highly selected group of infants with diastolic myocardial dysfunction. This case series demonstrates that while β-receptor blockers in infants early following the initial treatment of congenital left heart obstructive lesions appear to be a promising and safe adjunct to more conventional management, the medium-term and long-term care of these patients remains as challenging as before.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^113xhMJA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) belongs to the simple types of congenital cardiac defects, with good surgical results for hemodynamically significant lesions and subsequent discharge from further follow-up. Treatment of patients with small, insignificant defects is conservative, and following visits in outpatient clinics for the first two decades of life, patients are usually discharged from further follow-up, although no clear consensus on this area exists. According to some earlier guidelines, neither surgically closed nor small unrepaired defects require continuous follow-up at specialized centers, reflecting that late outcome is generally considered benign. However, there is a paucity of data investigating long-term outcomes in these patients. The true burden of late morbidity may not become manifest until later in life.

Our research group has previously demonstrated a number of abnormal outcomes when young adults with congenital VSDs were compared with healthy peers. Young adults with surgically closed VSDs display impaired ventricular contractility, compromised ventilatory response, and reduced cardiac output during exercise, as well as decreased heart rate variability and altered pulmonary function at rest. Moreover, both surgically closed and unrepaired VSDs have demonstrated lower functional capacity and abnormal biventricular morphology during exercise. An increasing number of studies, both clinical and register-based, likewise note a significant burden of cardiovascular events in patients with a congenital VSD.

### What is blocking transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure [^1173vyCM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Our experience is that the vast majority of pmVSD closure is still performed surgically in the United States, and this aligns with HCUPNet data. In 2012, approximately 3,145 surgical VSD closures were performed in children (ICD‐9 procedure codes 35.62 [with tissue graft] and 35.53 [with device/synthetic material]; 1,707 ± 230 and 1,438 ± 191 cases, respectively). According to these data, VSD closure is performed surgically approximately 98% of the time in the United States, compared to around 60 catheter‐based closures annually.

There may be path‐specific factors driving distinct evolution of practice in different countries. For example, if there was a major difference in surgical outcomes, the appeal of catheter closure would rightly differ. Likewise, it may be easier to rationalize a catheter procedure than an open operation in the setting of borderline or questionable indications. The broader indications for VSD closure in the Chinese context also confound interpretation when considering how these data apply to the United States and other countries. It is plausible that those with small shunts (e.g. attributable to partial closure by tricuspid valve tissue) have a lower risk of complications, and the risk for the cohort who would undergo closure in the United States could be substantially higher. However, with recent data, including the Report, it is increasingly believable that the risks of transcatheter closure are likely to be about the same or lower than for surgery in many scenarios.

As always, "questions remain". Why has catheter VSD closure not been more widely adopted in the United States?

### Minimally invasive closure of transthoracic ventricular septal defect: Postoperative complications and risk factors [^116EuHU5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, accounting for about 20% of congenital heart disease. Treatment methods for VSD include repair under cardiopulmonary bypass, minimally invasive closure of transthoracic VSD, and interventional closure by percutaneous puncture. In recent years, minimally invasive closure of transthoracic VSD has been widely used in China. This procedure is suitable for almost all patients as it does not require cardiopulmonary bypass, has small surgical incisions, allows quick postoperative recovery, involves no X-ray exposure, and has wider indications than interventional closure. It has been increasingly recognized by clinicians and patients/parents.

Chen's research involving 1,090 patients undergoing this procedure is the largest report to date. However, no studies have specifically summarized the postoperative complications and corresponding risk factors of this operation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the complications of minimally invasive closure of transthoracic VSD in a short-term single-center cohort and to determine the corresponding risk factors.

### Current expectations for surgical repair of isolated ventricular septal defects [^115nYvm8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most commonly recognized congenital heart defect. With the development of device closure for intracardiac defects, we sought to evaluate the expectations for surgical closure of isolated VSD.

- **Methods**: Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2006, 215 patients underwent isolated VSD repair at a median age of 10 months (range, 20 days to 18 years) and a median weight of 7 kg (range, 2 to 66 kg). The following VSD types were found: 172 perimembranous (80%), 28 supracristal (13%), 6 inlet (3%), and 9 muscular (4%). One hundred eight patients (50%) had evidence of congestive heart failure or failure to thrive preoperatively. Thirty-one patients (14%) had aortic valve cusp prolapse, and 63 (29%) had genetic abnormalities.

- **Results**: Incidence of significant postoperative complications was extremely low. No patient underwent reoperation for a residual VSD, and none had complete heart block. One operative mortality (0.5%) and two late deaths (0.9%) occurred. Median postoperative hospital length of stay was 5 days (range, 2 to 187 days). In the immediate postoperative period, 6 patients (2.8%) required reoperation. No patients were discharged on antiarrhythmic agents, had complete heart block, or required permanent pacing. At mean follow-up of 2.1 ± 2.0 years, 99.5% (211 of 212) of patients were asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint. None exhibited greater than mild new-onset tricuspid valve regurgitation. No aortic valve injuries occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical closure of isolated VSD is a safe, effective therapy. The risk of death is minimal.

### Percutaneous device closure of congenital isolated ventricular septal defects: A single-center retrospective database study amongst 412 cases [^112rzUno]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

To identify suitable cases and reduce failure/complication rates for percutaneous ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure, we aimed to:

- **Study causes of device failure**: Retrospective data from 412 elective percutaneous VSD closures of isolated congenital VSDs between 2003 and 2017 were analyzed. Out of these, 363 were successfully implanted, in 30 cases device implantation failed, and in 19 cases, the procedure was abandoned.

- **Compare outcomes with different VSD types and devices**: Outcomes were assessed using echocardiography, electrocardiography, and catheterization data (before the procedure, immediately after, and during follow-up). Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess effects of age, VSD type, and device type and size on procedural outcome. The median [interquartile range] age and body surface area were 6.6 [4.1–10.9] years and 0.7 [0.5–1.0] m², respectively. Device failure was not associated with age (p = 0.08), type of VSD (p = 0.5), device type (p = 0.2), or device size (p = 0.1). Device failure occurred in 7.6% of patients. As device type is not related to failure rate and device failure and complication risk were not associated with age, it is justifiable to use financially beneficial ductal devices in the VSD position and to consider closure of VSDs with a device in clinically indicated children.

### SPL drug information for atenolol [^112vaaMb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of atenolol IV (also known as Tenormin) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Consider safer alternatives. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for bradycardia and hypoglycemia. Atenolol IV is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. Due to its pharmacological effects, atenolol has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

Reduction in the risk of stroke: The LIFE study was a multinational, double-blind study comparing losartan and atenolol in 9193 hypertensive patients with ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within six months prior to randomization were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive once daily losartan 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg. If the goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) was not reached, hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added first, and if needed, the dose of losartan or atenolol was then increased to 100 mg once daily. If necessary, other antihypertensive treatments (e.g. increase in dose of hydrochlorothiazide therapy to 25 mg or addition of other diuretic therapy, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents, but not ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, or beta-blockers) were added to the treatment regimen to reach the goal blood pressure.

In efforts to control blood pressure, the patients in both arms of the LIFE study were coadministered hydrochlorothiazide the majority of time they were on study drug (73.9% and 72.4% of days in the losartan and atenolol arms, respectively).

Of the randomized patients, 4963 (54%) were female, and 533 (6%) were Black. The mean age was 67 with 5704 (62%) age ≥ 65. At baseline, 1195 (13%) had diabetes, 1326 (14%) had isolated systolic hypertension, 1469 (16%) had coronary heart disease, and 728 (8%) had cerebrovascular disease. Baseline mean blood pressure was 174/98 mmHg in both treatment groups. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years.

### Patent foramen ovale and ventricular septal defect closure [^116VKy47]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the growing recognition of the patent foramen ovale (PFO), particularly when associated with an atrial septal aneurysm as a risk factor for several disease manifestations — above all paradoxical embolism — the optimal treatment strategy for symptomatic patients remains controversial. Percutaneous PFO closure is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed with high success and low morbidity. For the secondary prevention of recurrent embolic events, it appears to be clinically at least as effective as oral anticoagulation.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most common congenital heart defects. Percutaneous VSD closure is more intricate than PFO closure and is associated with a significant risk of both peri-interventional and mid-term complications. In suitable patients with congenital VSD, device closure may be the preferred treatment for both muscular or perimembranous VSDs and for residual defects after surgical VSD closure. The risk of complete atrioventricular conduction block remains a concern in the perimembranous group.

The history, technique, and clinical role of percutaneous PFO and VSD closure are discussed, with an emphasis on problems and future developments.

### Health-related quality of life in adults undergoing transthoracic device closure of ventricular septal defect [^111tAJA6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Comparisons between different age groups were made in the case group. In addition to "role-emotional" and "mental health" (p = 0.003), scores for most items tended to decline with age. In particular, the scores of patients over 50 years old in the three dimensions of "role-physical" (p < 0.01), "vitality" (p < 0.01), and "bodily pain" (p = 0.003) were significantly lower than those of the younger patients, whereas the scores of the older patients in the fields of "role-emotional" and "mental health" (p = 0.003) were more positive.

- **Gender comparison**: In the comparison between males and females, no significant gender differences in scores were noted for most dimensions, with the exception that males were more positive in the fields of "role-physical" (p = 0.01) and "vitality" (p = 0.003).

- **Marital status comparison**: In the comparison between the married group and the single group, except for the fields of "role-emotional" (p < 0.01) and "vitality" (p = 0.023) in which the married group was more positive, no significant differences were noted between the married group and the single group in other fields.

### Combined catheter ventricular septal defect closure and multivessel coronary stenting to treat postmyocardial infarction ventricular septal defect and triple-vessel coronary artery disease: a case report [^115yuLjr]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect following acute myocardial infarction is a rare but life-threatening complication. Early surgical closure improves survival but carries a considerable risk. Percutaneous transcatheter closure is an alternative; however, experience at the time of writing is limited. We report a case of successful transcatheter closure of postmyocardial infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) in a 55-year-old male with the Amplatzer muscular VSD occluder device. This was combined with complete percutaneous revascularization and successful multivessel coronary stenting for three-vessel disease as a staged procedure. The technique and its potential use as an alternative to the surgical approach for treatment of acute myocardial infarction and its complication (VSD) are discussed.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^115g4VRD]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Process of spontaneous closure**: Figure 1 illustrates the process of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) in children as observed through echocardiography. The case of a 32-day-old female infant who underwent echocardiography for a heart murmur is highlighted. In panel A, color Doppler echocardiography shows a parasternal long-axis view of a perimembranous defect, originally measuring 4.0 mm in width. By 90 days of age, as seen in panel B, the color Doppler echocardiography revealed a reduction in the defect size in the parasternal short-axis view, measuring 3.1 mm. At 8 months (panel C), the defect further diminished to 2.0 mm. By 14 months, as illustrated in panel D, the defect spontaneously closed, and the heart murmur resolved. Abbreviations used include AO (aortic), LA (left atrium), LV (left ventricular), PA (pulmonary artery), RA (right atrium), RV (right ventricular), and VSD (ventricular septal defect).

- **Statistical analysis of spontaneous closure**: Table 1 presents the differences in results between patients with spontaneous closure of perimembranous VSD and those without. A binary logistic regression analysis identified statistically significant indicators: defect size (P = 0.003), ATVMS (P = 0.005), and LVDD (P = 0.010), which could distinguish between spontaneous closure and non-closure.

	- **Logistic regression model**: A logistic regression model was constructed using these three indicators as independent variables: Logit(P) = 7.143 − 1.438X1 + 1.887X2 − 0.222X3. The likelihood ratio test yielded χ² = 70.187 (P < 0.001), suggesting that the model is statistically sound. With this model, the correct prediction rate of the p-VSD model was 75.7%. The prediction accuracy for spontaneous closure of p-VSD was evaluated using the area under the curve, which was 0.

### Camzyos [^113eUz7T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

At baseline, approximately 73% of the randomized patients were classified as NYHA class II, and 27% were classified as NYHA class III. The mean LVEF was 74%, and the mean Valsalva LVOT gradient was 73 mmHg. About 10% of the patients had prior septal reduction therapy, 75% were on beta-blockers, 17% were on calcium channel blockers, and 14% had a history of atrial fibrillation.

All patients were initiated on CAMZYOS 5 mg (or matching placebo) once daily. The dose was periodically adjusted to optimize patient response by decreasing the LVOT gradient with the Valsalva maneuver and to maintain an LVEF ≥ 50%. The dosing was also informed by plasma concentrations of CAMZYOS.

In the CAMZYOS group, at the end of treatment, 49% of patients were receiving the 5-mg dose, 33% were receiving the 10-mg dose, and 11% were receiving the 15-mg dose. Three patients temporarily interrupted their dose due to LVEF < 50%; of these, two resumed treatment at the same dose, and one had the dose reduced from 10 mg to 5 mg.

- **Primary endpoint**: The primary composite functional endpoint, assessed at 30 weeks, was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved either an improvement of peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) by ≥ 1.5 mL/kg/min plus an improvement in NYHA class by at least 1, or an improvement of pVO2 by ≥ 3.0 mL/kg/min with no worsening in NYHA class.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^111rYmDL]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart disease (CHD), accounting for almost 50% of all CHD cases. The estimated prevalence of VSD is 2 to 3.94 per 1000 live births diagnosed by echocardiography. Two-dimensional (2D) combined color Doppler echocardiography facilitates the diagnosis of VSD, allowing for measurement of the defect's size and position, as well as evaluation of its anatomical relationship with surrounding tissue.

The spontaneous closure rate of VSD remains controversial, although it generally closes spontaneously in 12% to 84% of cases. This wide range may be attributed to factors such as age, size, and position of the VSD, diagnostic methods, and the follow-up period. Recent studies focus on describing the incidence and natural history of VSD. Other studies had a short follow-up time.

In this study, patients were followed from infancy up to six years of age, demonstrating the spontaneous closure rate of perimembranous VSD (p-VSD) and muscular VSD (m-VSD). Our aim was to identify predictive factors for the spontaneous closure of VSD and to recommend follow-up criteria to assist pediatricians in selecting the best management scheme for children with VSD.

### Mid-term outcome of left ventricle reverse remodeling after atrial septal defect closure: A comparison between surgical and device groups [^114XxhDo]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) volume overload occurs in patients with significant atrial septal defect (ASD II) shunts, which can impair left ventricle (LV) filling, thus decreasing LV indices. However, after ASD II closure, the left ventricle regains near normal dimensions. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of LV reverse remodeling between device and surgical closure. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiographic data of 222 patients with isolated ASD II who underwent surgical (95 patients) or device closure (127 patients) between January 2012 and December 2017. The ASD II was significantly larger in the surgical closure group (p < 0.001), leading to a higher degree of paradoxical interventricular septal (IVS) movement. In contrast, the LV volume was larger in the device closure group (p < 0.001). After a median follow-up period of 19.5 months, the maximum LV systolic and diastolic volumes were reached at 1 year in the device closure group and 2 years in the surgical closure group. IVS motion normalized in 91% of the device closure group compared to 57% of the surgical closure group (p < 0.001). There was significant improvement in left ventricular indices and IVS motion after ASD II closure in both groups but more favorable in patients after device closure.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^112EBvTr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sympathetic stimulation is necessary for supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade poses the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure.

In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be withdrawn.

- **Renal and hepatic disease and electrolyte disturbances**: Since atenolol is excreted via the kidneys, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.

	- In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Since cumulative effects may develop in the presence of impaired renal function, if progressive renal impairment becomes evident, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be discontinued.

	- In patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, minor alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Atenolol and chlorthalidone should be used with caution in these patients.

- **Ischemic heart disease**: Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease, exacerbations of angina may occur.

### Spontaneous closure rates of ventricular septal defects (6,750 consecutive neonates) [^112Eq9rD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Although ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common and simple congenital heart disease in newborns, its true incidence and spontaneous closure (SC) rate remain topics of controversy. This study aims to provide data on the true incidence and SC rate of VSD in the Chinese neonatal population. We conducted a prospective study at three hospitals where all newborns underwent echocardiography. Those with a diagnosis of isolated VSD were included in the study group and underwent a 7-year follow-up period.

In 6,750 newborns, VSDs were detected in 113 cases, yielding an incidence rate of 16.7% and accounting for 62.8% of congenital heart disease. Among these cases, 35 were perimembranous (5.2%), 72 were muscular (10.7%), and six were doubly committed juxta-arterial (0.9‰). During the 7-year follow-up period, 18 cases required surgical or transcatheter closure. The SC rate for perimembranous VSD and muscular VSD (mVSD) was 51.4% (18 of 35) and 97.2% (70 of 72), respectively. Excluding doubly committed juxta-arterial VSDs, perimembranous site and defects ≥ 4 mm are risk factors for VSDs that do not spontaneously close. Independent predictive factors for perimembranous VSDs that do not spontaneously close include defects ≥ 4 mm. There was no significant difference in the SC rate at different times between the four mVSD sites.

In conclusion, this study provides the true incidence and SC rate for Chinese newborns with VSD.

### Complete heart block associated with device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^113MvtQ6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The development of the Amplatzer Membranous VSD Occluder (AGA Medical Corp, Plymouth, Minn) for the closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects has ameliorated many of the technical difficulties of previous devices. Application of this new technology requires comparative evaluation with the standard of surgical repair. We report our experience of complete heart block associated with device closure of a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect with unequivocal indications for intervention.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of 20 patients between January 2003 and August 2005 who underwent perimembranous ventricular septal defect device closure, 18 with hemodynamically large shunts meeting the surgical criteria for intervention. The median age was 1.6 years (range, 0.5–16.2 years), and the median weight was 9.7 kg (range, 6.2–43 kg).

- **Results**: Acute complete shunt occlusion was achieved in all patients. There were no acute procedural complications. The median follow-up time was 23.1 months (range, 1–37.8 months). Four (22%) patients had complete heart block at 17 days, 4.2 months, 8.8 months, and 37.5 months after implantation, respectively. No risk factors were identified for the development of complete heart block, including age, weight, trisomy 21, preceding conduction abnormalities, perimembranous ventricular septal defect size related to body surface area or device size, and progressive device flattening.

- **Conclusions**: Device closure of large perimembranous ventricular septal defects in infants and children with the Amplatzer Membranous VSD Occluder was evaluated.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^1156DNMp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The overall event-free survival for patients with unrepaired defects was 94% (95% CI, 94%–95%), 91% (95% CI, 90%–92%), 83% (95% CI, 82%–85%), 69% (95% CI, 66%–72%), and 48% (95% CI, 44%–52%) at 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 years of age, respectively. Corresponding estimates for patients with surgically closed defects were 75% (95% CI, 71%–78%), 65% (95% CI, 60%–70%), 53% (95% CI, 46%–60%), 33% (95% CI, 23%–43%), and 19% (95% CI, 9.4%–30%). The cohorts of matched controls for the two patient groups had an event-free survival of 98% (95% CI, 98%–98%) and 97% (95% CI, 96%–98%) at 40 years of age and 90% (95% CI, 89%–91%) and 86% (95% CI, 84%–88%) at 60 years of age, respectively.

Data are graphically illustrated in Figure 3A. Event-free survival truncated at 1 year after either VSD diagnosis (patients with unrepaired defect) or VSD closure (patients with surgically closed defect) is demonstrated in Figure 3B. Event-free survival truncated at 1 year after VSD diagnosis for patients with unrepaired defect was 97% (95% CI, 96–97) and 93% (95% CI, 91–94) at 20- and 40-years of follow-up, respectively. Corresponding estimates for patients with surgically closed VSD 1 year after defect closure were 95% (95% CI, 92–97) and 88% (95% CI, 82–92). The matched controls displayed an event-free survival of 96% (95% CI, 96–97) at 40 years of follow-up. Event-free survival stratified by morbidity (arrhythmia, heart failure, infectious endocarditis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, including death) is embedded in Figure S1.

### Minimally invasive closure of transthoracic ventricular septal defect: Postoperative complications and risk factors [^114QoZxG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

After the child was anesthetized in the operating room, they were positioned supine. The position, size, upper and lower edges of the defect, and the aortic valve were evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography (TTE). A small incision, ranging from 2 to 4 cm, was made in the middle of the skin. For the perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD), the incision was located in front of the lower end of the sternum, and we accessed the mediastinum through the lower part of the sternum. For the subarterial VSD, the incision was made in front of the middle sternum, with the incision pulled to the left to enter the mediastinum through the third intercostal space on the left edge of the sternum. The pericardium was cut and suspended.

After administering heparin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to guide the positioning of the right ventricular surface purse-string suture. A domestic eccentric or equilateral occluder (Shanghai Shape Memory Alloy Co, Ltd) was selected. A trocar was used to puncture the right ventricular wall; the needle core was removed, and under TEE monitoring, a wire was guided from the right ventricle through the ventricular septal defect to the left ventricular cavity. The sheath was placed and the left ventricular surface umbrella disk was released. It was gently pulled back to position the left umbrella disk close to the ventricular septum. The sheath was then retracted into the right ventricular cavity, releasing the occluder waist and right ventricular surface umbrella tray. The mark on the eccentric umbrella disc was positioned far away from the aortic valve annulus. In cases of subatrial ventricular septal defect or if the ventricular septal defect edge was less than 2 mm from the aortic valve annulus, an eccentric occluder was chosen.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^116vsBym]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Overall, patients with VSD had a higher HR of morbidity and a lower event-free survival compared with their matched controls.

The overall HR of heart failure in the total cohort of patients with VSD was 7.4 (95% CI, 6.5–8.5) compared with the total cohort of matched controls. Stratified by treatment, both patients with unrepaired VSD and patients with surgically closed VSD displayed higher HR for heart failure when compared with their corresponding matched controls, demonstrated in Table 2. The HR did not normalize in either subgroup when estimates were truncated at 1 year after surgery or diagnosis; data are presented in Table 3. Adjusted for atrial fibrillation, the HR for heart failure in unrepaired patients was 4.3 (95% CI, 3.6–5.0), and it was 27.7 (95% CI, 19.6–40.0) in surgically closed patients. The HR of heart failure 1 year after surgery in patients in whom defect closure was performed through a right atriotomy (n = 353) was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.1–5.9). Median age at surgical closure for this subpopulation was 237 days (IQR, 109 days–2.3 years), and median age at end of follow-up was 11.4 years (IQR, 5.2–18.8 years).

### The experience of transcatheter closure of postoperative ventricular septal defect after total correction [^117LFZ5L]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Postoperative ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a relatively common finding after the correction of an isolated VSD or complex cardiac anomalies. Postoperative VSD may arise due to patch dehiscence, suture disruption, incomplete closure of the defect, or bacterial endocarditis. The incidence of postoperative VSD varies according to the type of initial defect, ranging from 5 to 25%. Although some of these residual VSDs are restrictive and well-tolerated, they may result in left-to-right shunting, persistent left ventricular volume overload, or pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, postoperative VSDs may require re-intervention.

Rarely, an iatrogenic VSD may form after surgery. VSD closure with fenestration is another cause of postoperative VSD. Surgical repair remains the mainstay of treatment for postoperative residual VSD. A repeat surgical repair procedure (involving cardiopulmonary bypass and sternotomy) is physically and psychologically traumatic for pediatric patients, given the requirement for extracorporeal circulation and risks of myocardial scarring and bleeding.

Transcatheter closure of a postoperative VSD has emerged as a less invasive approach that can be used in selected patients to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with repeated surgical repair. However, few studies have evaluated the transcatheter approach in the treatment of postoperative VSD. Therefore, we reviewed our institutional experience with transcatheter closure of postoperative residual VSDs and report mid-term outcomes.

### 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease [^116Xtb5y]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for patent foramen ovale, especially in patients with Ebstein anomaly, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend considering isolated device closure of atrial septal defect/PFO if cyanosis (oxygen saturation at rest < 90%) is the leading problem. It is essential to perform a careful evaluation before intervention to exclude the induction of an increase in right atrial pressure or a fall in cardiac output.

### Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect preserves right ventricular function [^115HQGKp]. Heart (2002). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of atrial septal defects (ASD) and their closure on systolic and diastolic right and left ventricular function; and by comparing surgical closure with transcatheter device closure, to establish differences attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.

- **Design**: Cross-sectionally guided M mode echocardiographic ventricular long axis function was measured prospectively before and within one week after ASD closure by device in 17 patients and by surgery in 12 patients, and compared with 18 normal subjects.

- **Results**: All indices of right ventricular function were impaired after surgery: mean total excursion, -1.89 cm (95% confidence interval (CI), -2.18 to -1.59); peak shortening rate, -9.09 cm/s (-10.82 to -7.35); peak lengthening rate, -9.26 cm/s (-11.09 to -7.43). Total excursion and peak lengthening rate were preserved after device closure, at -0.12 cm (-0.28 to 0.05) and 0.01 cm/s (-2.29 to 2.31), respectively. Left ventricular free wall function was unchanged after closure by either method, while all septal measurements were reduced after closure by either method (changes ranging from -3.51 to -0.32; 95% CI ranging from -4.90 to -0.13).

- **Conclusions**: Left ventricular free wall function is unaffected by ASD closure, whereas septal function is impaired, irrespective of the method of closure. Right ventricular function, both systolic and diastolic, is impaired by cardiopulmonary bypass but preserved after device closure. These findings support the transcatheter approach to ASD closure in anatomically suitable defects.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^1111t44b]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Although the high rate of spontaneous closure was satisfying, there is currently no simple and systematic way to predict the spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects (VSD). Therefore, it is essential to identify predictors of spontaneous closure. According to our analysis, defect size, ATVMS formation, and left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDD) are characteristic and representative predictors.

Our study showed that defect size is one of the key factors affecting the spontaneous closure of VSD. For examinations at the same age, the smaller the defect, the easier it is to close spontaneously. The spontaneous closure rate of small perimembranous VSD (p‐VSD) was 83%, and small muscular VSD (m‐VSD) was 80%. Our results are consistent with other studies, indicating that the spontaneous closure probability of small defects is much higher than larger ones.

- **ATVMS formation**: ATVMS formation is an important factor in the spontaneous closure of p‐VSD. It has been reported that the rate of ATVMS formation ranges from 46% to 81%, with significant variation depending on the study population. In our study, ATVMS formation was detected in 72% of patients with p‐VSD, and the rate of spontaneous closure reached up to 70% in cases with ATVMS. Although the mechanism is still unclear, there are reports that ATVMS formation limits left‐to‐right shunting and may result in partial or complete closure of VSD.

- **LVDD as a negative predictor**: LVDD is a negative predictor of spontaneous closure, associated with an unfavorable VSD prognosis. Our study showed that the LVDD in cases of spontaneous closure was smaller than in cases of no closure. This indicates that left‐to‐right shunting was substantial, and the ventricular volume overload resulted in left ventricular enlargement.
