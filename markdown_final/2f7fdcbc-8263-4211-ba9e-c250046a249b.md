## Question

Should I switch from amoxicillin to clavulin in acute otitis media complicated by tympanic perforation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to switch from amoxicillin to amoxicillin–clavulanate (Clavulin/Augmentin) for acute otitis media complicated by tympanic membrane perforation with otorrhea, and what the evidence-based rationale and dosing should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its microbiology. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications for adding beta-lactamase coverage. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin–clavulanate in AOM with otorrhea. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and formulation nuances. Finally, I should consider alternatives if amoxicillin–clavulanate is not tolerated and outline follow-up and reassessment plans.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. Acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation and otorrhea (AOMd) represents a more severe phenotype of AOM, with higher rates of persistent pain/fever at 3–7 days and more recurrences and hearing problems than AOM without discharge, which strengthens the case for prompt, effective antibiotic therapy rather than observation in this subgroup [^1143rHg1] [^115wxTiS].

> I need to check the likely pathogens and resistance patterns. In AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis predominate; importantly, nearly all M. catarrhalis and a substantial proportion of H. influenzae produce beta-lactamase, and beta-lactamase–producing strains are enriched in AOM with otorrhea, which undermines amoxicillin monotherapy and supports adding clavulanate for reliable coverage [^111f53kK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify guideline triggers for broader coverage. The AAP/AAFP guideline advises amoxicillin–clavulanate when additional beta-lactamase coverage is needed, including after recent amoxicillin exposure, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin; AOM with otorrhea is commonly grouped among scenarios warranting enhanced coverage, and Italian guidance explicitly recommends high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate as first-line in children with AOM and ear discharge, aligning with this approach [^115Sosyg] [^112PEiiR] [^115EmKpe].

> Next, I should review direct and indirect efficacy data. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in AOM with otorrhea. Individual patient data meta-analyses show antibiotics are most beneficial in children under 2 years with bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea, with an NNT around 3 for symptom resolution, and randomized data in tube otorrhea demonstrate faster resolution with amoxicillin–clavulanate than placebo, supporting the biological plausibility that adding clavulanate improves outcomes when beta-lactamase producers are likely [^1137FsEi] [^116sjhqj] [^1143rHg1].

> I should confirm the recommended dosing and formulation. For children, high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate using the 14:1 ratio (amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day with clavulanate 6.4 mg/kg/day) in two divided doses is preferred to maximize pneumococcal killing while minimizing clavulanate-related gastrointestinal adverse effects; the 7:1 ratio is acceptable if the 14:1 product is unavailable, though it delivers more clavulanate per amoxicillin dose and may increase diarrhea risk [^112PEiiR] [^114HRxCA] [^111oa2Bf].

> Let me consider duration and age. I initially thought a 10-day course is always required, but wait, I should double-check current guidance. For children under 2 years or with severe disease, a 10-day course is recommended; for children 2 years and older without severe features, 5–7 days is acceptable, though many clinicians extend to 7–10 days when otorrhea is present given the higher burden and risk of persistent effusion, so I should individualize by age and severity while ensuring close follow-up [^115Yp3Xe].

> But wait, what if amoxicillin–clavulanate is not tolerated due to diarrhea or vomiting. I need to ensure I have reasonable alternatives. If beta-lactamase coverage is still desired and oral therapy is needed, cefdinir or cefuroxime are acceptable alternatives with good activity against beta-lactamase–producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, though pneumococcal coverage is somewhat less robust than high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate; ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg IM/IV once daily for 1–3 days) is another option, particularly if adherence is uncertain or vomiting precludes oral therapy [^1155Vw1L] [^114HRxCA].

> I should confirm follow-up and reassessment plans. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve by 48–72 hours, I need to reassess the diagnosis, consider tympanocentesis if available, and switch therapy. Persistent otorrhea beyond 7–10 days should prompt ENT evaluation for complications or alternative diagnoses, and I must remember that analgesia remains essential regardless of antibiotic choice [^115y988r] [^113y75pc] [^117JTqVo].

> Putting this together, I should switch to amoxicillin–clavulanate now. The presence of otorrhea signals a higher likelihood of beta-lactamase–producing pathogens and a greater benefit from antibiotics, and guideline-concordant therapy is high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate using the 14:1 formulation at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided twice daily for 7–10 days based on age and severity, with close follow-up to ensure clinical response and to manage adverse effects [^112PEiiR] [^1143rHg1] [^115Yp3Xe].

Switch to **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for AOM with tympanic perforation because it provides β-lactamase coverage against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are common in this setting [^111f53kK]. High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, in two divided doses) is recommended for 7–10 days [^112PEiiR]. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, use cefdinir or ceftriaxone; avoid macrolides due to lower efficacy [^1155Vw1L] [^11587PSf]. Reassess at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, consider tympanocentesis or alternative therapy [^115y988r].

---

## Rationale for switching to amoxicillin-clavulanate

Amoxicillin-clavulanate **adds clavulanate**, a β-lactamase inhibitor, to amoxicillin, expanding activity to β-lactamase–producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis — common in AOM with perforation [^111oa2Bf]. Guidelines recommend amoxicillin-clavulanate when β-lactamase coverage is needed, such as with recent amoxicillin use, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin [^115Sosyg] [^112o3Edr].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting amoxicillin-clavulanate

- **RCT evidence**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate reduces treatment failure and need for rescue therapy versus placebo in AOM, including cases with otorrhea [^1142CsAh] [^117QLcdx].
- **Microbiologic efficacy**: High-dose regimens achieve high eradication rates for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, including β-lactamase producers [^111f53kK] [^116avFi8].
- **Perforation-specific data**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate shortens otorrhea duration and improves clinical outcomes in AOM with perforation or tympanostomy tubes [^116sjhqj] [^116DYCfF].

---

## Recommended dosing and duration

High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is **90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component** (6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate) in two divided doses for 7–10 days [^112PEiiR] [^114HRxCA]. This regimen balances efficacy with tolerability, as higher clavulanate doses increase gastrointestinal adverse effects.

---

## Alternative antibiotic options

If amoxicillin-clavulanate is not tolerated or contraindicated, consider:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Coverage** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cefdinir | 14 mg/kg/day once daily or divided twice daily | - Good activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis <br/> - Limited S. pneumoniae coverage | Well tolerated; avoid if severe penicillin allergy |
| Ceftriaxone | 50 mg/kg IM/IV once daily (1–3 days) | Broad coverage, including β-lactamase producers | Useful if oral therapy not feasible; monitor for injection-site reactions |
| Azithromycin | 10 mg/kg/day once daily for 3 days | Limited S. pneumoniae activity | Reserve for severe penicillin allergy; higher failure risk [^11587PSf] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

Switching to amoxicillin-clavulanate **improves clinical cure**, reduces treatment failure, and shortens otorrhea duration compared with amoxicillin alone [^notfound]. Risks include gastrointestinal adverse effects (diarrhea, nausea) and rare hypersensitivity; monitor closely and adjust therapy if needed [^1142CsAh].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Reassess at **48–72 hours**; if there is no improvement, consider tympanocentesis or alternative therapy [^115y988r]. Persistent perforation or recurrent AOM may require ENT referral for tympanostomy or further evaluation [^114KJyqh].

---

Switching to **amoxicillin-clavulanate** is recommended for AOM with tympanic perforation because it covers β-lactamase–producing pathogens. Use high-dose, two-divided-dose therapy for 7–10 days, reassess at 48–72 hours, and consider alternatives if needed.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114Lzcn9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — diagnosis and initial observation research priorities — states there will probably never be a gold standard for diagnosis of AOM because of the continuum from otitis media with effusion (OME) to AOM, and performing tympanocentesis studies on children with uncomplicated otitis is likely not feasible because of ethical and other considerations. Devices that more accurately identify the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) and bulging that are easier to use than tympanometry during office visits would be welcome, with additional development of inexpensive, easy-to-use video pneumatic otoscopes still a goal. For less certain tympanic membrane (TM) appearances, randomized controlled trials could clarify the benefit of initial antibiotics and initial observation, and such studies must also specify severity of illness, laterality, and otorrhea, establish appropriate end points, and, when TM appearance is unimproved, require randomization to continued observation and antibiotic groups. The most efficient and acceptable methods of initial observation should continue to be studied balancing the convenience and benefits with the potential risks to the patient.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112w6nwW]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial in children 6 to 23 months — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — reported symptom resolution, failure, and adverse events with quantified effects. Included in the study were 291 patients 6 to 23 months of age: 144 in the antibiotic group and 147 in the placebo group. Initial resolution (AOM-SOS score 0 or 1) with amoxicillin-clavulanate occurred in 35% by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7, versus 28%, 54%, and 74% with placebo (P = .14). For sustained resolution (second of 2 successive AOM-SOS 0 or 1), values were 20% by day 2, 41% at day 4, and 67% at day 7 with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = .04). Treatment failure occurred by day 4 to 5 in 4% with antimicrobial treatment versus 23% with placebo (P < .001) and at day 10 to 12 in 16% versus 51% (NNT = 2.9, P < .001). By day 10 to 12, clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 9% with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 41% with placebo (RD, 32%; NNT = 3), and in bilateral AOM was 23% versus 60% (RD, 37%; NNT = 3). Most common adverse events were diarrhea (25% vs 15%; p = 0.05) and diaper dermatitis (51% vs 35%; p = 0.008), and one placebo recipient developed mastoiditis.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

Nasopharyngeal outcomes during therapy [see Additional Files 3 and 4]

Over the course of the RCT, fewer amoxicillin swabs (59%) than placebo swabs (78%) were positive for pneumococcus (adjusted risk ratio = 0.77 [0.67, 0.88] p = 0.000). Recovery of NCHi was ~70% in each group. There were non-significant differences in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes (42% versus 48% in amoxicillin and placebo swabs, respectively, data not shown) and M. catarrhalis (85% versus 90%). Fewer amoxicillin swabs cultured all 3 pathogens simultaneously (46% versus 58%), but this was not statistically significant (adjusted risk ratio = 0.64 [0.34, 1.23] p = 0.183). During therapy, children in the amoxicillin group also carried fewer penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (34% versus 40% in amoxicillin and placebo, respectively), and fewer macrolide non-susceptible (16% versus 20%, data not shown) and multi-drug resistant (15% versus 20%, data not shown) pneumococci. Beta-lactamase producing NCHi were detected more often in amoxicillin (10%) than placebo (5%) swabs; these latter differences did not reach statistical significance. Tables S2b and S3b give more detail of carriage status over the course of the trial [see Additional Files 3 and 4].

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

Antibiotic treatment

Six children were known to be receiving antibiotics effective against respiratory pathogens at the time of the initial AOM diagnosis (amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day). All the other children had received antibiotics for otitis media in the past but the time since their last treatment was not recorded. Following diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started in an additional 22 children. Two of the three children not treated initially developed moderate bulging of the TM and started treatment on day 6–8 (A31 and A32). One child (A19) did not receive any antibiotics. The antibiotics prescribed were twice daily amoxicillin (25), amoxicillin-clavulanate (1), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (3), or daily intramuscular procaine penicillin (1). The mean dose of penicillin or amoxicillin was 52 mg/kg/day (standard deviation 15, range 25–100). Recommended treatment duration was at least 7 days for AOM without perforation and at least 14 days for AOM with perforation. Compliance with prescribed treatment was poor. Overall, we documented 462/1151 prescribed doses (40%) as taken, and estimated that 17/30 participants (57%) took less than half their recommended treatment.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, regimens, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- receipt of amoxicillin in the last 30 days

- presence of concurrent purulent conjunctivitis

- history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^1134yM7r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1950 to March week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for 'other' bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115y988r]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic treatment failure in AOM — monitoring and next steps are as follows: When antibiotics are prescribed, clinical improvement should be noted within 48 to 72 hours; during the 24 hours after diagnosis symptoms may worsen slightly, then should begin to improve in the next 24 hours, and if initially febrile, temperature should decline within 48 to 72 hours. If the patient is not improved by 48 to 72 hours, reassess for another disease, concomitant viral infection, or resistance. Evidence on clinical–bacteriologic correlation is mixed, with some studies reporting good correlation ranging from 86% to 91% and others reporting sterile middle ear fluid in 42% to 49% of cases. A change in antibiotic may not be required in some children with mild persistent symptoms; however, in children with persistent, severe symptoms and unimproved otologic findings after initial treatment, the clinician may consider changing the antibiotic. If initially treated with amoxicillin and failed to improve, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used; patients previously given amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral third-generation cephalosporins may receive intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), and in AOM unresponsive to initial antibiotics, a 3-day course of ceftriaxone has been shown to be better than a 1-day regimen.

Regarding patient education for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to reassess patients in whom symptoms worsen or fail to respond to initial antibiotic treatment within 48–72 hours, and determine whether a change in therapy is needed.

### Increased clinical failures when treating acute otitis media with macrolides: a meta-analysis [^11587PSf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Macrolide antibiotics are often used to treat children with acute otitis media (AOM); however, the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines recommend against their use in patients without history of a type I allergic reaction to penicillins.

Objective

To evaluate via meta-analysis the comparative efficacy of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate to that of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of children with AOM.

Methods

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts was conducted from the earliest available date through September 2008. We used the following MeSH and key words: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, Augmentin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, macrolides, AND media, otitis media, and effusion. Included studies were randomized, blinded, and controlled trials evaluating guideline-recommended antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate) compared to macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin or clarithromycin) in AOM in children. The primary outcome assessed was clinical failure measured between days 10 and 16 after starting antibiotic therapy. Results are reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals and were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 10 trials (N = 2766) evaluating children 6 months-15 years old were included in the meta-analysis. Upon meta-analysis, the use of macrolide antibiotics was associated with an increased risk of clinical failure (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.60]; p = 0.008) corresponding to a number needed to harm of 32. Upon safety analysis, rates of any adverse reaction (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.90]; p = 0.003) and diarrhea (RR 0.41 [95% CI 0.32 to 0.52]; p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the macrolide group.

Conclusions

The meta-analysis suggests that patients treated with macrolides for AOM may be more likely to have clinical failures. As such, it supports the current AAP AOM recommendation that macrolides be reserved for patients who can not receive amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Acute otitis media — alternative initial antibiotics and comparative in vitro activity: Alternative initial antibiotics include cefdinir (14 mg/kg per day in 1 or 2 doses), cefuroxime (30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), cefpodoxime (10 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), or ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, administered intramuscularly). Alternative antibiotics vary in their efficacy against AOM pathogens, with in vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefdinir and cefuroxime 70% to 80% compared with 84% to 92% for amoxicillin, and in vitro efficacy against Haemophilus influenzae approximately 98% for cefdinir and cefuroxime compared with 58% for amoxicillin and nearly 100% for amoxicillin-clavulanate; additionally, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy.

### Acute and chronic otitis media [^111Vms3B]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common illness in young children. OM has historically been associated with frequent and severe complications. Nowadays it is usually a mild condition that often resolves without treatment. For most children, progression to tympanic membrane perforation and chronic suppurative OM is unusual (low-risk populations); this has led to reevaluation of many interventions that were used routinely in the past. Evidence from a large number of randomized controlled trials can help when discussing treatment options with families. Indigenous children in the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand experience more OM than other children. In some places, Indigenous children continue to suffer from the most severe forms of the disease. Communities with more than 4% of the children affected by chronic tympanic membrane perforation have a major public health problem (high-risk populations). Higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and chronic suppurative lung disease (including bronchiectasis) are also seen. These children will often benefit from effective treatment of persistent (or recurrent) bacterial infection.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^114cdBGX]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This retrospective analysis of electronic medical record (EMR) data was performed among 135 care locations across two, large academic centers (Vanderbilt University Medical Center [VUMC] and Washington University). Both centers use Epic (Verona, WI) for their EMR. Both centers have robust inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs and VUMC has a robust outpatient antimicrobial stewardship program. At VUMC, medical directors of outpatient clinics received quarterly, clinic-level feedback on antibiotic choice for AOM during this period. Feedback on antibiotic duration for AOM was added in Q3 2021. Washington University did not have a formal outpatient antimicrobial stewardship program, but there were informal educational sessions held ad hoc at outpatient sites.

We included outpatient (emergency department [ED], urgent care, primary care clinic, or retail clinic) in-person or telehealth encounters for children ages 2–17 years (inclusive) in 135 sites of care that occurred from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2022, with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems -10 (ICD-10) diagnosis of AOM. ICD-10 codes for AOM were defined as H65.X (any "nonsuppurative otitis media"), H66.X (any "suppurative otitis media and unspecified otitis media"), H67.X (any "otitis media in diseases classified elsewhere"), or H72.X (any "perforation of tympanic membrane"). We included encounters with an ICD-10 code of H65.X (any "nonsuppurative otitis media") to ensure that we did not miss true AOM cases given the risk for miscoding or misclassification by clinicians. Any visit with an ICD-10 diagnosis of AOM occurring more than 30 days after the initial visit was abstracted and analyzed as an independent event (ie, a new episode of AOM). We excluded patients with alternate or competing bacterial diagnoses using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Tiers 1 and 2 diagnoses, for which antibiotics are always or sometimes indicated. We additionally excluded encounters for patients who had received an antibiotic within 30 days prior to the index visit and patients with history of tympanostomy tubes prior to the encounter date. We performed a subanalysis of antibiotic choice and duration by diagnosis code and patient age group (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years) to evaluate for differences in treatment choice and duration.

### Otitis media: rapid evidence review… [^115Yp3Xe]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

If antibiotics are used for AOM, high-dose amoxicillin is first-line therapy, unless the child has taken antibiotics for AOM in the previous 30 days, has purulent conjunctivitis, or has a penicillin allergy. 7 Observation for 48 to 72 hours with deferment of antibiotics should be considered in lower-risk children with AOM. 7, 10 Amoxicillin/clavulanate should be the initial antibiotic for children who have taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or who have purulent conjunctivitis. 7 Single-dose intramuscular ceftriaxone is as effective as amoxicillin for isolated episodes of AOM. However, ceftriaxone should not be used as a first-line treatment, because there are limited options if treatment fails. 7 Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy.

Antibiotic treatment failure is defined as diagnosis of AOM in the 30 days following treatment initiation or severe symptoms that do not resolve within 48 to 72 hours of treatment initiation and unimproved findings on tympanic membrane examination. 7 Lack of resolution of AOM is likely secondary to beta-lactamase–producing H. influenzaeor M. catarrhalis; amoxicillin/clavulanate should be used for treatment if amoxicillin fails. 7 Duration of therapy is based on patient age and severity of symptoms. A 10-day course of antibiotics is recommended if the child is younger than two years or has severe symptoms. A five- to seven-day course is effective if the child is two years or older and does not have severe symptoms. Special Considerations for Adults Treatment of AOM in adults is largely extrapolated from studies of treatment in children, with amoxicillin as the recommended first-line antibiotic. There are no data on observation instead of treatment in adults with AOM.

Therefore, adults should be treated with antibiotics at initial presentation to prevent complications. Adults with recurrent AOM or otitis media with effusion that persists for more than six weeks should be referred to an otolaryngologist to be evaluated for mechanical eustachian tube obstruction. 4.

### Randomized, investigator-blinded, multicenter study of gatifloxacin versus amoxicillin / clavulanate treatment of recurrent and nonresponsive otitis media in children [^112DggeY]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Decreased susceptibility of pathogens to currently used agents for recurrent otitis media has provided the impetus for identifying new antimicrobial options.

Objective

To compare gatifloxacin with amoxicillin/clavulanate in children with recurrent or nonresponsive acute otitis media (AOM).

Methods

Included in this multicenter randomized trial were 413 patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 7 years, who had recurrent AOM (at least 3 episodes in the previous 6 months or 4 episodes in the previous 12 months) and/or had failed antibiotic therapy for AOM within 14 days of enrollment. Diagnosis required evidence of acute inflammation and otoscopic findings of middle ear effusion; baseline tympanocentesis was optional and encouraged. Children were randomly assigned (2:1) to 10 days of oral therapy with gatifloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg of body weight once daily) or amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension (45/6.4 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses).

Results

Clinical cure was obtained in 90.2% (222 of 246) of patients in the gatifloxacin group and 84.3% (102 of 121) of those in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group (95% confidence interval, -1.9–12.9) 3–10 days after treatment ended. Gatifloxacin was associated with higher clinical cure rates than was amoxicillin/clavulanate in children younger than 2 years of age (92.0% versus 80.0%, respectively). Cure rates by pretreatment pathogen in the gatifloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate groups were 92.1% (35 of 38) versus 88.9% (16 of 18) for Streptococcus pneumoniae infections and 88.2% (30 of 34) versus 92.3% (12 of 13) for Haemophilus influenzae infections, respectively. Sustained clinical cures 3–4 weeks after treatment ended were obtained in 74.4% (183 of 246) of patients treated with gatifloxacin and 72.7% (88 of 121) of those treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Adverse events considered drug-related occurred with similar frequency in the 2 groups. Six patients (2.2%) in the gatifloxacin group and 2 patients (1.5%) in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group developed transient symptoms of mild or moderate arthralgia.

Conclusions

In this comparative evaluation of fluoroquinolone therapy in children with AOM, gatifloxacin was similar in clinical efficacy to amoxicillin/clavulanate 45/6.4 mg/kg/d for treatment of recurrent/nonresponsive infections.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo in acute otitis media — randomized trial outcomes report baseline age distribution, efficacy, and adverse events: in the treatment group, 135 of 161 patients (84%) were younger than 24 months versus 124 of 158 (78%) in placebo; treatment failure occurred in 18.6% versus 44.9% (NNT = 3.8, P < .001), rescue treatment was needed in 6.8% versus 33.5% (P < .001), contralateral AOM developed in 8.2% versus 18.6% (P = .007), and use of analgesic or antipyretic medicine was 84.2% versus 85.9%. Parents of child care attendees on placebo missed more days of work (P = .005); clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 17.2% versus 42.7% and in bilateral AOM 21.7% versus 46.3%, with day 8 failures 17.2% versus 42.7% (unilateral) and 21.7% vs 46.3% (bilateral). Adverse events occurred in 52.8% versus 36.1% (P = .003), overall condition and tympanic membrane appearance favored antibiotics at end of treatment (P < .001), and two placebo recipients developed severe infection (pneumococcal bacteremia or radiographically confirmed pneumonia).

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial protocol in toddlers — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — specified dose, population, definition, compliance, and outcome. Tähtinen et al conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, intention-to-treat study of amoxicillin-clavulanate (40 mg/kg/day) versus placebo. Three hundred nineteen patients from 6 to 35 months of age were studied: 161 in the antibiotic group and 158 in the placebo group. AOM definition was the presence of MEE, distinct erythema over a bulging or yellow TM, and acute symptoms such as ear pain, fever, or respiratory symptoms. Compliance was measured by using daily patient diaries and number of capsules remaining at the end of the study. Primary outcome was time to treatment failure defined as a composite of 6 independent components.

### Otitis media [^117N8kDP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. The distribution of bacteria causing AOM in North America under the influence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure has resulted in a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, amoxicillin/clavulanate in high dosage would be the preferred treatment based on the otopathogen mix currently. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^115EmKpe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of acute and chronic suppurative otitis media in children [^117RFwUb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood illness. These middle ear infections may be frequent and painful. AOM may be associated with perforation of the tympanic membrane and can progress to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of long-term antibiotics (for longer than six weeks) in preventing any AOM, AOM with perforation and CSOM.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March Week 3 2006), OLD MEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to December 2005) and the references of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of long-term (longer than six weeks) antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment for the prevention of AOM, AOM with perforation, or CSOM were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data for: any AOM; episodes of AOM; any recurrent AOM; episodes of illness; any side effects; any antibiotic resistance, as well as outcomes at end of intervention (any AOM); and following cessation of intervention (any AOM). For dichotomous outcomes, the summary risk ratio (fixed and random-effects models) was calculated. For rate outcomes, the summary incidence rate ratio was calculated.

Main Results

Sixteen studies involving 1483 children met our inclusion criteria. All studies enrolled children at increased risk of AOM, and in seven studies the children were prone to otitis media. The majority of studies were high quality and most (15 studies) reported data for our primary outcomes. None reported AOM with perforation or CSOM. Long-term antibiotics reduced any episode of AOM (13 studies, 1358 children, risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.75; random-effects model) and number of episodes of AOM (12 studies, 1112 children, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.62; random-effects model). Approximately five children would need to be treated long term to prevent one child experiencing AOM whilst on treatment. Antibiotics prevented 1.5 episodes of AOM for every 12 months of treatment per child. Statistical heterogeneity was explored. Long-term antibiotics were not associated with a significant increase in adverse events (11 studies, 714 children, RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 15.89; random-effects model).

Authors' Conclusions

For children at risk, antibiotics given once or twice daily will reduce the probability of AOM while the child is on treatment. Antibiotics will reduce the number of episodes of AOM per year from around three to around 1.5. We believe that larger absolute benefits are likely in high-risk children. These conclusions were not affected by sensitivity analyses.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

Background

For children at high risk of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), strategies to prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) may reduce progression to CSOM.

Methods

In a double blind study in northern Australia, 103 Aboriginal infants with first detection of OME were randomised to receive either amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d BD) or placebo for 24 weeks, or until bilateral aerated middle ears were diagnosed at two successive monthly examinations (success). Standardised clinical assessments and international standards for microbiology were used.

Results

Five of 52 infants in the amoxicillin group and none of 51 infants in the placebo group achieved success at the end of therapy (Risk Difference = 9.6% [95% confidence interval 1.6,17.6]). Amoxicillin significantly reduced the proportion of children with i) perforation at the end of therapy (27% to 12% RD = -16% [-31,-1]), ii) recurrent perforation during therapy (18% to 4% RD = -14% [-25,-2]), and iii) reduced the proportion of examinations with a diagnosis of perforation during therapy (20% to 8% adjusted risk ratio 0.36 [0.15,0.83] p = 0.017). During therapy, the proportion of examinations with penicillin non-susceptible (MIC > 0.1 microg/ml) pneumococci was not significantly different between the amoxicillin group (34%) and the placebo group (40%). Beta-lactamase positive non-capsular H. influenzae (NCHi) were uncommon during therapy but more frequent in the amoxicillin group (10%) than placebo (5%).

Conclusion

Aboriginal infants receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations, and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112rLymK]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media — microbiology and effect sizes indicate benefit: tympanocentesis cultures showed 55% with bacteria only and 15% with bacteria and virus; a meta-analysis reported a 14% increase in absolute rates of clinical improvement, and systematic reviews before 2011 found increases of 6% to 12% with initial antibiotics. Trials using stringent diagnostic criteria in young children showed differences in clinical improvement of 26% to 35% favoring antibiotics, with greater benefit for bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea; antibiotic therapy also decreased duration of pain, analgesic use, or school absence and parent days missed from work. Children younger than 2 years may take longer to improve and are more likely to benefit, yet many cases resolve without antibiotics, and a clinically significant benefit is observed for bilateral AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or AOM with otorrhea.

Diagnosis and Outcome assessments

Eligibility and scheduling

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrolment to randomization, and monthly over the 24 week intervention period or until success was documented.

Assessments

At each study visit a paediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomisation visit, and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Criteria for otitis media categories (Table 1)

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria and severity scale for worse ear

Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorised as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

Success

The primary outcome ('success'), was detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

Statistical power and methods

We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate (5% to 25%). This would also give 88% power to detect a 30% reduction in perforation at the end of therapy (60% to 30%). Interim analysis and stopping rule was intended to be applied if the success rate in the active arm was 40%.

Data were analysed according to a pre-determined plan. We used the outcome in the worse ear (the ear with the highest severity score) to avoid dependence between ears. Estimates of treatment effect are given as the difference between amoxicillin and placebo groups in the prevalence of each outcome at the end of therapy, as a difference in the proportion of examinations during therapy (risk difference and unadjusted 95% confidence interval) or as a adjusted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (adjusted for repeat child examinations using generalised linear models – Poisson). For children who failed to complete therapy, the last available assessment was used. Two sided significance tests were used throughout. All calculations used Stata version 9.

### Management of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media: new options with familiar antibiotics [^117Nosa3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent and persistent acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem, affecting close to 20% of children in their first years of life. It presents a therapeutic challenge to physicians, particularly as beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, as well as penicillin- and, more recently, macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are often responsible for AOM in these patients. Intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) has been shown to be effective in treating nonresponsive AOM, but there have been relatively few clinical trials exploring oral antibiotic regimens. Higher doses of commonly used antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate ratio, 14:1 ratio and azithromycin 60 mg/kg divided into three equal once daily doses) have demonstrated high rates of clinical success. These studies will be discussed together with a review of the clinical and microbiologic characteristics of this disease. We will also address the impact that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may have on the microbiology of recurrent and persistent AOM.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^1125pBPJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies were conducted in pediatric patients with acute otitis media. A non-comparative, open-label study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of AUGMENTIN ES-600 (90/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) for 10 days in 521 pediatric patients (3 to 50 months) with acute otitis media. The primary objective was to assess bacteriological response in children with acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs of 4 mcg/mL. The study sought the enrollment of patients with the following risk factors: Failure of antibacterial therapy for acute otitis media in the previous 3 months, history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media, 2 years or younger, or daycare attendance. Prior to receiving AUGMENTIN ES-600, all patients had tympanocentesis to obtain middle ear fluid for bacteriological evaluation. Patients from whom S. pneumoniae (alone or in combination with other bacteria) was isolated had a second tympanocentesis 4 to 6 days after the start of therapy. Clinical assessments were planned for all patients during treatment (4 to 6 days after starting therapy), as well as 2 to 4 days post-treatment and 15 to 18 days post-treatment. Bacteriological success was defined as the absence of the pretreatment pathogen from the on-therapy tympanocentesis specimen. Clinical success was defined as improvement or resolution of signs and symptoms. Clinical failure was defined as lack of improvement or worsening of signs and/or symptoms at any time following at least 72 hours of AUGMENTIN ES-600; patients who received an additional systemic antibacterial drug for otitis media after 3 days of therapy were considered clinical failures. Bacteriological eradication on therapy (day 4 to 6 visit) in the per protocol population is summarized in Table 5.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Otitis media with effusion in children [^111DMZrm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of children have been affected by otitis media with effusion (OME) by the age of 4 years, but prevalence declines beyond 6 years of age. Non-purulent middle-ear infections can occur in children or adults after upper respiratory tract infection or acute otitis media. Half or more of cases resolve within 3 months and 95% within 1 year, but complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea, and cholesteatoma can occur.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent otitis media with effusion in children? What are the effects of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical interventions to treat otitis media with effusion in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found one systematic review and one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adenoidectomy, antibiotics, antihistamines, autoinflation, bottle feeding, decongestants, exposure to other children, intranasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, oral corticosteroids, passive smoking, and ventilation tubes.

### Reducing the frequency of acute otitis media by individualized care [^1172ndJU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine if use of more stringent diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media (AOM) than currently advocated by the American Academy of Pediatrics, tympanocentesis and pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment (individualized care) would result in reducing the incidence of recurrent AOM and consequent tympanostomy tube surgery.

Methods

A 5-year longitudinal, prospective study in Rochester, NY, was conducted from July 2006 to July 2011 involving 254 individualized care children. When this individualized care group developed symptoms of AOM, strict diagnostic criteria were applied and a tympanocentesis was performed. Pathogen resistance to empiric high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (80 mg/kg of amoxicillin component) caused a change in antibiotic to an optimized choice. Legacy controls (n = 208) were diagnosed with the same diagnostic criteria by the same physicians as the individualized care group and received the same empiric amoxicillin/clavulanate (80 mg/kg of amoxicillin component) but no tympanocentesis or change in antibiotic. Community control children (n = 1020) were diagnosed according to current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and treated with high-dose amoxicillin (80 mg/kg) without tympanocentesis as guideline recommended.

Results

5.9% of children of the individualized care group compared with 14.4% of Legacy controls and 27.3% of community controls became otitis prone, defined as 3 episodes of AOM within a 6-month time span or 4 AOM episodes within a 12-month time span (P < 0.0001). 2.4% of the individualized care group compared with 6.3% of Legacy controls, and 14.8% of community controls received tympanostomy tubes (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Individualized care of AOM significantly reduces the frequency of AOM and tympanostomy tube surgery. Use of strict diagnostic criteria for AOM and empiric antibiotic treatment using evidence-based knowledge of circulating otopathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile also produces improved outcomes.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^117JTqVo]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute otitis media (AOM) pain management states Key Action Statement 2: "The management of AOM should include an assessment of pain. If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain" with "Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation". Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy "does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years", whereas "analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed". The management of pain "should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics", and "Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed". Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on "the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks" and "incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference". Topical analgesics are excluded "in the presence of a perforated TM".

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1137FsEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9). Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3).

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1167djHn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1122T38W]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — watchful waiting versus immediate antibiotics (random assignment): In a trial of 233 patients randomly assigned to immediate antibiotics (amoxicillin, 90 mg/kg/day) or watchful waiting, inclusion required symptoms of ear infection, otoscopic evidence of AOM, and nonsevere AOM defined by a 3-item symptom score (OM-3) and an 8-item tympanic membrane appearance scale (OS-8). In the watchful waiting group, 66% of children completed the study without antibiotics, and there was no difference in parent satisfaction scores at day 12. Immediate antibiotics resolved symptoms faster than watchful waiting (P = .004), with a greater difference in children younger than 2 years (P = .008), and otoscopic and tympanogram scores were lower with antibiotics (P = .02 for otoscopic score, P = .004 for tympanogram). Failure and recurrence at 12 days were lower with antibiotics (5%) than with watchful waiting (21%), but by day 30 there was no difference (23% and 24%, respectively). Immediate antibiotics eradicated S pneumoniae carriage in the majority, but antibiotic-group day 12 isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant than those from watchful waiting.

### Prognostic factors for treatment failure in acute otitis media [^112nBjM4]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Antimicrobial treatment is effective in the management of acute otitis media (AOM), but approximately half of the children may recover without antimicrobial agents. By identifying patients who may not require antimicrobial treatment for the management of AOM, the use of antimicrobial agents could be substantially reduced. Our aim was to identify subgroups of children with AOM who would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment and children who could be suitable for initial observation.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children 6 to 35 months of age with AOM (N = 319) were randomly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (40/5.7 mg/kg per day) or placebo for 7 days. Our primary outcome was time until treatment failure.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 31.7% of all children. Older age (24–35 months) and peaked tympanogram at entry decreased the hazard for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.96; p = 0.04; and hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.88; p = 0.02, respectively). The rate difference for treatment failure between antimicrobial treatment and placebo groups was highest among children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (11.1% vs 64.1%; rate difference -53.0%; 95% CI, -73.5% to -32.4%), resulting in a number needed to treat of 1.9.

Conclusions

Children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane seem to benefit most from antimicrobial treatment of AOM. On the other hand, children with peaked tympanogram (A and C curves) may be optimal candidates for initial observation.

### Evidence assessment of management of acute otitis media: I. the role of antibiotics in treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media [^116AVPji]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Context

In 1995, > 5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures.

Objectives

To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens.

Data Sources

Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999 and reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines.

Study Selection

Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children 4 weeks to 18 years old were included; those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and 8 quality components for cohort studies.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%, a 12% (95% confidence interval: 0.04–0.20) reduction. Adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal, were more common among children on cefixime than among those on ampicillin or amoxicillin. They were also more common among children on amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those on azithromycin.

Conclusions

The majority of uncomplicated cases of AOM resolve spontaneously without apparent suppurative complications. Ampicillin or amoxicillin confers a limited therapeutic benefit. There is no evidence to support any particular antibiotic regimens as more effective at relieving symptoms. Certain antibiotics are more likely than others to cause diarrhea and other adverse events.

The antibiotic preferences of 2,190 pediatricians (peds) 360 general practitioners (GPs), and 273 otolaryngologists (ENTs) in the United States and concurrence with treatment guideline recommendations for acute otitis media (AOM) for suspected drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae before and after an educational workshop were compared. Peds and GPs preferred amoxicillin/clavulanate high-dose, whereas ENTs preferred higher generation cephalosporins. Before the workshop, endorsement of guideline-recommended antibiotics for treatment of AOM caused by DRSP by Peds, GPs, and ENTs was 80%, 75%, and 78%, respectively, and for Haemophilus influenzae was 73%, 63%, and 84%, respectively. After the workshop concurrence with AOM guideline recommendations for DRSP increased to 96%, 95%, and 97% and for H. influenzae increased to 93%, 94%, and 96% for Peds, GPs, and ENTs, respectively (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Peds, GPs, and ENTs select appropriate antibiotics for AOM 63–84% of the time. After instruction that provides the rationale for guideline-recommended agents based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and double tympanocentesis trials, endorsement of recommended antibiotics significantly improved to > 90%.

Discussion

We have studied OM in Aboriginal communities where almost all children have persistent middle ear disease from an early age; nevertheless, our results could also be relevant for other high-risk groups. The primary outcome from our double-blind RCT is that amoxicillin significantly increased the proportion of children achieving normal middle ears (bilaterally aerated) at consecutive monthly examinations. Amoxicillin also reduced the proportion of children with any perforation. The proportion with any suppurative OM was also less in the amoxicillin group at the end of therapy, but not significantly so (Table 2). The proportion of children on amoxicillin experiencing at least two episodes of AOMwiP during therapy was less than for placebo children (4% versus 18%, respectively). There was no difference between placebo and amoxicillin in the proportion of children with OME (~52% in each group) or AOMwoP (~22%) at the end of therapy. Risk differences during therapy (supplementary material) were consistent with the end of therapy findings. Pneumococcal non-susceptibility was similar in amoxicillin and placebo groups, however a greater proportion of children in the amoxicillin group were colonised by beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae at both baseline and at end of therapy.

Our findings can be understood in terms of the natural history of OM in high-risk populations. In Aboriginal children, AOM is usually asymptomatic with parents unaware that their child is unwell. In community-based screening, some 20% to 30% of Aboriginal children have bulging eardrums. Only a minority have the typical symptoms (sudden onset of middle ear effusion with pain or fever) which define AOM in low-risk populations. To explain our findings in this high-risk population, we suggest that in placebo recipients, asymptomatic middle ear infection often progresses to AOM with perforation, whereas continuous amoxicillin helps to prevent that progression. This is consistent with our previous study of short-term antibiotics for asymptomatic AOM which indicated that the majority of children still satisfy the criteria for AOM despite treatment for 7 to 14 days. The present study suggests that therapy can be more successful if it is maintained long-term. We believe that this can be explained by the association of bacterial load with increased severity of OM. It may be that continuous antibiotics maintain bacterial load below a critical threshold for more severe disease.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotic therapy or offering observation with close follow-up in patients aged 6–23 months without severe signs or symptoms. Initiate antibiotic therapy if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Key action statement 4A — For acute otitis media (AOM), clinicians should prescribe amoxicillin for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made and the child has not received amoxicillin in the past 30 days or the child does not have concurrent purulent conjunctivitis or the child is not allergic to penicillin (Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Recommendation); benefits include that amoxicillin is effective for most children with AOM and is inexpensive, safe, has acceptable taste, and a narrow antimicrobial spectrum, while risks include ineffectiveness against β-lactamase–producing organisms and adverse effects of amoxicillin, with a preponderance of benefit noted; exclusions include patients with known penicillin allergy, and clinicians must determine whether the patient is truly penicillin allergic, with patient preferences considered if there was previous bad experience with amoxicillin.

Ear Assessments during therapy [see Additional Files 3 and 4]

Bilaterally normal ears were seen at least once in 11 (21%) amoxicillin infants and 5 (10%) placebo infants. More children in the amoxicillin group had at least one diagnosis of OME and more had AOMwoP. Fewer amoxicillin children had AOMwiP detected (25% and 33%, respectively), and recurrent AOMwiP was identified in significantly fewer amoxicillin children (4%) and than placebo children (18%) (RD = -14% [-25, -2]).

Results were similar when expressed as a proportion of examinations for each group. Bilateral normal ears were detected in 6% and 2% of visits in amoxicillin and placebo infants, respectively (adjusted risk ratio = 2.7 [0.78, 9.13] p = 0.116). OME was the worst ear diagnosis at about half the visits in each group, AOMwoP was detected in about one quarter of visits. AOMwiP was less often diagnosed in children receiving amoxicillin (8%) than placebo (19%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.36 [0.16, 0.84] p = 0.017). For combined diagnostic categories of any suppurative OM, any perforation, and any active perforation, significant differences in perforation were found. Antibiotic prescribing for a clinical indication was less often required at examinations of amoxicillin children (55%) then placebo children (68%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.67 [0.36, 1.22] p = 0.190). Tables S2a and S2b give more detail of ear status over the course of the trial [see Additional files 3 and 4].

Nasopharyngeal outcomes at the end of therapy (Table 2)

At the end of therapy, carriage of OM pathogens, and carriage of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (34% in amoxicillin group and 40% in placebo group) was not significantly different between groups.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

≸AOMwoP, AOMwiP or CSOM;

≹AOMwiP, dry perforation or CSOM

In the period from birth to randomisation, diagnoses of OM or respiratory illnesses other than OM, and antibiotic use (oral or IM) had been documented by clinic staff for more than half the children in each group (data not shown). All children were less than 12 months of age at enrolment. There were 321 examinations by study staff between enrolment and randomisation; bilateral normal ears were diagnosed in 12% of examinations, OME in about 50%, AOM in 26%, and perforations in less than 10%.

52 infants were allocated to amoxicillin and 51 to placebo, and the groups were similar for mean age of mothers, mean infant gestational age, proportion male, number of study visits before randomisation, age at randomisation, and distribution of ear-states prior to randomisation. Mean birth weight was significantly greater for placebo infants (p = 0.0013).

Ear states at randomisation

At randomisation 50 (96%) of amoxicillin infants and 49 (96%) of placebo infants had OME as the worst ear diagnosis; 3 infants had resolving AOM and started the intervention study after an additional week of antibiotic treatment; one infant (placebo) had unilateral dry perforation.

Nasopharyngeal carriage at randomisation [see Additional File 2]

On the day of randomisation, carriage of each respiratory bacterial pathogen was high in both groups (between 73% and 81%). All three OM bacterial pathogens were carried by half of the children in each group (54% and 53% respectively); penicillin non-susceptible (MIC > 0.1 μg.ml) pneumococci were carried by 27% and 37% in amoxicillin and placebo groups, respectively. Beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae were detected in 6% and 2% of children respectively. None of these differences reached statistical significance.

### Exploring the burden of paediatric acute otitis media with discharge in the UK: a qualitative study [^115wxTiS]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute otitis media with discharge (AOMd) results from a tympanic membrane perforation secondary to acute otitis media (AOM), which is one of the most common paediatric infections. Approximately 15% of children and young people (CYP) with AOM develop ear discharge.CYP with AOMd have been shown to have more severe systemic illness and more disease-related complications, compared with CYP with AOM. Patient and parental experience has been investigated within the context of AOM but not AOMd. Approximately 41 000 primary care appointments are required each year to manage AOMd in the UK. It is essential to explore the impact of AOMd on CYP and their parents to understand the burden of this disease.

The medical management of AOMd in primary and secondary care is heterogeneous, with a mix of oral, topical or no antibiotics being prescribed. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that CYP with AOMd be treated with oral amoxicillin. This recommendation is based on evidence from a subgroup analysis of 116 CYP with AOMd treated with oral antibiotics against placebo, from a meta-analysis of 6 studies. Topical antibiotics treat the source of the AOMd infection, but there is concern over the potential ototoxic effects which have been addressed by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) UK consensus report. Understanding the principles governing management strategies from the perspective of different healthcare professionals is vital.

To help standardise medical management for AOMd, high-quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required. Caldwell et al assessed parental attitudes to the participation of children in RCTs, highlighting risk–benefit decision making. To ensure the design of a future RCT is relevant and impactful, we must engage with the key stakeholders (CYP, parents and medical professionals) to hear their thoughts.

The primary aim was to explore the impact of AOMd on CYP and their parents' daily lives and to understand medical professionals' experiences and treatment strategies. The secondary aim was to assess parental and medical professional opinions on how to best design an RCT comparing antibiotic treatments for AOMd.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^113zjyLA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the USA, Canada and Australia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2012), Current Contents (1966 to November 2012), CINAHL (2008 to November 2012) and LILACS (2008 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 12 RCTs (3317 children and 3854 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible. However, one trial did not report patient-relevant outcomes, leaving 11 trials with generally low risk of bias. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20) and fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95; NNTB 20). When compared with placebo, antibiotics did not alter the number of abnormal tympanometry findings at either four to six weeks (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) or at three months (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24), or the number of AOM recurrences (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10). However, antibiotic treatment did lead to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral AOM episodes (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) as compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) were eligible. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis on pain at days three to seven. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic group or the expectant observation group. Additionally, no difference in tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence was observed. Immediate antibiotic prescribing was associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash as compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of children with AOM experiencing pain at two to seven days compared with placebo but since most children (82%) settle spontaneously, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one suffering from ear pain at two to seven days. Additionally, antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (NNTB 33) and contralateral AOM episodes (NNTB 11). These benefits must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics had been withheld. Antibiotics appear to be most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease, an expectant observational approach seems justified. We have no trials in populations with higher risks of complications.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute otorrhea through tympanostomy tube: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with daily follow-up [^116sjhqj]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of routine antimicrobial treatment of acute middle-ear infections is under debate, because the efficacy of antimicrobials in the resolution of middle-ear fluid has not been unambiguously proven. Acute tube otorrhea is regarded as evidence of acute otitis media, and for methodologic reasons it was chosen to provide objectivity for diagnostics and outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to assess whether amoxicillin-clavulanate accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in outpatient setting.

Patients

Volunteer sample of basically healthy 6- to 72-month-old children with a tympanostomy tube. Eligibility required having acute tube otorrhea of < 48 hours' of duration and no prior treatment within the last 2 weeks. The mean age of the participants was 25 months; they had a history of 3 episodes of acute otitis media (median), and 99% had manifestations of a concomitant respiratory infection. Of 79 randomized patients, 7 were withdrawn because of adverse events; 66 patients completed the study.

Interventions

Amoxicillin-clavulanate (N = 34; 45 mg/kg/d) or matching placebo (N = 32) for 7 days and daily suction of middle-ear fluid through tympanostomy tube.

Main Outcome Measures

Duration of acute tube otorrhea and duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

Results

The median duration of tube otorrhea was significantly shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (3 vs 8 days). At the end of the 7-day medication period, tube otorrhea was resolved in 28 of 34 children receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 13 of 32 children on placebo (treatment-control difference 41%; 95% confidence interval, 20%-63%; number needed to treat, 2.4). The median duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid was shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (1 vs 8 days).

Conclusions

Oral antibiotic treatment significantly accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea by reducing bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

Non-responders at 2 to 4 days post-therapy were considered failures at the latter timepoint. The clinical assessments in the per protocol population are presented in Table 6.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, overall clinical outcomes at 2 to 4 days and 15 to 18 days post-treatment in patients with S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC equal to 2 mcg/mL and 4 mcg/mL were 29/41 (71%) and 17/41 (42%), respectively.

### Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in children with acute otitis media and ear discharge: a systematic review [^1143rHg1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections and a leading cause of doctor consultations and antibiotic prescribing worldwide. Around 15%–20% of children with AOM present with acute onset ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (AOMd). In contrast to widespread beliefs, children with AOMd have similar levels of ear pain and feel less well at presentation than those without ear discharge (AOMwd). Also, children with AOMd have a higher disease burden with higher rates of ear pain and/or fever at 3–7 days and more AOM recurrences and hearing problems at 3 months compared with children without ear discharge. Antibiotics are more effective in children with AOMd than in those with AOMwd; number needed to treat to achieve resolution of ear pain and/or fever at days 3 to 7: 3 versus 8, respectively. AOM guidelines therefore recommend clinicians to consider immediate antibiotic prescribing in children with AOMd, in contrast to AOMwd, for which a watchful waiting approach is recommended for otherwise healthy children with nonsevere unilateral disease.

It has been suggested that the differences in clinical picture and disease course between AOMwd and AOMd might be attributed to differences in causative pathogens. A 2016 systematic review including 38 published reports of microbiology of children with AOMwd found that Streptococcus pneumoniae (average detection rate of 27.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (23.1%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.0%) are the most common bacteria associated with AOMwd globally. Streptococcus pyogenes is thought to be more prevalent in children with AOMd, – but data are conflicting. – The routine administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) during infancy has led to a change in childhood AOM epidemiology. – This review aims to provide an overview of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacteria in children with AOMd in the post-PCV era.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115PKrFc]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^1142CsAh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in children with acute otitis media remains controversial.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, children 6 to 35 months of age with acute otitis media, diagnosed with the use of strict criteria, received amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 children) or placebo (158 children) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure from the first dose until the end-of-treatment visit on day 8. The definition of treatment failure was based on the overall condition of the child (including adverse events) and otoscopic signs of acute otitis media.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 44.9% of the children who received placebo (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was already apparent at the first scheduled visit (day 3), at which time 13.7% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 25.3% of those who received placebo, had treatment failure. Overall, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced the progression to treatment failure by 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.59; P < 0.001) and the need for rescue treatment by 81% (6.8% vs. 33.5%; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Analgesic or antipyretic agents were given to 84.2% and 85.9% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were significantly more common in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the placebo group. A total of 47.8% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group had diarrhea, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001); 8.7% and 3.2% of the children in the respective groups had eczema (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Children with acute otitis media benefit from antimicrobial treatment as compared with placebo, although they have more side effects. Future studies should identify patients who may derive the greatest benefit, in order to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and the development of bacterial resistance.

This was an investigator-blinded, randomized, comparative, multicenter trial, in which tympanocentesis was performed in 384 patients, ages 6 months to 12 years, who had nonrefractory AOM. Patients were randomized to receive one of three 10-day treatment regimens: cefdinir 14 mg/kg daily (QD; n = 128); cefdinir 7 mg/kg twice a day (BID; n = 128); or amoxicillin/clavulanate 40/10 mg/kg/day divided for use three times a day (TID; n = 128).

Results

Of the 384 enrolled patients 303 were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Clinical success rates were statistically equivalent for the 3 treatment groups at the end of therapy: 85 of 102 (83.3%) for cefdinir QD; 81 of 101 (80.2%) for cefdinir BID; 86 of 100 (86%) for amoxicillin/clavulanate. Of the 197 evaluable patients from whom a susceptible pathogen was recovered, presumptive eradication rates at end of therapy were equivalent: 55 of 65 (84.6%), 54 of 66 (81.8%) and 55 of 66 (83.3%) for cefdinir QD-, cefdinir BID- and amoxicillin/clavulanate-treated patients, respectively. However, presumptive eradication rates for Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly lower for cefdinir BID (55.2%) than for amoxicillin/clavulanate (89.5%; P = 0.0019) and marginally lower than for cefdinir QD (80%; P = 0.054). Diarrhea was the most common treatment-associated adverse reaction in all groups but was significantly more common in amoxicillin/clavulanate-treated patients (35%) than in patients who had been treated with cefdinir QD (10%, P < 0.001) or cefdinir BID (13%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

A 10-day regimen of cefdinir 14 mg/kg QD or 7 mg/kg BID was as clinically effective overall as a 10-day regimen of amoxicillin/ clavulanate 40/10 mg/kg/day divided TID in the treatment of tympanocentesis-confirmed, nonrefractory AOM in children. These data suggest that cefdinir QD may be a better alternative than cefdinir BID for refractory AOM. Both dosing regimens of cefdinir were associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse reactions than was amoxicillin/clavulanate.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^114yhws4]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Randomized, investigator-blinded, multicenter, comparative study of gatifloxacin versus amoxicillin / clavulanate in recurrent otitis media and acute otitis media treatment failure in children [^113YQHh9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent otitis media and acute otitis media treatment failure are commonly encountered in the pediatric population.

Objective

To compare the clinical efficacy of gatifloxacin with amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media treatment failure and recurrent otitis media.

Methods

Three hundred fifty-four children 6 months-7 years with recurrent otitis media and/or acute otitis media failure were stratified according to age (younger than 2 years versus 2 years or older) and then randomly assigned to 10 days of treatment with gatifloxacin 10 mg/kg once daily or amoxicillin/clavulanate 90 mg/6.4 mg in 2 divided doses. Tympanocentesis was performed in 116 children with acute otitis media treatment failure and 52 with recurrent otitis media at study entry to validate the clinical diagnosis and provide microbiologic data. The primary outcome measure was clinical resolution of infection at the test-of-cure visit 3–10 days after completing treatment.

Results

Clinical resolution of acute otitis media was observed in 79.0% (49 of 62) of clinically evaluable children younger than 2 years and 90.3% (56 of 62) of those 2 years or older who were treated with gatifloxacin as compared with 77.6% (45 of 58) of children younger than 2 years and 79.7% (47 of 59) of children 2 years or older treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. In patients with acute otitis media treatment failure, clinical response rates for children younger than 2 years and those 2 years or older were 87.5% (21 of 24) and 97.0% (32 of 33) with gatifloxacin versus 63.6% (14 of 22) and 83.9% (26 of 31) with amoxicillin/clavulanate. The corresponding clinical response rates in patients with recurrent otitis media were 79.2% (19 of 24) and 85.7% (18 of 21) with gatifloxacin and 90.5% (19 of 21) and 76.0% (19 of 25) with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Clinical success in those subjects having pretreatment middle ear fluid pathogens was similar for the 2 regimens [80.0% (24 of 30) gatifloxacin, 77.1% (27 of 35) amoxicillin/clavulanate]. Emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains was not observed. Both drugs were generally well-tolerated. Diarrhea was the most common drug-related adverse event (10% gatifloxacin, 18% amoxicillin/clavulanate). No evidence of abnormal joint or gait findings was found during a 12-month follow-up.

Conclusions

Gatifloxacin once daily is at least as effective and well-tolerated as amoxicillin/clavulanate twice daily in children with acute otitis media treatment failure or recurrent otitis media. There was no evidence of arthrotoxicity or emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in gatifloxacin-treated children.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media in the urgent care setting [^113a45ZX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of otitis media is increasing, which affects health care resource utilization across all segments, including the urgent care setting. One of the greatest challenges in the management of acute otitis media (AOM) is the effective treatment of cases caused by pathogens that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Whereas the production of beta-lactamases among strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is an important consideration for antimicrobial therapy, the high prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other classes of antibiotics among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae represents a greater clinical concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently convened the Drug Resistant S. pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of AOM in an era of prevalent resistance. The recommendations from this group included amoxicillin as the preferred first-line drug because of the demonstrated activity against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, using higher dosages of up to 90 mg/kg per day in certain settings. For patients in whom initial treatment is unsuccessful after 3 days, the recommended agents included high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (for activity against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens), clindamycin, cefuroxime axetil, or 1 to 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone. The principles set forth in these guidelines can assist the therapeutic decisionmaking process for practitioners in the urgent care setting.

Key action statement 4B — When additional β-lactamase coverage is needed in acute otitis media (AOM), clinicians should prescribe an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made and the child has received amoxicillin in the past 30 days or has concurrent purulent conjunctivitis or has a history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin (Evidence Quality: Grade C, Rec. Strength: Recommendation); benefits include successful treatment of β-lactamase–producing organisms, with risks of cost and increased adverse effects, a preponderance of benefit, the value judgment that efficacy is more important than taste, exclusions of patients with known penicillin allergy, and consideration of patient concerns regarding side effects and taste.

### Knowledge and practices relating to the 2004 acute otitis media clinical practice guideline: a survey of practicing physicians [^115FsrYS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify primary care physicians' familiarity with the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) clinical practice guideline and to compare their practices with its recommendations.

Design

Mail survey October through December 2004 to all active physician members of the Slone Center Office-based Research Network, a national, practice-based, pediatric research network.

Results

The response rate was 276 of 469 (58.8%). Overall, 90.5% had read the guideline or summaries of it. Pneumatic otoscopy was always used by 16.2%, used half the time or more by 23.1%, used less than half the time by 34.6% and never used by 26.2%. Observation is considered a reasonable option for some AOM cases by 88.0% and, over the previous 3 months, these physicians used observation a median of 10% of the time (25th and 75th percentiles, 5% and 25%, respectively). In terms of concern that the observation option may increase AOM complications, 75.6% were not at all or only slightly concerned; 24.4% were moderately or very concerned. In general, these physicians have altered their antibiotic prescribing practices for AOM towards the guideline's recommendations since its publication. However, antibiotic choices deviated most widely from the guideline in cases of AOM with severe illness, where only 17.9% follow the recommendation for high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, and in cases of children who fail treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, where only 27.7% favor the recommended intramuscular ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

Most physicians in this survey are familiar with the AOM guideline, but many do not follow its diagnostic and antibiotic recommendations. Observation for selected cases is acceptable to most of these physicians and is currently used in a small proportion of cases.

### Large dosage amoxicillin / clavulanate, compared with azithromycin, for the treatment of bacterial acute otitis media in children [^116avFi8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A large dosage pediatric formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate with an improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile was developed to eradicate many penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains).

Methods

This randomized, investigator-blinded, multicenter trial examined treatment of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) in children 6–30 months of age with amoxicillin/clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 10 days) versus azithromycin (10 mg/kg for 1 day followed by 5 mg/kg/d for 4 days). Tympanocentesis was performed at entry for bacteriologic assessment, at the on-therapy visit (day 4–6) to determine bacterial eradication and at any time before the end-of-therapy visit (day 12–14) if the child was categorized as experiencing clinical failure. Clinical assessments were performed at the on-therapy, end-of-therapy and follow-up (day 21–25) visits.

Results

We enrolled 730 children; AOM pathogens were isolated at baseline for 249 of the amoxicillin/clavulanate group and 245 of the azithromycin group. For children with AOM pathogens at baseline, clinical success rates at the end-of-therapy visit were 90.5% for amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 80.9% for azithromycin (P < 0.01), and those at the on-therapy and follow-up visits were 94.9% versus 88.0% and 80.3% versus 71.1%, respectively (all P < 0.05). At the on-therapy visit, pretherapy pathogens were eradicated for 94.2% of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 70.3% of those receiving azithromycin (P < 0.001). Amoxicillin/clavulanate eradicated 96.0% of S. pneumoniae (92.0% of fully penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae) and 89.7% of H. influenzae (85.7% [6 of 7 cases] of beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae). Corresponding rates for azithromycin were 80.4% (54.5%) for S. pneumoniae and 49.1% (100% [1 of 1 case]) for H. influenzae (all P < 0.01 for between-drug comparisons).

Conclusion

Amoxicillin/clavulanate was clinically and bacteriologically more effective than azithromycin among children with bacterial AOM, including cases caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^115ZcJR7]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss.

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Cefprozil versus high-dose amoxicillin / clavulanate in children with acute otitis media [^116gYckn]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The recommendation of the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group that high-dose amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, be used to treat acute otitis media (AOM) addressed concerns about the efficacy of existing therapies against drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. This recommendation relied on pharmacodynamic predictions of concentrations of amoxicillin in middle-ear fluid remaining higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations against intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae for > 40% of the dosing interval.

Objective

This study compared the tolerability and efficacy of cefprozil and high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate in patients with AOM.

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive 10 days of investigator-blinded oral treatment with either cefprozil suspension (30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses) or amoxicillin/clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/d) plus amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) in 2 divided doses. The primary efficacy end point was the clinical cure rate 4 to 7 days after the end of treatment. Clinical response by age (6 months- < 2 years vs ≥ 2–7 years), disease severity, and unilateral versus bilateral ear infection was also examined. The primary measures of tolerability were the frequency and severity of adverse events and their relation to study drug. Adverse events were either spontaneously reported or elicited during examination and questioning of the patient. Identified adverse events were coded and recorded using the COSTART (Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms) system.

Results

Three hundred four children between the ages of 6 months and 7 years with ≥ 1 sign or symptom of AOM were enrolled in the study, and 303 (150 cefprozil, 153 amoxicillin/clavulanate) were treated. Twenty-three patients in each treatment group were not evaluable; thus, 257 children were included in the analysis of evaluable patients. Clinical cure rates were 87% (110/127) with cefprozil and 89% (116/130) with amoxicillin/clavulanate (95% CI for the difference in cure rate, -10.7% to 4.1%). No between-group differences in efficacy were noted by age, disease severity, or unilateral or bilateral involvement. The overall incidence of drug-related adverse events was significantly lower with cefprozil than with amoxicillin/clavulanate (19% vs 32%, respectively; P = 0.008), as was the incidence of diarrhea (9% vs 19%, respectively; P = 0.021). Adverse events prompted discontinuation of therapy in 4 (3%) cefprozil patients and 8 (5%) amoxicillin/clavulanate patients.

Conclusions

Based on a search of MEDLINE, this study is the first direct comparison of cefprozil versus high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate. Cefprozil was as effective as high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, with a lower incidence of adverse events.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment for otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation. Evidence-Based Answer. Acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation in children should be treated with an oral antibiotic. Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is better than oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for treating acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes. ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH PERFORATION A meta-analysis of six RCTs of children six months to 12 years of age with acute otitis media examined the effectiveness of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid versus placebo or delayed treatment in reducing pain, fever, or both at three to seven days.

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH TYMPANOSTOMY TUBES An industry-sponsored, single-blind RCT of 80 children six months to 12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute otitis media compared ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid oral suspension. The children treated with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone had a median time to cessation of otorrhea of four days compared with seven days for those treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical cure, defined as cessation of otorrhea at 18 days, was 84. 6 percent in the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone group versus
58. 5 percent in the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid group.
3. Recommendations from Others A 2004 joint practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians includes otorrhea as a verification of middle ear effusion in its diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media.

The recommendation to treat most children who require antibiotics with amoxicillin does not differentiate between patients with and those without tympanic membrane perforation.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^111oa2Bf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is a combination of amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and clavulanate potassium, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors (1): Antibacterial exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance.

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta lactamase producing organisms listed above. (1)

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1)

### Otitis media: rapid evidence review [^115a7wto]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^1121cmkY]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

What are the microbiological implications of long-term amoxicillin? Our study shows a significant reduction in pneumococcal carriage during amoxicillin therapy. Despite the positive results from our RCT it is unclear whether withholding antibiotics in an asymptomatic child at risk of perforation will result in a clinical deterioration that outweighs the theoretical risk of increasing antibiotic resistance should the child be treated. It is reassuring that in our RCT there was no increase in the carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci as a result of treatment, nor any difference in antibiotics prescribed for intercurrent illnesses between amoxicillin and placebo children. Indeed there was a tendency for fewer children in the amoxicillin group to be colonised by penicillin-resistant pneumococci. On the other hand, although beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae were uncommon in both groups, they were detected more frequently in children receiving amoxicillin; however, as this non-significant trend was also present before the start of trial therapy, it could be a chance finding.

Empirical studies of resistance are not available from other randomised controlled trials of long term antibiotics for otitis media. The study of perforation in Alaska natives, which also found that long-term antibiotics were beneficial, did not report on antibiotic resistance. We note that by 1997, 25% of Australian clinical isolates were penicillin non-susceptible, and high levels of penicillin resistance were reported from Aboriginal communities from the mid 1980s.

We have previously shown that OM is more advanced when multiple pathogens colonise the nasopharynx simultaneously and at high density We suggest that the effect of long-term amoxicillin is to reduce the density and multiplicity of bacterial carriage by reducing the rate of acquisition of new strains and/or the rate of proliferation of those already acquired. In the Finnish OM study 28% of new pneumococcal acquisitions were associated with pneumococcal AOM, compared with only 11% for established carriage.
