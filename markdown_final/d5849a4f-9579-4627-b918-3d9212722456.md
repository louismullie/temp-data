## Question

What is the diagnostic test for hemochromotosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic test for hereditary hemochromatosis and how to sequence testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology because "diagnostic test" could mean the first-line screening test versus the confirmatory test. Then, I should verify the initial biochemical screening strategy and thresholds. Next, I will examine the confirmatory genetic testing and when to order it. After that, I need to consider non-HFE hemochromatosis and how to approach negative HFE results. Finally, I should review advanced imaging for hepatic iron quantification and fibrosis staging, and close with practical implications and family screening recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate screening with confirmation. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the initial test is a biochemical iron panel, and the confirmatory test is HFE genotyping for C282Y and H63D, because diagnosis requires both evidence of iron overload and the correct genotype rather than genotype alone [^114Mor4a] [^113JRzAH] [^112ughp1].

> Wait, let me verify the initial biochemical screening sequence. The first-line evaluation should include transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, with thresholds of transferrin saturation ≥ 45% in women or ≥ 50% in men and ferritin > 200 mcg/L in women or > 300 mcg/L in men considered suggestive of iron overload and warranting genetic testing, while recognizing ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and secondary causes should be excluded if C282Y homozygosity is absent [^114Mor4a] [^112tWHun] [^112ubnkW] [^113GfgzE].

> Hold on, I should verify when to order the confirmatory genetic test. HFE genotyping for C282Y and H63D is indicated when transferrin saturation is elevated and/or ferritin is elevated, and also in first-degree relatives of confirmed cases, with simultaneous iron studies and HFE testing in relatives to improve efficiency, while avoiding HFE testing in isolation without biochemical evidence of iron overload unless the pretest probability is high due to family history [^113GfgzE] [^115Hz14c] [^116xnbz1] [^112VZh6F].

> I need to ensure I state the confirmatory standard correctly. HFE C282Y homozygosity in the setting of documented iron overload establishes the diagnosis of HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, but I should emphasize that C282Y homozygosity alone is not sufficient to diagnose hemochromatosis in the absence of iron overload, given variable penetrance and the need for phenotypic confirmation [^112ughp1] [^113JRzAH].

> But wait, what if HFE testing is negative despite convincing iron overload? In that scenario, I should consider rare non-HFE forms and expand testing to TFR2, HJV, HAMP, and SLC40A1, particularly in younger patients with severe phenotypes or when hepatic iron quantification by MRI or biopsy demonstrates substantial iron loading after secondary causes are excluded, though routine testing for non-HFE genes is generally not recommended in most settings due to low yield and availability [^112SQPtX] [^112Y6HRo] [^114KaSko] [^114Pjckj].

> Next, I should review how to quantify hepatic iron and stage fibrosis noninvasively. MRI is the preferred modality to quantify hepatic iron concentration and assess extrahepatic iron distribution, while transient elastography can help exclude advanced fibrosis if liver stiffness is ≤ 6.4 kPa, reserving liver biopsy for cases with ferritin > 1,000 mcg/L or elevated transaminases when noninvasive assessment is indeterminate or alternative liver diseases are suspected [^111YgvZs] [^115KBqx1] [^1111pJZK].

> I should double-check fibrosis risk stratification. A ferritin < 1,000 mcg/L with normal transaminases and no hepatomegaly predicts very low risk of advanced fibrosis, which supports deferring biopsy in lower-risk presentations and relying on noninvasive staging algorithms and MRI for iron quantification [^113CCKLs].

> Let me consider the practical implication so I don't leave the question hanging. The "diagnostic test" for hereditary hemochromatosis is a two-step process: screen with transferrin saturation and ferritin, then confirm with HFE genotyping if abnormal, while MRI has largely replaced liver biopsy for hepatic iron quantification and fibrosis assessment in modern algorithms, and all confirmed patients should prompt cascade screening of first-degree relatives with combined iron studies and HFE testing [^113GfgzE] [^117GZvjU] [^115Hz14c].

---

The diagnostic test for hemochromatosis is **HFE genetic testing** (C282Y and H63D) [^113JRzAH] in patients with elevated transferrin saturation and ferritin, confirming hereditary hemochromatosis when C282Y homozygosity is present [^113GfgzE]. Biochemical screening with **transferrin saturation and ferritin** [^114Mor4a] is the first step, and MRI is used to quantify hepatic iron and assess fibrosis noninvasively [^114gWxQZ]. Liver biopsy is reserved for cases with ferritin > 1,000 ng/mL or elevated liver enzymes to stage fibrosis or exclude other liver diseases [^115KBqx1]. Genetic testing is also recommended for first-degree relatives of confirmed cases [^112JzsjK] [^112VZh6F].

---

## Initial biochemical screening

The first step in diagnosing hemochromatosis is **biochemical screening** to detect iron overload:

- **Transferrin saturation (TS)**: TS > 45% is highly sensitive for hereditary hemochromatosis and should prompt further evaluation [^1122ADcL] [^113GfgzE].

- **Serum ferritin**: Elevated ferritin (> 300 ng/mL in men, > 200 ng/mL in women) suggests iron overload but is not specific, as ferritin is an acute-phase reactant [^112tWHun].

- **Serum iron and transferrin/TIBC**: Additional iron parameters may be measured to aid differential diagnosis [^1118Xv1A].

---

## Confirmatory genetic testing

If biochemical screening indicates iron overload, **confirmatory genetic testing** is recommended [^112ubnkW]. HFE gene testing for C282Y and H63D mutations is the standard test; C282Y homozygosity confirms hereditary hemochromatosis [^11543X31]. Non-HFE hemochromatosis is considered when there is a strong clinical suspicion of iron overload but HFE testing is negative; testing for rare variants (TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV) may be considered in specialized settings [^112SQPtX] [^112Y6HRo].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are essential for assessing **hepatic iron concentration** and organ involvement:

- **MRI**: MRI is the preferred noninvasive method to quantify hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and assess extrahepatic organ involvement (heart, pancreas) [^114gWxQZ] [^115jVXBM].

- **Cardiac MRI**: Recommended in severe cases with cardiac symptoms to quantify myocardial iron and assess cardiac function [^1156aN1v].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is generally avoided due to noninvasive alternatives but may be indicated in selected scenarios — for example, to assess **fibrosis** when ferritin is > 1,000 ng/mL or liver enzymes are elevated, to distinguish hemochromatosis from other liver diseases when the diagnosis is unclear, or when MRI is unavailable or inconclusive [^115KBqx1] [^114WENZT] [^1111pJZK].

---

## Family screening

Once a proband is diagnosed, **first-degree relatives should be screened** with HFE testing and iron studies to detect early disease and prevent complications [^112JzsjK] [^112VZh6F].

---

## Summary of diagnostic algorithm

1. **Transferrin saturation and ferritin**: Initial biochemical screening for iron overload
2. **HFE genetic testing (C282Y, H63D)**: Confirmatory diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis
3. **MRI**: Quantify hepatic iron and assess organ involvement
4. **Liver biopsy (selective)**: Assess fibrosis and exclude other liver diseases
5. **Family screening**: Identify affected relatives and prevent complications

---

The diagnostic test for hemochromatosis is **HFE genetic testing**, with biochemical screening and MRI as adjuncts; liver biopsy is reserved for select cases [^113GfgzE].

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### Screening primary care patients for hereditary hemochromatosis with transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level: systematic review for the American College of Physicians [^117BGjYx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic phlebotomy for hereditary hemochromatosis is relatively safe and presumably efficacious when offered before cirrhosis develops, so screening primary care patients is of substantial interest.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence on 1) the prevalence of the disease in primary care, 2) the risk for morbid or fatal complications for untreated patients, 3) the diagnostic usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level in identifying early disease, 4) the efficacy of early treatment, and 5) whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search from 1966 through April 2004, complemented by reference review of identified original studies and review articles published in English.

Study Selection

PubMed Clinical Queries filters search of prognosis, diagnosis, etiology, or treatment were used depending on the question. Two authors reviewed all titles and abstracts.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed extracted data.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis was 1 in 169 patients to 1 in 556 patients (n = 3 studies). Uncontrolled, prospective studies of genetic homozygous patients did not consistently identify a link to overt hereditary hemochromatosis. A serum ferritin level less than 1000 microg/L was predictive of absence of cirrhosis. Six studies demonstrated reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis. Diagnostic studies varied with respect to case definition. No blinded, independent comparisons of screening tests with the gold standard (biopsy or results of quantitative phlebotomy) or randomized, controlled trials of phlebotomy were identified. Cost-effectiveness analysis was limited by lack of prospective data on the natural history of the disease.

Limitations

Varied case definition and lack of prospective cohort studies or randomized trials.

Conclusions

The available evidence does not demonstrate that benefits outweigh the risks and costs of screening for hemochromatosis.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116Nk3eo]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, there is enough evidence to support the notion that iron indices may progress in some p.C282Y homozygotes or p.C282Y/p.H63D heterozygotes, supporting the recommendation for a biochemical follow-up. There is no evidence, however, to support a specific follow-up time or schedule. There is insufficient evidence to recommend phlebotomy treatment in unaffected (ie, without evidence of hemochromatosis) homozygotes or p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, but there is still a need for high-quality observational data on the treatment of HH.

The best practice meeting

In order to develop the initial guidelines draft into a consensus document, a workshop in the format of an EMQN Best Practice Meeting (BPM) was held in Porto, Portugal on 14 and 15 May 2014. The BPM was advertised using the same procedure as for the survey (see above) and this draft document, together with the topics for discussion, were made available before the BPM to the respondents who agreed to participate. The list of meeting attendees and respective affiliations is given in Supplementary Table 1.

As a result of the meeting, an agreed set of best practice guidelines was updated for genetic diagnostic and predictive testing for HFE-related HH and for reporting the results of such testing. In addition, some basic guidelines were also developed for testing and reporting the rarer forms of non-HFE-related HH. Resulting recommendations are based on available published evidence scored according to the GRADE system for quality and strength of evidence. If the quality of evidence was low or very low, the proposed recommendations resulted from the experts' collective decision, this information being provided in the document. A final version of the consensus document (corrections and amendments performed according to the results of the BPM) was reviewed by the drafting team, circulated among the BPM participants for revision and further amendments and was finally approved by the EMQN board.

The BPM provided the opportunity not only to discuss the controversial topics previously reviewed through the systematic literature search and its implications for future research (described above), but also to discuss some other relevant topics described here.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^117GZvjU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders among persons of northern European descent. There have been recent advances in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HH. The availability of molecular diagnostic testing for HH has made possible confirmation of the diagnosis for most patients. Several genotype-phenotype correlation studies have clarified the differences in clinical features between patients with the C282Y homozygous genotypes and other HFE mutation patterns. The increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients. Serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease. These diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. A secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, but emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: rapid evidence review [^1169ycLm]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts iron homeostasis, resulting in systemic iron overload. It is the most common inherited disorder among people of northern European ancestry. Despite the high prevalence of the gene mutation, there is a low and variable clinical penetrance. The deposition of excess iron into parenchymal cells leads to cellular dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The liver, pancreas, joints, heart, skin, and pituitary gland are the most commonly involved organs. Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually diagnosed in the 40s or 50s. Women are often diagnosed later than men, likely because of menstrual blood loss. There is no typical presentation or pathognomonic signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because of increased awareness and earlier diagnosis, the end-organ damage secondary to iron overload is not often seen in clinical practice. A common initial presentation is an asymptomatic patient with mildly elevated liver enzymes who is subsequently found to have elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferritin levels greater than 300 ng per mL for men and 200 ng per mL for women and transferrin saturations greater than 45% are highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and can help improve heart function, reduce abnormal skin pigmentation, and lessen the risk of liver complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in select patients. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal and breast cancers. Genetic testing for the hereditary hemochromatosis genes should be offered after 18 years of age to first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

### A 6-year survey of HFE gene test for hemochromatosis diagnosis [^115pSSV7]. Genetics in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

A 6-year survey of HFE gene test was conducted to evaluate its helpfulness for hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosis.

Methods

We analyzed C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations on 3525 individuals.

Results

The test produced 89.7% and 30% of positive results for individuals clinically diagnosed hemochromatosis before HFE gene-test availability and those prospectively tested because of elevated serum iron parameter and/or family history, respectively; among them there were 90.4% and 48.7% of C282Y homozygotes.

Conclusions

The HFE gene test confirmed a genetic defect that may lead to iron loading in individuals when iron parameter values, especially for the C282Y/C282Y, were still low as well as for genotypes usually associated with low expressivity and penetrance (C282Y/H63D, H63D/H63D). This gene-test should allow a biochemical follow-up of patients carrying a disease-related genotype.

### Recognition and management of hereditary hemochromatosis [^116j2dEx]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited single-gene disorder in people of northern European descent. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, with deposition of the iron in multiple organs. Previously, the classic description was combined diabetes mellitus, cutaneous hyperpigmentation and cirrhosis. Increasingly, however, hereditary hemochromatosis is being diagnosed at an earlier, less symptomatic stage. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory and pathologic findings, including elevated serum transferrin saturation. Life expectancy is usually normal if phlebotomy is initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE gene. Between 60 and 93 percent of patients with the disorder are homozygous for a mutation designated C282Y. The HFE gene test is useful in confirming the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, screening adult family members of patients with HFE mutations and resolving ambiguities concerning iron overload.

### Hemochromatosis [^112Xu6KT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis is an inheritable condition that mainly affects White populations of European descent. Most patients remain asymptomatic, but others develop advanced organ damage that reduces quality of life and long-term survival. Arthropathy, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and cardiomyopathy are key clinical manifestations. Primary care and hospital medicine physicians play an essential role in early identification of this disease, which can be accomplished via standard hematologic testing. Early diagnosis and therapeutic phlebotomy improve clinical outcomes.

### Screening for hemochromatosis: recommendation… [^116ER3E7]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations on screening for hemochromatosis and the supporting scientific evidence. Explanations of the ratings and of the strength of overall evidence are given in. Summary of Recommendations The USPSTF recommends against routine genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis in the asymptomatic general population. D recommendation. RATIONALE Importance There is fair evidence that disease caused by hereditary hemochromatosis is rare in the general population. Detection The USPSTF found fair evidence that a low proportion of persons with a high-risk genotype manifest the disease. Persons with a family member, especially a sibling, who is known to have hereditary hemochromatosis may be more likely to develop symptoms.

These persons should be counseled regarding genotyping, with further diagnostic testing as warranted as part of case-finding. In addition to genotyping, more common laboratory testing can sometimes identify iron overload. Clinical screening with these laboratory tests, or phenotypic screening, was not included in the evidence synthesis on which this recommendation is based. Genotyping primarily focuses on the identification of the. C282Ymutation on HFE. Although other mutations exist, C282Yhomozygosity is most commonly associated with clinical manifestations. Identifying a person with the genotypic predisposition does not accurately predict the future risk of disease manifestation. Recommendations of Others Other groups have reviewed the utility of screening for hereditary hemochromatosis.

The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention does not recommend universal testing for hereditary hemochromatosis but rather suggests evaluating iron overload in persons with a family history, and in symptomatic persons. 2 The American College of Physicians found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels to identify early stages of hereditary hemochromatosis. 3 The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Gastroenterological Association recommend genotyping persons who have abnormal iron screening tests and first-degree relatives of those identified with C282Y homozygosity. 4.

### Iron overload in the liver diagnostic and quantification [^117GAFM3]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis is the most frequent modality of iron overload. Since 1996 genetic tests have facilitated significantly the non-invasive diagnosis of the disease. There are however many cases of negative genetic tests that require confirmation by hepatic iron quantification which is traditionally performed by hepatic biopsy. There are many studies that have demonstrated the possibility of performing hepatic iron quantification with Magnetic Resonance. However, a consensus has not been reached yet regarding the technique or the possibility to reproduce the same method of calculus in different machines. This article reviews the state of the art of the question and delineates possible future lines to standardise this non-invasive method of hepatic iron quantification.

### Genetics, genetic testing, and management of hemochromatosis: 15 years since hepcidin [^114iYQ1K]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The discovery of hepcidin in 2000 and the subsequent unprecedented explosion of research and discoveries in the iron field have dramatically changed our understanding of human disorders of iron metabolism. Today, hereditary hemochromatosis, the paradigmatic iron-loading disorder, is recognized as an endocrine disease due to the genetic loss of hepcidin, the iron hormone produced by the liver. This syndrome is due to unchecked transfer of iron into the bloodstream in the absence of increased erythropoietic needs and its toxic effects in parenchymatous organs. It is caused by mutations that affect any of the proteins that help hepcidin to monitor serum iron, including HFE and, in rarer instances, transferrin-receptor 2 and hemojuvelin, or make its receptor ferroportin, resistant to the hormone. In Caucasians, C282Y HFE homozygotes are numerous, but they are only predisposed to hemochromatosis; complete organ disease develops in a minority, due to alcohol abuse or concurrent genetic modifiers that are now being identified. HFE gene testing can be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in symptomatic patients, but analyses of liver histology and full gene sequencing are required to identify patients with rare, non-HFE forms of the disease. Due to the central pathogenic role of hepcidin, it is anticipated that nongenetic causes of hepcidin loss (eg, end-stage liver disease) can cause acquired forms of hemochromatosis. The mainstay of hemochromatosis management is still removal of iron by phlebotomy, first introduced in 1950s, but identification of hepcidin has not only shed new light on the pathogenesis of the disease and the approach to diagnosis, but etiologic therapeutic applications from these advances are now foreseen.

### Haemochromatosis: find them or forget about them? [^1135XDxL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Haemochromatosis continues to be considered an uncommon disease despite large scale population screening studies demonstrating a high prevalence of C282Y homozygotes of approximately 1 in 200. Since many of the C282Y homozygotes that are discovered through screening are asymptomatic, or have non-specific symptoms commonly found in the ageing population, the attribution of any symptoms to haemochromatosis has become increasingly difficult. The demonstration of significant liver disease in family members is a strong reminder of the vital importance of pedigree studies when a typical haemochromatosis patient is identified.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^113JRzAH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Molecular genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is recognized as a reference test to confirm the diagnosis of suspected HH or to predict its risk. The vast majority (typically > 90%) of patients with clinically characterized HH are homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in the HFE gene, referred to as HFE-related HH. Since 1996, HFE genotyping was implemented in diagnostic algorithms for suspected HH, allowing its early diagnosis and prevention. However, the penetrance of disease in p.C282Y homozygotes is incomplete. Hence, homozygosity for p.C282Y is not sufficient to diagnose HH. Neither is p.C282Y homozygosity required for diagnosis as other rare forms of HH exist, generally referred to as non-HFE-related HH. These pose significant challenges when defining criteria for referral, testing protocols, interpretation of test results and reporting practices. We present best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of HH where recommendations are classified, as far as possible, according to the level and strength of evidence. For clarification, the guidelines' recommendations are preceded by a detailed description of the methodology and results obtained with a series of actions taken in order to achieve a wide expert consensus, namely: (i) a survey on the current practices followed by laboratories offering molecular diagnosis of HH; (ii) a systematic literature search focused on some identified controversial topics; (iii) an expert Best Practice Workshop convened to achieve consensus on the practical recommendations included in the guidelines.

### Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11195ASM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are difficult because of the variable penetrance of mutations of the HFE gene and the absence of any definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities. The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing. This guideline provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience for this guideline is internists and other primary care physicians. The target patient population is all persons who have a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including the relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

For efficiency, "both genotype (HFE mutation analysis) and phenotype (ferritin and TS) should be performed simultaneously at a single visit". For children, "HFE testing of the other parent is generally recommended, because if results are normal, the child is an obligate heterozygote and need not undergo further testing because there is no increased risk of iron loading".

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^111NiA8Y]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

When a diagnosis of HFE-related hemochromatosis is established in a proband, genetic screening of asymptomatic siblings, or other first-degree relatives, is a cost-effective strategy to enhance case detection and early diagnosis. Genetic screening of the general population is not recommended because of the low penetrance of the disease. Although biochemical evidence of iron overload usually precedes symptomatic disease, biochemical population screening for iron overload is also not recommended because large studies have failed to show its cost-effectiveness. However, the true prevalence of symptomatic HH in the general population, in particular in European populations, is also unknown, which increases the uncertainty of cost-efficiency analyses.

### Impact of gene patents and licensing practices on access to genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis [^111cPTYA]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron metabolism disorder that leads to excess iron buildup, especially in the heart, liver, and pancreas. Mutations in the HFE gene are the single most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis, which can be treated effectively if diagnosed early. Patents cover the HFE gene, related proteins, screening methods, and testing kits. Most initial testing for hereditary hemochromatosis is biochemical, but HFE deoxyribonucleic acid testing or genotyping is used to confirm a diagnosis of inherited hemochromatosis. Concerns over patents covering HFE testing emerged in 2002, when scholars argued that exclusive licensing and the patent-enabled sole provider model then in place led to high prices and limited access. Critics of the sole provider model noted that the test was available at multiple laboratories before the enforcement of patents. By 2007, however, Bio-Rad Limited, acquired the key intellectual property and sublicensed it widely. In part because of broad, nonexclusive licensing, there are now multiple providers and testing technologies, and research continues. This case study illustrates how both changes in intellectual property ownership and evolving clinical utility of HFE genetic testing in the last decade have effected the licensing of patents and availability of genetic testing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis [^1146DJTB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis is not a new disease, and genetic variants for hemochromatosis have been identified in human fossils that are over 4000 years old in North Western Europe. 1 These variants were postulated to promote iron absorption as a survival benefit. In contrast, excess iron absorption can lead to serious complications, including arthritis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, and diabetes. In this review, the emphasis is on recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis, focusing on those homozygous for the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. In this condition, there is a clear need for earlier diagnosis, leading to earlier treatment, to prevent morbidity and mortality from iron overload.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^113TBNGN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — genetic testing practices and mutation prevalence: In 1996, Feder et al. reported the identification of a hemochromatosis mutation in a novel MHC class I–like gene that was present in 83% of subjects with clinically defined HH, and genotyping for HFE mutations (C282Y) is now standard of care for the evaluation of patients in whom HH is suspected on clinical grounds or based on the finding of elevated iron studies. The H63D mutation is more common than C282Y and is found in most populations worldwide, with the highest prevalence among whites of whom approximately 26% carry at least 1 copy of H63D, whereas the S65C mutation is less common with a heterozygote frequency of about 2% among whites. Neither the homozygous nor the heterozygous H63D or S65C mutation is a cause of pathologic iron overload. We recommend that individuals with the H63D or S65C mutation in the absence of C282Y mutation should be counseled that they are not at increased risk of iron overload (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO question: Should testing for non-HFE genes vs not testing be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in those who are negative for the C282Y or H63D alleles?

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1113JdAg]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) — general population screening is not indicated or recommended; evidence includes limited clinical penetrance and low cirrhosis prevalence in population studies. Approximately 30% of C282Y homozygotes do not have phenotypic expression of excess iron stores in cross-sectional studies, and in a large Norwegian study, 65,238 subjects were screened using transferrin saturation with confirmatory testing as needed; in 147 subjects who underwent liver biopsy, only four men and none of the women had cirrhosis (2.7% prevalence of cirrhosis). An Australian population study of 3011 individuals revealed 16 C282Y homozygotes, of whom 11 with serum ferritin > 300 μg/L underwent liver biopsy, identifying five with advanced fibrosis and one with cirrhosis (6.3% prevalence of cirrhosis). Economic models have suggested screening would be effective only if 20% developed life-threatening complications, and long-term observational data followed patients for 25 years. Because of these considerations, general population screening for HH is not indicated, widespread population screening for HH is not recommended, and the guideline states: Average risk population screening for HH is not recommended.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: time for targeted screening [^113pQ7M7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The discovery of the HFE gene in 1996 heralded a decade of major advances in the understanding of the mechanisms that control iron absorption and body iron stores. A genetic definition of the common form of hereditary hemochromatosis became possible, and testing for the common causative HFE mutations is now widely available in clinical laboratories. Several population screening studies have confirmed that disease penetrance in HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis is lower than previously believed, making universal population-based screening for this disorder unattractive. However, hereditary hemochromatosis may still cause morbidity and mortality because of iron overload. Early detection and use of appropriate therapy can prevent these manifestations and can only be achieved by targeted case finding. In this article, the authors draw attention again to hereditary hemochromatosis as a cause of preventable organ dysfunction and propose targeted case finding for Caucasian men of Northern European ancestry.

### Iron overload: what is the role of public health? [^113c4YGZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis classical (HHC), is an iron overload disorder associated, in most cases, with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Although suggested algorithms for diagnosing iron overload are available, there are still questions about options for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and duration of treatment. This article provides a summary of an expert workgroup meeting convened on September 24–25, 2009, entitled "Iron Overload: What is the Role of Public Health?" The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the role of public health in this field. The two main topics were the research priorities of the field, including clinical, genetic, and public health issues, and the concerns about the validity of current screening recommendations for the condition.

The management and understanding of hereditary hemochromatosis have evolved with recent advances in iron biology and the associated discovery of numerous genes involved in iron metabolism. HFE-related (type 1) hemochromatosis remains the most frequent form, characterized by C282Y mutation homozygosity. Rare forms of hereditary hemochromatosis include type 2 (A and B, juvenile hemochromatosis caused by HJV and HAMP mutation), type 3 (related to TFR2 mutation), and type 4 (A and B, ferroportin disease). The diagnostic evaluation relies on comprehension of the involved pathophysiologic defect, and careful characterization of the phenotype, which gives clues to guide appropriate genetic testing.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. HH can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (TS, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide some further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

Fig. 3
An algorithm can provide some further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin (Table 7). TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. In some laboratories, the total iron-binding capacity is calculated from the sum of the serum iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, whereas in others, it is calculated indirectly from the transferrin concentration in the serum. A recent study, using fasting samples, has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes. Accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Over the years, different studies have used a variety of cutoff values for TS to identify patients eligible for further testing. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values. Thus, using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, and these cases will require further evaluation.

Preamble

These recommendations provide a data-supported approach to establishing guidelines. They are based on the following: (1) a formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic; (2) the American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines; (3) guideline policies including the AASLD Policy on the Development and Use of Practice Guidelines and the American Gastroenterological Association's Policy Statement on the Use of Medical Practice Guidelines; and (4) the experience of the authors in regard to hemochromatosis.

To more fully characterize the available evidence supporting the recommendations, the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup with minor modifications (Table 1). The strength of recommendations in the GRADE system are classified as strong (class 1) or weak (class 2). The quality of evidence supporting strong or weak recommendations is designated by one of three levels: high (level A), moderate (level B), or low-quality (level C).

Table 1

### Hemochromatosis: genetic testing and clinical practice [^115RMQMK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The availability of a facile treatment for hemochromatosis renders early diagnosis of iron overload syndromes mandatory, and in many instances genetic testing allows identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical disease before pathologic iron storage occurs. Numerous proteins implicated in iron homeostasis have recently come to light, and defects in the cognate genes are associated with iron storage. Although most adult patients with hereditary iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, an increasing number with hereditary iron storage have an HFE genotype not characteristic of the disease. Heterozygosity for mutations in the gene encoding ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is probably the second most common genetic cause of hereditary iron storage in adults; here the primarily affected cell is the macrophage. Rare defects, including mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene, have also been identified in pedigrees affected with "non-HFE hemochromatosis". Homozygous mutations in the newly identified genes encoding hemojuvelin (HFE2) and hepcidin (HAMP) cause juvenile hemochromatosis. At the same time, heterozygosity for mutations in these genes can modify the clinical expression of iron storage in patients predisposed to iron storage in adult life. Hemochromatosis might thus be considered as a polygenic disease with strong environmental influences on its clinical expression. As our mechanistic understanding of iron pathophysiology improves, our desire to integrate clinical decision making with the results of laboratory tests and molecular analysis of human genes poses increasing challenges.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis [^1157Rj5X]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.

Results of a systematic literature search on controversial topics

The expert team drafted a document that served as the discussion basis for the final guidelines. For most issues addressed, the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations had been already assessed elsewhere, according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (short GRADE) Working Group. For consistency, those scores were used in this guidelines document accordingly. For some controversial topics, however, we performed a systemic review of the literature. These topics were: (i) The clinical value of testing for p.H63D; (ii) Role, efficacy and efficiency of cascade screening; and (iii) Follow-up of unaffected p.C282Y homozygotes and p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes. For the systematic review, research questions were formulated for each topic. For each specific question, search terms were phrased as PICO (Patient, Intervention, Control and Outcome) that guided the searches in both MEDLINE and EMBASE using Medical Subject Headings (MESH) and free text words. Searches were limited to those written in English, but were not restricted to date.

The clinical value of testing for p.H63D

This was a pending question since the publication of the previous guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of Type I (HFE-related) HHwhere the authors raised the question of an eventual call for an 'iron overload' genetic screen as opposed to an HFE genetic screen. As evidenced by the present survey results concerning the question about testing for p.H63D, there is still much confusion among clinicians and laboratory scientists regarding the use of HFE variants (particularly p.H63D) as disease susceptibility markers.

In order to determine the diagnostic utility of p.H63D testing, a systematic review of the literature was performed. Search terms according to the following PICO were phrased: Patients (P) were individuals with hemochromatosis or patients with iron overload. Intervention (I) was genotyping of the p.H63D variant of the HFE gene. Controls (C) were newborns or population based screening and Outcome (O) was the report of genotype frequency. With this search strategy, 931 references were retrieved. From these, 33 studies were selected as case–control studies where the hemochromatosis case definition was considered appropriate. In addition, 37 population-based screening studies were selected.

### Strategies for early diagnosis of haemochromatosis [^1146pthS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Genetic haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism. Only patients with early non-cirrhotic haemochromatosis treated by phlebotomies have a normal life expectancy. The present review analyses strategies for early diagnosis of haemochromatosis by using the Medline database and own data from a large cohort of patients with haemochromatosis. The still widely used approach to look for haemochromatosis in the presence of clinical complications such as liver disease will detect haemochromatosis in a considerable percentage of patients with Celtic origin. However, up to one half of these patients will already have an irreversible complication such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus or cardiomyopathy. In contrast, screening approaches of non-selected asymptomatic subjects using either determination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin (phenotypic screening) or using genetic testing will detect haemochromatosis in most subjects in a precirrhotic stage without irreversible complications. Both phenotypic and genetic screening are highly cost-effective for detection of iron-loaded individuals in the general population. The current clinical approach to look for haemochromatosis in the presence of clinical disease is unacceptable. Only a more general type of screening in asymptomatic subjects including genetic testing will increase the rate of early diagnosis and will further improve the clinical outcome.

Originally regarded as a rare affliction notable for its distinctive evolution to "bronze diabetes", hereditary hemochromatosis is now recognized as the most common genetic disorder in populations of European ancestry. Recent advances in our understanding of iron metabolism, the identification of the gene responsible for hemochromatosis, and large epidemiologic studies have changed the diagnostic approach toward patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and other forms of iron overload. This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic testing, and management of hemochromatosis for the primary care provider.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

### Current approaches to the management of hemochromatosis [^112vMwGF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

The term hemochromatosis encompasses at least four types of genetic iron overload conditions, most of them recently distinguished from one another as a result of the identification of a series of genes related to iron metabolism. At least three of these entities (HFE hemochromatosis, juvenile hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor 2 hemochromatosis) involve systemic hepcidin deficiency as a key pathogenetic factor. Major advances in the management of hemochromatosis influence the diagnostic approach to the disease, with the development of an overall non invasive strategy, mainly based on clinical, biological (iron parameters and genetic testing), and imaging (especially magnetic resonance imaging) data. Therapeutic management remains, on the curative side, dominated by phlebotomy (venesection), practical aspects of which have been recently revisited by the Guidelines Department of the French "Haute Autorité de Santé". However, innovative treatment approaches, based on the improved pathophysiological understanding of these diseases and the progress in iron chelation therapy, are emerging. Preventive therapy, focused on family screening, remains a key part of the management of hemochromatosis.

Methods and testing strategies

A variety of methods for HFE genotyping are in use by laboratories participating in the EMQN EQA scheme for HFE HH. The most common testing strategies in use detect the p.C282Y (c.845G > A) and p.H63D (c.187C > G) variants and are based on PCR/restriction enzyme digestion or various allele-specific amplification strategies.

The vast majority of HFE -related hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for p.C282Y. p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygosity may be a risk factor predisposing to mild or moderate forms of iron overload when in association with comorbidity factors, for example, alcohol or metabolic syndrome. The association of homozygosity for p.H63D with iron overload is debated and requires further clinical research, but it is now recommended that other risk factors or other genetic causes should be sought and investigated in patients with this genotype and demonstrated iron overload. Testing for these two HFE variants can be performed either sequentially or simultaneously. Sequential testing, starting with p.C282Y, will avoid detection of p.H63D homozygotes, and this has been considered by most experts as an advantage. However, this reflex testing approach increases the turn-around time and overall cost. A simultaneous testing strategy should be weighed against the possibility of creating anxiety or unnecessary investigation. The laboratory should take these factors into account when deciding to use this strategy. In any case, when a method detects both variants concurrently, which is generally the case, there is an obligation to report the complete result.

There is no supporting evidence for a role of the p.S65C variant (c.193A > T) in clinically manifest HH (p.S65C is a normal variant in the general European population). Therefore, testing for the p.S65C variant is not recommended for diagnostic purposes; if detected as an incidental finding, it should not be reported to avoid possible over-interpretation of its significance.

Guidelines from the European Society of Human Genetics and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend not testing minors for carrier status for late-onset disorders. When requested by parents in this situation, local and international practice and regulations should be followed/recommended by the health careers.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

The guidelines — evidence-based recommendations

These guidelines offer an overview of the recommended basis for genetic testing referral where there is a suspicion of type 1 HH or rare forms of HFE -related and non -HFE -related HH, along with predictive testing of adult first-degree relatives of subjects confirmed to have HH by molecular analysis. They illustrate the minimum expected interpretation standards for these disorders where the correlation between the clinical phenotype and genotype must be considered prior to referral for investigation and reporting.

Reporting scenarios

The following provides basic guidelines for reporting HFE test results based on reasons for referral and resulting genotypes. Points regarded as essential are highlighted in italics. It should be stressed that these guidelines are presented under the assumption that HFE genotyping is performed to confirm, exclude or predict the most common HFE -related forms of HH and they do not cover rare or population-specific alternative variants in HFE. Other forms of iron overload and other types of HH exist and further investigation may be suggested where relevant clinical and biochemical features indicate. In those rare cases with a strongly suggestive phenotype that are not confirmed to be p.C282Y homozygous, investigation for other genetic forms of HH or referral to a specialist unit may be suggested. However, it must be stressed that these are rare and should only be considered in cases where there is a documented severe iron overload that remains unexplained after exclusion of other causes. Reference to the implications of the HFE test result for other adult family members and recommendations for genetic counselling should be reserved only for individuals carrying the p.C282Y variant; otherwise it may create unnecessary anxiety. In cases where screening is performed with additional genetic and/or phenotypic data, reporting recommendations may be adapted to reflect individual case scenarios more closely. A summary of basic interpretive comments relating to HFE-related HH is given in Table 2.

### Who should be screened for hemochromatosis? [^112tWHun]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis should be suspected in patients with generalized weakness and arthralgias, because these are early nonspecific symptoms of the condition. It definitely should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with hepatomegaly, increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, impotence, infertility, increased skin pigmentation, cardiomyopathy, diabetes types 1 and 2, and cardiac arrhythmias. The other group to be considered for screening includes relatives of patients diagnosed with hemochromatosis. The recommended screening test is determination of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Hemochromatosis should be suspected if ferritin levels are 300 ng per mL or higher in men and 200 ng per mL or higher in women, but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be elevated in several acute conditions.

Transferrin saturation is reported to be 94 percent sensitive in diagnosing C282Y hemochromatosis and is most accurate when measured while the patient is fasting. Iron overload is possible at levels of greater than 50 percent in men and greater than 45 percent in women. Genetic testing is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in all people with abnormal transferrin saturation or ferritin levels and all first-degree relatives of C282Y homozygotes. Siblings of homozygous persons have a one in four chance of being homozygous themselves, and children of homozygous persons have a chance of about one in 20. Since genetic testing became available, liver biopsy is less important for diagnosis and now is used mainly to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is considered in C282Y homozygous persons who have liver dysfunction.

as shown by AST levels greater than 40 U per L or ferritin levels greater than 1, 000 ng per mL. Cirrhosis is a serious prognostic finding because phlebotomy does not reverse the cirrhotic process. These patients have a 200-fold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
