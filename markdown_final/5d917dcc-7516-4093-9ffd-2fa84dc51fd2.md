## Question

When to do imaging in infant with UTI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to image infants with febrile urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the infant's age and whether guideline frameworks apply. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria for UTI and the quality of the urine specimen. Next, I will assess illness severity and clinical context to decide on the timing of renal and bladder ultrasound. After that, I need to determine when to escalate to VCUG and when a DMSA scan is appropriate. Finally, I should consider special populations, follow-up, and how to reconcile differing guideline perspectives before summarizing a practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the age framework, because this dictates which guideline applies. The AAP 2011 guideline explicitly addresses febrile infants 2 to 24 months, and its 2016 reaffirmation supports selective imaging with reduced radiation exposure, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize to neonates or those under 2 months where evidence is thinner and practice often differs [^113wtdNf] [^116vuVDP]. Wait, let me verify whether the AAP guidance can be extrapolated to infants under 2 months; a cohort study suggests laboratory and RBUS recommendations may be safely applied to infants under 2 months, but VCUG indications remain less certain in this group, so I should keep that caveat in mind [^113BKhUR]. In contrast, EAU/ESPU 2025 recommends renal and bladder ultrasound within 24 hours for infants with febrile UTI and acutely ill children, which supports early ultrasound in younger or sicker infants regardless of the AAP's original scope [^1177NfAX].

> I need to ensure the diagnosis is truly a febrile UTI using appropriate criteria. Diagnosis requires both pyuria and at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen from a catheterized or suprapubic specimen; bagged specimens are unreliable for culture due to high false-positive rates, so I should double-check the collection method before labeling this a UTI [^114k747H] [^1121mZzi]. Hold on, I should verify that the culture threshold and urinalysis elements are present; if either is missing, I should reconsider the diagnosis or repeat testing before committing to an imaging pathway [^114k747H].

> Next, I should review illness severity and clinical context to decide on imaging timing. If the infant is severely ill, not improving as expected, has concerns for obstruction or abscess, or is very young, I should obtain renal and bladder ultrasound early, ideally within the first 1 to 2 days of treatment, to evaluate for complications or urgent urologic issues. If the infant is clinically improving, deferring ultrasound until after acute treatment is reasonable [^1174SWeg] [^1177NfAX]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance; delaying RBUS by several days may reduce false-positive dilation from transient inflammatory changes, but I need to balance this against the risk of missing an obstruction or abscess in a deteriorating patient, so clinical judgment is key here [^111mhKXB] [^1174SWeg].

> I will now examine the role of RBUS after a first febrile UTI. The AAP recommends RBUS for all febrile infants 2 to 24 months after a first UTI to detect anatomic abnormalities, with the understanding that actionable findings occur in about 1% to 2% and false positives in 2% to 3%, which still justifies the test given the potential to uncover surgically correctable problems [^112pbeqA] [^1174SWeg]. Hold on, I should verify whether universal RBUS changes management; a randomized trial in young children found that early ultrasound rarely altered management, but guideline bodies still endorse RBUS for infants because it detects clinically significant anomalies and establishes baseline renal size for follow-up, even if low yield [^112UoNd1] [^112pbeqA].

> Now, I should determine when to add VCUG. VCUG is not recommended routinely after a first febrile UTI. It is indicated if RBUS shows hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings suggesting high-grade VUR or obstruction, or if there is recurrence of febrile UTI, atypical features, or complex clinical circumstances [^117GSfFV] [^1177ZMCx]. Let me think about the yield and trade-offs; waiting for recurrence to trigger VCUG reduces radiation and invasive testing for most infants, and although some low-grade VUR may be missed, the clinically important grade IV–V VUR is more likely to surface with recurrence or abnormal ultrasound, aligning with a selective strategy [^114w7X7k] [^1177ZMCx]. But wait, what if the infant is under 2 months; given higher VUR prevalence in very young infants, some centers obtain VCUG more readily, so I should individualize based on age, sex, pathogen, and ultrasound findings rather than apply a rigid rule [^1139XM6y].

> I should confirm the role and timing of DMSA scintigraphy. DMSA is not part of routine first-UTI evaluation; it is best reserved for recurrent febrile UTI, abnormal ultrasound suggesting parenchymal involvement, or when documenting renal scarring would change long-term management or surveillance, ideally performed 3 to 6 months after the acute episode to distinguish acute inflammatory changes from permanent scarring [^111gzdvH] [^111G7rMD]. Hold on, I should verify whether acute-phase DMSA helps; while acute DMSA can identify pyelonephritis, it rarely changes immediate management and is not recommended routinely after a first febrile UTI in otherwise well infants [^1174SWeg] [^111G7rMD].

> Let me consider special populations and risk modifiers. In infants under 2 months, the AAP guideline did not originally provide firm recommendations, but observational data suggest that diagnostic and RBUS practices from the 2 to 24 month group can be extrapolated with caution, while VCUG decisions should be individualized given higher VUR prevalence and the need to exclude posterior urethral valves in boys with poor stream or elevated residuals [^113BKhUR] [^116UVaz1]. I should double-check for predictors of abnormal imaging in very young infants; non–E. coli organisms and bacteremia have been associated with imaging abnormalities and recurrence, which can lower my threshold for VCUG in select cases [^1124rX8k] [^113QzyVn]. For infants with known antenatal hydronephrosis or other congenital anomalies, imaging decisions often follow urology protocols rather than standard first-UTI algorithms, so I need to ensure I am not missing a preexisting condition that warrants early VCUG or specialized follow-up [^115HwJ2z].

> Next, I should review follow-up and recurrence planning. Parents should be instructed to seek prompt medical evaluation within 48 hours for future febrile illnesses so that recurrent UTIs are diagnosed and treated quickly, as delays increase the risk of renal scarring. This counseling is a core component of guideline-concordant care [^111G7rMD] [^117EQ1hM]. Wait, let me verify the scarring risk data; scarring risk rises with delayed treatment beyond 48 to 72 hours and accumulates with recurrences, reinforcing the importance of early recognition and selective but timely imaging when recurrence occurs [^114iMW1o] [^114fcMVu].

> I need to reconcile differing guideline perspectives to avoid overtesting. The AAP emphasizes selective imaging with RBUS for all first febrile UTIs in 2 to 24 months and VCUG only selectively, balancing low yield, cost, and radiation. NICE restricts routine ultrasound to infants under 6 months or atypical cases, reflecting cost-effectiveness concerns. EAU/ESPU supports early ultrasound in infants and acutely ill children and a selective VCUG approach, especially in those under 1 year with recurrence or abnormal ultrasound [^113wtdNf] [^111G7rMD] [^1177NfAX] [^1139XM6y]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. While some surgical literature argues for more aggressive detection of VUR, contemporary pediatric literature and comparative analyses show minimal outcome benefit from routine VCUG after a first UTI, supporting the selective strategy endorsed by AAP and EAU in most infants [^116N7Zy1] [^117L7fki].

> Putting this together, my practical algorithm is as follows. First, confirm febrile UTI with pyuria and at least 50,000 CFU/mL from a catheterized or suprapubic specimen; if criteria are not met, reassess or repeat testing. Second, obtain renal and bladder ultrasound for all infants with a first febrile UTI, timing it early if the infant is severely ill, not improving, very young, or has concerning features, and otherwise after acute treatment when stable. Third, if RBUS is abnormal or there is recurrence of febrile UTI, proceed to VCUG; if RBUS is normal and there is no recurrence, defer VCUG. Fourth, consider DMSA 3 to 6 months after the acute episode for recurrent febrile UTI, abnormal ultrasound suggesting parenchymal involvement, or when documenting scarring would change management. Finally, provide parent education on prompt fever evaluation for recurrences and arrange follow-up to ensure timely treatment and selective imaging if UTIs recur [^114k747H] [^112pbeqA] [^117GSfFV] [^111gzdvH] [^114fcMVu].

Imaging is indicated in infants with UTI to detect **anatomic abnormalities** [^112pbeqA] and guide management [^117W3So1]. Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) is recommended after the **first febrile UTI** in infants 2–24 months [^113wtdNf] to identify hydronephrosis, scarring, or obstruction [^114fcMVu]; if RBUS is abnormal or if there is a **recurrent febrile UTI**, a VCUG is indicated to assess for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [^117GSfFV] [^1177ZMCx]. DMSA is reserved for **recurrent UTIs** [^111gzdvH], **abnormal RBUS**, or **persistent renal dysfunction** to detect renal scarring or parenchymal defects [^111G7rMD]. Routine imaging is not required for **older children with a single, uncomplicated UTI** [^111G7rMD] [^117L7fki]. Imaging should be **individualized** based on age, clinical presentation, and risk factors [^117W3So1].

## Indications for imaging in infants with UTI

Imaging is **not universally required** for all infants with UTI; indications depend on age, clinical presentation, and risk factors [^111G7rMD]. The following scenarios **warrant imaging**:

- **First febrile UTI**: RBUS is recommended for infants aged 2–24 months [^113wtdNf] to detect anatomic abnormalities [^112pbeqA] such as hydronephrosis, scarring, or obstruction [^113wtdNf].

- **Recurrent febrile UTI**: VCUG is indicated after a second febrile UTI [^114w7X7k] or if RBUS reveals abnormalities suggestive of high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy [^1177ZMCx].

- **Atypical or complicated UTI**: Imaging is indicated for atypical presentations (e.g. poor response to therapy, unusual pathogens, persistent fever) [^117W3So1] or complicated infections (e.g. abscess, obstruction) [^116SCarT].

---

## Recommended imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) | - First febrile UTI in infants 2–24 months [^113wtdNf] <br/> - Abnormal RBUS or recurrent UTI [^notfound] | - Detect anatomic abnormalities [^112pbeqA] <br/> - Hydronephrosis <br/> - Scarring <br/> - Obstruction [^111G7rMD] |
| Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) | - Abnormal RBUS [^117GSfFV] <br/> - Recurrent febrile UTI [^1177ZMCx] <br/> - Suspected VUR | Detect and grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [^111G7rMD] |
| Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan | - Recurrent UTI [^111gzdvH] <br/> - Abnormal RBUS <br/> - Persistent renal dysfunction | Detect renal scarring or parenchymal defects [^111G7rMD] |

---

## Timing of imaging

Timing of imaging **depends on clinical context**. RBUS is generally performed after the acute infection has been treated and the infant is clinically stable [^114fcMVu]; however, if the infant is severely ill or fails to improve, early imaging within the first 2 days of treatment may be warranted [^1174SWeg]. VCUG is typically performed after RBUS if abnormalities are detected or if there is a **recurrent febrile UTI** [^117GSfFV]. DMSA scanning is usually performed 3–6 months after the acute infection to assess for **renal scarring** [^111gzdvH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Recommends RBUS after the first febrile UTI in infants 2–24 months [^113wtdNf]; VCUG is indicated if RBUS is abnormal or if there is a recurrent febrile UTI [^112DdLnD].

- **European Association of Urology (EAU)**: Recommends renal and bladder ultrasound within 24 hours for infants with febrile UTI, especially if acutely ill [^1177NfAX].

- **American College of Radiology (ACR)**: Emphasizes selective imaging based on clinical presentation, age, and risk factors, with RBUS as the initial study [^116UVaz1].

---

## Risks and benefits of imaging

Imaging provides essential information about underlying **anatomic abnormalities**, guiding management and preventing complications [^117W3So1]. However, it also carries risks, including radiation exposure (VCUG), sedation requirements, and potential false positives leading to unnecessary interventions [^116vuVDP]. Therefore, **imaging decisions should balance benefits and risks**, considering individual patient factors [^112v4RvZ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Imaging in infants with UTI should be **individualized** based on age, clinical presentation, and risk factors [^117W3So1]. RBUS is recommended after the first febrile UTI in infants 2–24 months [^113wtdNf], with VCUG and DMSA reserved for specific indications such as abnormal RBUS, recurrent febrile UTI, or persistent renal dysfunction [^111mvZZi]. Routine imaging is not required for older children with a single, uncomplicated UTI [^111G7rMD].

Discussion

When considering further testing following confirmation of UTI, it is important to bear in mind clinical aim. If the information derived cannot be used to prevent renal disease there is little benefit in testing. Tests should only be conducted if (a) the results will lead to a change in management and (b) this change is likely to lead to an improved outcome. For this reason, the ideal study would be a randomised controlled trial of different testing strategies, or no testing. We identified only one such study, and this was only available as an abstract reporting limited information, and we were unsuccessful in obtaining further details. Our results are therefore primarily derived from diagnostic accuracy studies, which assume the validity of the clinical aims of current testing.

Localisation of infection can be considered a first step in the investigation of UTI. Lower UTI does not involve the kidneys and so cannot lead to renal scarring. Children with lower UTI are therefore unlikely to benefit from immediate investigation. Given that therapeutic delay is thought to be associated with renal damage, the possibility that they may benefit from monitoring for recurrence remains open to question. The ideal test to localise infection would be non-invasive, inexpensive, and quick to perform. Further investigation of children with infections of the lower urinary tract could thus be avoided. Our results do not support the use of any of the minimally invasive tests evaluated as alternatives to renal scintigraphy for the localisation of infection. However, the available evidence was limited, and further primary research in this area would be useful. Testing with the specific aim of localisation of infection is not common in current practice. Baseline renal scintigraphy in all children with confirmed UTI, in whom further investigation is planned, may be beneficial. This approach would eliminate a substantial proportion of children from further invasive investigations.

### Different guidelines for imaging after first UTI in febrile infants: yield, cost, and radiation [^112v4RvZ]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the yield, economic, and radiation costs of 5 diagnostic algorithms compared with a protocol where all tests are performed (ultrasonography scan, cystography, and late technetium(99)dimercaptosuccinic acid scan) in children after the first febrile urinary tract infections.

Methods

A total of 304 children, 2 to 36 months of age, who completed the diagnostic follow-up (ultrasonography, cystourethrography, and acute and late technetium(99)dimercaptosuccinic acid scans) of a randomized controlled trial (Italian Renal Infection Study 1) were eligible. The guidelines applied to this cohort in a retrospective simulation were: Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital, National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), top down approach, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology. Primary outcomes were the yield of abnormal tests for each diagnostic protocol; secondary outcomes were the economic and radiation costs.

Results

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was identified in 66 (22%) children and a parenchymal scarring was identified in 45 (15%). For detection of VUR (47/66) and scarring (45/45), the top down approach showed the highest sensitivity (76% and 100%, respectively) but also the highest economic and radiation costs (€52268. 624 mSv). NICE (19/66) and AAP (18/66) had the highest specificities for VUR (90%) and the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology had the highest specificity (20/45) for scars (86%). NICE would have been the least costly (€26838) and AAP would have resulted in the least radiation exposure (42 mSv).

Conclusions

There is no ideal diagnostic protocol following a first febrile urinary tract infection. An aggressive protocol has a high sensitivity for detecting VUR and scarring but carries high financial and radiation costs with questionable benefit.

An additional factor often raised is the mode of practice. Physicians and surgeons graduate from the same medical schools, after which their training diverges. Physicians focus on lifestyle counselling and medication where appropriate, often involving a long-term palliative rather than a curative approach, with the ability to re-assess management as newer information becomes available. Surgeons perform definitive procedures that historically were emergency interventions, such as appendectomy, with a predominance of elective procedures only developing in recent times. Regardless, given the invasive nature and irreversibility of operations, surgeons must have a strong belief in the curative nature of their interventions to convince patients, or the parents of patients, to consent. Are the differences phenotypic with different inherent traits determining the training path undertaken, as suggested in the BMJ paper, or are they the consequence of different approaches to training, as proposed by Stirrat?

Comments such as "the literature obfuscates more than it clarifies", "these guidelines do not reflect the real world", and assertions that some guidelines (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, American Academy of Pediatrics and Italian included) "are driven by economic and health care issues", pervade the surgical literature. The admonition "You can't handle the truth!" has even been applied to the pediatric community when they debate the need for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis in children following a UTI.

The 2008 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence evidence-based guidelines on UTI in infants and young children were the first to advocate reduced imaging and intervention. Thereafter, published physician-instigated guidelines largely concurred with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, recommending additional imaging only when ultrasound was abnormal or in the few cases where recurrent febrile UTIs occurred. Otherwise, they promoted a "watchful waiting" approach, with less emphasis on VUR given the lack of evidence that intervention is of any clinical benefit, except possibly for high grade IV–V VUR, which accounts for < 5% of cases and is likely to be detected in the event of a second febrile UTI.

### Adherence to AAP practice guidelines for urinary tract infections at our teaching institution [^112PUJ7Z]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is a common diagnosis in general pediatric practice. Because of the potential severity and proven morbidity of such infections, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed guidelines to better direct clinicians in the workup. This retrospective study sought to evaluate the uniformity of adherence to these guidelines at our teaching institution. A total of 104 charts were reviewed, and data were collected based on the parameters outlined by the AAP. It is found that at the authors' teaching institution, there is at least 70% adherence to the recommendations for method of urine collection and 97% adherence to performance of urinalysis. However, imaging workup, which may be the most important follow-up of a first-time UTI, has only a 61% adherence rate.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^117L7fki]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is no evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of routine investigation of children with confirmed UTI. There is limited evidence that routine imaging to detect VUR, following first UTI in older children, has no effect on recurrence or renal scarring.

High quality primary research on the effectiveness, in terms of improved patient outcome, of testing at all stages in the investigation of confirmed UTI is urgently required.

### Urinary tract infection… [^116RPoxE]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

A urinary tract infection is an infection that affects a part of the urinary tract. Lower urinary tract infections may involve the bladder or urethra while upper urinary tract infections affect the kidney. Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include suprapubic pain, painful urination, frequency and urgency of urination despite having an empty bladder. Children In young children, the only symptom of a urinary tract infection may be a fever. Because of the lack of more obvious symptoms, when females under the age of two or uncircumcised males less than a year exhibit a fever, a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations. Infants may feed poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of jaundice. In older children, new onset urinary incontinence may occur. About 1 in 400 infants of one to three months of age with a UTI also have bacterial meningitis.

It is reasonable to obtain a urine culture in those with signs of systemic infection that may be unable to report urinary symptoms, such as when advanced dementia is present. Systemic signs of infection include a fever or increase in temperature of more than 1. 1 °C from usual, chills, and an increased white blood cell count. Diagnosis In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation. In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells, or leukocyte esterase. Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. If a urinary tract infection involves the upper tract, and the person has diabetes mellitus, is pregnant, is male, or immunocompromised, it is considered complicated.

Otherwise if a woman is healthy and premenopausal it is considered uncomplicated. In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection. Children To make the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required. Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 10⁵ CFU/mL is used for a "clean-catch" mid stream sample, 10⁴ CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10² CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations. The use of "urine bags" to collect samples is discouraged by the World Health Organization due to the high rate of contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained.

Some, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection. However, because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings. Differential diagnosis In women with cervicitis or vaginitis and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Children The evidence that preventive antibiotics decrease urinary tract infections in children is poor.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114w7X7k]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) after an initial febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants 2 to 24 months is framed by the low prevalence of high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), the absence of predictive clinical or laboratory markers, and a benefits–harms balance that favors deferring VCUG until recurrence. "Of a hypothetical cohort of 100 infants with febrile UTIs, only 1 has grade V VUR; 99 do not", and "With a practice of waiting for a second UTI to perform VCUG, only 10 of the 100 would need to undergo the procedure and the 1 with grade V VUR would be identified". Moreover, "there are no clinical or laboratory indicators that have been demonstrated to identify infants with high-grade VUR". Benefits are stated as "This avoids, for the vast majority of febrile infants with UTIs, radiation exposure (of particular concern near the ovaries in girls), expense, and discomfort", while harms are "Detection of a small number of cases of high-grade reflux and correctable abnormalities is delayed". The benefit–harm judgment is "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", supported by "Aggregate quality of evidence: B (RCTs)". Patient preference considerations note "Some parents may want to avoid VCUG even after the second UTI… It is the judgment of the committee that VCUG is indicated after the second UTI", and "Exclusions: None".

### Technical report-diagnosis and management of an initial UTI in febrile infants and young children [^112uqQgp]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are clinically challenging. This report was developed to inform the revised, evidence-based, clinical guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of initial UTIs in febrile infants and young children, 2 to 24 months of age, from the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.

Methods

The conceptual model presented in the 1999 technical report was updated after a comprehensive review of published literature. Studies with potentially new information or with evidence that reinforced the 1999 technical report were retained. Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI were performed.

Results

Review of recent literature revealed new evidence in the following areas. Certain clinical findings and new urinalysis methods can help clinicians identify febrile children at very low risk of UTI. Oral antimicrobial therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in treating UTI. Data from published, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI when vesicoureteral reflux is found through voiding cystourethrography. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract after the first UTI has poor sensitivity. Early antimicrobial treatment may decrease the risk of renal damage from UTI.

Conclusions

Recent literature agrees with most of the evidence presented in the 1999 technical report, but meta-analyses of data from recent, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI. This finding argues against voiding cystourethrography after the first UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1121mZzi]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%", and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used". For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%", a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time", and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%"; for circumcised boys at "0.2%", it "is 99%". Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI". Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)", "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive", "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially".

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) imaging approach — selective imaging and radiation exposure: Although selective imaging may miss abnormalities, there is no evidence that identifying these missed abnormalities provides sufficient clinical benefit to offset cost, discomfort, and radiation; compared with the full array of imaging tests, applying the guideline has been calculated to reduce radiation burden by 93%.

Reviews against imaging and interventions

Of the 51 reviews that support a reduction in VCUGs following a first febrile UTI, 39 are medical, four surgical, eight combined, and 45 are reference medical guidelines. The six reviews that do not, note the minimal benefit of interventions in reducing febrile UTI (including no reduction in scarring) and the opportunity to reduce cost, radiation exposure, and stress for the child and family.

The 50 reviews against continuous antibiotic prophylaxis in the event of detection of VUR (37 medical, seven surgical, six combined) variously cited National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, Cochrane, a range of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a long-term Swedish follow-up study. Of note, the low incidence of recurrent febrile UTIs and scarring even in the control untreated groups led to questioning the value of any intervention.

Those against surgical intervention (11 medical, five surgical, three combined) cited meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews showing minimal benefit or benefit no better than continuous antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116oEzoE]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in childrenand the leading cause of bacterial infections in infants, yet the population incidence for all children is still largely unknown. Urinary tract infections are typically treated with antibiotics and may lead to hospitalization, genitourinary imaging, follow-up visits, and surgical intervention. Controversy remains surrounding the optimal UTI diagnostic criteria, the need for prompt diagnosis, and the role of imaging and prophylactic antibiotic therapy.,

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial decreases in health care use and viral respiratory infection transmission from social distancing measures. These shifts offer a natural experiment to gain insight into testing, treatment, and outcomes for UTI. For a nontransmissible infection such as UTI, decreased diagnosis during the pandemic would likely be primarily associated with decreased pursuit of medical care and/or a reduction in the evaluation of fever as a result of the near disappearance of most circulating viruses. Fewer UTI diagnoses during the pandemic in the face of unchanged severe outcomes may suggest that overdiagnosis and/or overtreatment were previously occurring.

While many investigations have described changes in patterns of medical care use and trends in common childhood diagnoses during the pandemic, studies have not looked specifically at the incidence of UTI diagnoses in both ambulatory and inpatient settings across community and children's hospitals. The aims of this study were to provide estimates of population-level UTI incidence and assess changes in UTI diagnoses and measures of UTI severity, such as hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Imaging practices and implications in young infants with urinary tract infection [^113CjntW]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Management of infants aged ≤ 60 days with urinary tract infections (UTI) is challenging. We examined renal imaging in infants aged ≤ 60 days with UTI at a tertiary care children's hospital to identify the impact of standardizing renal ultrasound (RUS) interpretation.

Methods

We retrospectively studied infants aged ≤ 60 days hospitalized for UTI or fever with urine culture and renal imaging obtained and final diagnosis of UTI. RUS initially had noncriterion-based (NCB) interpretation by experienced pediatric radiologists. For this study, a single pediatric radiologist used a criterion-based (CB) hydronephrosis grading system to reinterpret films initially classified as "abnormal" on the NCB reading. We compared final renal imaging results between NCB and CB groups.

Results

Of 193 infants, 180 (93%) had inpatient RUS with 114 (63%) abnormal NCB interpretation. Of those with initially abnormal NCB interpretation, 85 OF 114 (75%) had minor and 29 OF 114 (25%) had significant abnormality by CB reinterpretation. In follow-up, the CB "minor abnormality" group showed 25% abnormal renal imaging, whereas the "significant abnormality" group showed 77% abnormal renal imaging with 54% having high-grade reflux on a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Patients with CB inpatient RUS minor abnormality showed 3% abnormal RUS at follow-up, but 13% showed high-grade reflux on VCUG.

Conclusions

Standardized RUS interpretation in young infants with UTI improved the accuracy of identification of abnormalities on follow-up renal imaging. In patients with CB minor abnormality on inpatient RUS, our results suggest limited utility of follow-up RUS; however, follow-up VCUG remained useful to identify high-grade reflux.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — Action Statement 6 (VCUG and recurrence): Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) should not be performed routinely after the first febrile UTI; VCUG is indicated if RBUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances (evidence quality B; recommendation). Further evaluation should be conducted if there is a recurrence of febrile UTI (evidence quality: X; recommendation).

Morbidity

Acute UTI encompasses the full spectrum of severity from mild dysuria in an otherwise well child to life-threatening urosepsis. While serious infections are less common, they can and do occur, particularly in neonates. Since routine immunisation for Haemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae, UTI has become a more common cause of occult and serious bacterial infection in infants.

Short-term morbidity can arise from infection within the renal system. This includes systemic features including poor oral intake and dehydration, and uncommon local complications including perinephric abscess formation. Short-term morbidity also arises from haematogenous uropathogen spread. Bactaraemic UTI has been best studied in infants, as this population is most likely to have blood cultures collected during febrile illnesses. Approximately 5% of infants < 12 months with UTI have bacteraemia identified, depending on study setting. Bacteraemia can then lead to urosepsis. Meningitis can also occur with haematogenous spread to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The risk of coexisting meningitis and UTI is 1% in the neonatal period, suggesting a low threshold to perform lumbar puncture in this age group. Beyond 1 month, the risk is smaller. Typical empirical UTI antibiotics have poor CSF penetration and inadequate duration to treat bacterial meningitis.

Long-term morbidity follows renal injury and scarring from upper tract UTI. Around 15% of children with first UTI who have follow-up scanning will have evidence of renal scarring. This scarring would be clinically important if it led to renal dysfunction, hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Historical thinking suggested these sequalae were common, leading to aggressive imaging guidelines to identify children at risk of CKD. Recent data suggest the risks are much lower. A 2011 systematic review of 1576 cases found no cases where childhood UTI was the main cause of subsequent CKD. Of a further 366 local CKD patients in the same study, 13 (3%) had a history of UTI in childhood but all had renal abnormalities evident on renal ultrasound, and recurrent UTI was possibly the cause of CKD in only one case (0.3%). Therefore, in the absence of structural renal anomalies or recurrent UTI, the risk of CKD appears minimal. Debate about the significance of post-UTI renal scarring continues.

### Antimicrobial resistance and diagnostic imaging in infants younger than 2 months old hospitalized with a first febrile urinary tract infection: a population-based comparative study [^114FYTT9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Data on urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants ≤ 2 months of age are limited. We examined clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, imaging findings and clinical outcomes in infants ≤ 2 months of age and children 2–24 months of age hospitalized with the first febrile UTI.

Methods

Children ≤ 24 months of age hospitalized with their first-diagnosed febrile UTI were prospectively studied. Renal ultrasonography, Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning and voiding cystourethrography were performed in all children.

Results

Of the 388 children analyzed (255 boys and 133 girls), 61 patients were ≤ 2 months of age, representing 15.7% of the whole population, whereas 327 patients were 2–24 months of age. Escherichia coli was the predominant bacterium, with similar antimicrobial resistance in the 2 groups, and associated E. coli bacteremia occurred in 9 patients (2.3%). Renal ultrasonography showed abnormal findings in 130 patients (33.5%), but there was no difference in the rate of abnormal findings between the groups. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was present in 130 children (33.5%), including 93 (24%) with grades III-V VUR. VUR was more prevalent in the infants ≤ 2 months of age (P = 0.007), but there was no difference in the prevalence of grades III-V VUR between the groups. The incidence of renal scarring was 28.6% (111/388), and it did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

There are similarities in clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, imaging findings and clinical outcomes after a first UTI between the young infants ≤ 2 months and children 2–24 months of age. The same guidelines for the diagnosis and management after the first febrile UTI can be applied to children who are ≤ 24 months of age.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113wtdNf]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Urinary tract infection in infants and children: an update with special regard to the changing role of reflux [^1126oyzM]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to present current theories of pathogenesis and prognosis in urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal scarring during infancy and childhood, with special regard to new insights concerning the role of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). For a long time VUR and UTI were considered the only risk factors for renal scarring in childhood. Now a wider spectrum of contributing conditions is commonly accepted, which all may pose different clinical consequences and require different imaging approaches. Particularly bilateral renal scarring causes long-term sequalae; therefore, renal involvement in UTI with potential scarring has become the clinical and imaging focus, and proper diagnosis of UTI as the key factor for further management has become even more important. The VUR still remains one issue on a list of important factors such as treatment onset and response, bacterial virulence, immunological factors, genetic disposition, anatomical variants, and lower urinary tract dysfunction. Recent advances in knowledge leading to changed patho-physiological concepts, and new imaging techniques, may consecutively impact the presently established standard imaging algorithms. New, advanced imaging techniques offer improved and accelerated comprehensive imaging of the paediatric urinary tract. At present, this is complimentary to the established gold standard techniques. Strong research efforts have to be made before suggesting significant changes of current imaging concepts; however, based on recent technical advances and new insight on the natural history of paediatric urological diseases, potential changes of established imaging algorithms need to be discussed and evaluated.

Imaging

Historically, guidelines recommended aggressive imaging follow-up to identify renal scarring and complications from UTI. It is now known that the most children at risk of complications have structural abnormalities identifiable on ultrasound or recurrent UTI. Therefore, many recent guidelines suggest less or no imaging after first uncomplicated UTI for older children and less aggressive imaging after recurrent UTI (table 3).

Table 3
Summary of imaging recommendations from selected international guidelines for young children with UTI

Ultrasound

Ultrasound is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and an appropriate first-line investigation when imaging is indicated. Ultrasound can detect anatomical abnormalities and hydronephrosis or hydroureter suggesting obstruction or VUR. American and Canadian guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children aged < 2 years with first UTI, European Association of Urology guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children with first febrile UTI, while NICE recommends ultrasound only for infants < 6 months with first UTI unless infection is atypical or not responding to treatment. The NICE approach reflects the view that routine imaging after all first UTI is not cost-effective; however, imaging in younger children and other selected cases is more likely to detect findings of clinical significance. Ultrasound cannot exclude all cases of VUR but should detect most higher grade and clinically significant cases.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan

DMSA scan is a nuclear isotope uptake scan. Reduced uptake in the kidney can reflect either acute dysfunction (pyelonephritis) or long term damage (scarring), depending on the timing of the test. It is rarely required acutely but may help guide long-term management. DMSA may be indicated if UTI is atypical, recurrent or if initial ultrasound is significantly abnormal.

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)

VCUG uses fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray) to identify the course of contrast inserted by bladder catheterisation. Bladder filling, emptying and ureteric reflux can be identified. While VCUG is the gold standard for identifying and quantifying VUR, the procedure has a radiation burden and is invasive.

Consensus for exactly who and how to image is lacking. Cost, invasiveness and radiation burden must be balanced against the likelihood of identifying an abnormality which may change management for the child. While most children with uncomplicated UTI outside infancy do not require any imaging, some children are at risk of long-term morbidity after UTI. Therefore, targeted imaging and surveillance strategies for children with selected indications remains appropriate.

### Compliance with guidelines for the medical care of first urinary tract infections in infants: a population-based study [^115W5qk4]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

No population-based studies have examined the degree to which practice parameters are followed for urinary tract infections in infants.

Objective

To describe the medical care of children in their first year of life after a first urinary tract infection.

Methods

Using Washington State Medicaid data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with a urinary tract infection during their first year of life to determine how many of these children received recommended care based on the most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recommended care included timely anatomic imaging, timely imaging for reflux, and adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis. Multivariate logistic-regression models were used to evaluate if hospitalization for first urinary tract infection, young age at time of diagnosis, gender, race, primary language of parents, having a managed care plan, and rural location of household residence were associated with recommended care.

Results

Less than half of all children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection in their first year of life received the recommended medical care. Children who were hospitalized for their first urinary tract infection were significantly more likely than children who were not hospitalized to receive anatomic imaging (relative risk [RR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20–1.57) and imaging for reflux (RR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.34–1.90).

Conclusions

There is poor compliance with guideline-recommended care for first urinary tract infections in infants in a Medicaid population. Given the trend toward increased outpatient management of urinary tract infections, increased attention to outpatient imaging may be warranted.

### Adherence to urologic imaging guidelines after febrile urinary tract infection in infants [^112UYvn6]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely imaging is recommended after febrile UTI (fUTI) in young children to identify treatable urologic conditions. The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline recommends renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) after fUTI and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) after abnormal RBUS or second fUTI.

Objective

We sought to investigate practice pattern variability and associated factors in pediatric fUTI imaging in primary care clinics.

Study Design

All children < 24 months old with fUTI (temperature ≥ 38C, positive urinalysis, and > 50,000 CFU on urine culture) in a large primary care network in a US Northeast state in 2019 were reviewed. Those with congenital genitourinary anomalies were excluded. We fitted a multivariable logistic regression model with a primary outcome of adherence to the AAP guideline.

Results

In total we included118 patients with fUTI. Overall, post-UTI imaging was adherent to the AAP guideline in 82 cases (69.5%, See Figure). Reasons for non-adherence were: no RBUS (N = 21), VCUG despite normal RBUS (N = 9), no VCUG after abnormal RBUS (N = 4), and no VCUG after a second fUTI (N = 2). In the multivariable logistic regression model, significant predictors of guideline adherence were commercial insurance (OR = 2.82, p = 0.047), more providers in the practice (OR = 1.38, p = 0.05), and younger provider age (OR = 0.96, p = 0.043) after adjusting for patient's age, sex, maximal temperature during fUTI.

Discussion

Young children with fUTI received guideline-adherent imaging from their primary care clinician approximately 70% of the time in this sample, though significant opportunities for improvement exist. Guideline adherence was more likely for commercially-insured patients, providers working in larger offices, and younger providers, suggesting both patient and provider characteristics impact the practice pattern.

Conclusion

We observed a wide variation of imaging ordering practice for fUTI in primary care clinic network. Further research may seek to examine reasons for non-adherence, thereby guiding efforts to improve it.

### Diagnosis and imaging in urinary tract infections [^1162U2kx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in urinary tract infection is to detect conditions that must be treated in order to avoid immediate deterioration or recurrences, and probable long-term kidney damage. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies.

### Different guidelines for imaging after first UTI in febrile infants: yield, cost, and radiation… [^114itVBb]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the yield, economic, and radiation costs of 5 diagnostic algorithms compared with a protocol where all tests are performed in children after the first febrile urinary tract infections. A total of 304 children, 2 to 36 months of age, who completed the diagnostic follow-up of a randomized controlled trial were eligible. The guidelines applied to this cohort in a retrospective simulation were: Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital, National Institute of Clinical Excellence, top down approach, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology. Primary outcomes were the yield of abnormal tests for each diagnostic protocol; secondary outcomes were the economic and radiation costs.

Vesicoureteral reflux was identified in 66 children and a parenchymal scarring was identified in 45. For detection of VUR and scarring, the top down approach showed the highest sensitivity but also the highest economic and radiation costs. NICE and AAP had the highest specificities for VUR and the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology had the highest specificity for scars. NICE would have been the least costly and AAP would have resulted in the least radiation exposure. There is no ideal diagnostic protocol following a first febrile urinary tract infection. An aggressive protocol has a high sensitivity for detecting VUR and scarring but carries high financial and radiation costs with questionable benefit.

Comments Guidelines for Imaging after First Febrile UTI
- Recalculation and Future Direction The authors of this manuscript are to be congratulated for comparing the different current competing algorithms for evaluation of infants with their first febrile UTI. The goals of imaging evaluation of infants with febrile UTIs are to identify those at risk for renal scarring and those at risk for recurrent febrile UTIs. In their study the top down approach had the highest sensitivity for detection of VUR and renal scarring. The sensitivity for detection of clinically significant grades III -V VUR was even higher. The biggest downside to this approach was the increased per patient cost and radiation exposure, as reported in the article. However, the authors included a 2nd late follow-up DMSA scan in their calculations and this is not a recommended requirement of the top down approach.

Yes, this late DMSA improves the specificity for detection of scarring, but since acquired post-pyelonephritic scars are always preceded by acute inflammatory changes in the same location on acute scans, then the sensitivity for detection of renal scarring with top down approach remains 100% even without the follow-up study. Again, the goal of imaging is to identify those "at risk" for renal scarring and recurrent febrile UTIs and therefore those who need further evaluation with a VCUG. By eliminating the unnecessary follow-up DMSA scan from this algorithm, the costs and radiation exposure would have been significantly reduced. Furthermore, studies of children with VUR on antibiotic prophylaxis have shown that an abnormal acute DMSA scan has the additional advantage of being highly predictive of those at risk for a recurrent breakthrough febrile UTI.

### Can diagnostic and imaging recommendations from the 2011 AAP UTI guidelines be applied to infants [^113BKhUR]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of children 2-to-24-months-old with initial febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI). Available data were insufficient to determine whether evidence from studies of 2-to-24-month-olds applies to those < 2-months-old, so they were excluded.

Objective

This study aimed to 1) compare demographic, clinical, imaging and outcomes between patients < 2-months-old and those 2-to-24-months-old hospitalized with fUTI, and 2) assess whether diagnostic and imaging recommendations of the AAP 2011 guidelines apply to those < 2-months-old.

Study Design

A cohort study of patients ≤ 24-months-old hospitalized at a children's hospital with fUTI from 2016 to 2018 was conducted. Data were collected via a prospectively generated electronic medical record note template, supplemented with retrospective chart review. Primary outcomes included differences in demographics, clinical presentation, urine culture results, and imaging utilization/results by age group. Secondary outcomes included surgical procedures, UTI recurrence, and 90-day all-cause readmissions and emergency department (ED) revisits. Univariate and bivariate statistics were utilized to compare age groups.

Results

Overall, 137 patients were included (median age 70 days, 55.5% male [92.1% uncircumcised], 53.3% Hispanic/Latino, 89.8% 1st fUTI). There were no demographic differences between groups, except children < 2-months-old were more frequently male (71.2 vs 43.6%, p = 0.002). The Summary Table compares clinical factors and imaging utilization by age. There were no differences in urinalysis or urine culture results between groups. Patients < 2-months-old had shorter fever duration, lower maximum temperature, and lower white blood cell counts. Voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs) were recommended and obtained more frequently in patients < 2-months-old, but there were no differences in renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) or VCUG results between age groups. There were no differences in UTI recurrence (13.6% of < 2-months-old vs 14.1% of 2-to-24-months-old, p = 1.00) or fUTI recurrence (13.6 vs 7.7%, p = 0.40) within 1 year, 90-day readmission (6.8 vs 6.4%, p = 1.00), or 90-day ED revisit (22.0 vs 20.5%, p = 1.00).

Discussion

There were minimal differences between the < 2-months-old and 2-to-24-months-old age groups in demographics, laboratory (including microbial) or imaging results, or clinical outcomes. Patients < 2-months-old were more frequently male and less ill. These data support applying urinalysis and urine culture diagnostic criteria, and universal RBUS, from the AAP guidelines to patients < 2-months-old. Given utilization differences, applicability of VCUG guideline recommendations requires further clarification for patients < 2-months-old.

Conclusion

Laboratory testing and RBUS recommendations from the AAP guidelines may be safely applied to infants < 2-months-old. Further studies are needed to clarify optimal VCUG recommendations.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^113YNbiD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^111iW2Rd]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We assembled a database of published and unpublished literature from systematic searches of 16 electronic databases (inception to between October 2002 and February 2003), hand searching of 12 journals, consultation with experts in the field, and screening bibliographies of included studies. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. There were no language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

We included controlled trials that compared different imaging strategies and reported patient based outcomes. We also included diagnostic cohort studies that included at least 20 children, some of whom were aged five years or under, and that reported sufficient information to construct 2 × 2 tables. Table 1 presents a summary of the tests evaluated in this review and details the potential advantages that these tests have over the current reference standards. Although other tests have been evaluated, this article will focus on those offering potential advantages over the current reference standard. Studies had to compare one of the index tests listed in this table to the listed reference standard, for each of the different aims.

### Early effect of American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guidelines on radiographic imaging and diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in the emergency room setting [^114j7Lkr]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

In 2011 the AAP revised practice parameters on febrile urinary tract infection in infants and children 2 to 24 months old. New imaging recommendations invigorated the ongoing debate regarding the diagnosis and management of vesicoureteral reflux. We compared evaluations in these patients with febrile urinary tract infection before and after guideline publication.

Materials and Methods

During 2 separate 6-month periods 350 patients 2 to 24 months old were evaluated in the emergency room setting. Demographics, urine culture, renal-bladder ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram and admission status were assessed.

Results

A total of 172 patients presented with initial febrile urinary tract infection in 2011, of whom 47 (27.3%) required hospitalization, while 42 of 178 (23.6%) were admitted in 2012. Admission by year did not significantly differ (p = 0.423). After guideline revision 41.2% fewer voiding cystourethrograms were done (72.1% of cases in 2011 vs 30.9% in 2012, p < 0.001). A 17.2% decrease in renal-bladder ultrasound was noted (75.6% in 2011 vs 58.4% in 2012, p < 0.001). Of 55 voiding cystourethrograms 21 (38.2%) were positive in 2012 compared to 36.3% in 2011 (p = 0.809). Mean ± SD maximum vesicoureteral reflux grade was unchanged in 2011 and 2012 (2.9 ± 1.2 and 2.5 ± 0.93, respectively, p = 0.109). There was no association between abnormal renal-bladder ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram positivity (p = 0.116).

Conclusions

AAP guidelines impacted the treatment of infants and young children with febrile urinary tract infection. We found no relationship between renal-bladder ultrasound and abnormal voiding cystourethrogram, consistent with previous findings that call ultrasound into question as the determinant for additional imaging. Whether forgoing routine voiding cystourethrogram results in increased morbidity is the subject of ongoing study.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^115WNT2u]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Urinary tract infection in childhood [^117CSEPn]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past year, research about urinary tract infections in childhood has yielded new data about methods to detect, treat, and evaluate children who develop urinary tract infection. New imaging modalities have been studied. Long term studies following children with urinary tract infection have also been published over the last year. However, major questions remain to be answered, including the underlying basis of host-pathogen interactions in the urinary tract, as well as the most effective methods for clinical diagnosis and management.

### Risk factors for imaging abnormalities after the first febrile urinary tract infection in infants ≤ 3 months old: a retrospective cohort study [^1176PAGk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of infants ≤ 3 months old with first febrile UTI admitted from May 2010 to April 2016 into KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), an 800-bed tertiary institution in Singapore.

All infants ≤ 3 months old admitted for their first febrile UTI were included in this study. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of ≥ 38°C. UTI was confirmed by positive urine culture(s): one urine specimen via transurethral catheterisation with bacteria growth of ≥ 10 000 cfu/mL or two clean catch midstream urine specimens both with the same bacteria with growth of ≥ 100 000 cfu/mL. Data collected during the hospital admission and at subsequent follow-up visits include baseline characteristics, antenatal and birth history, clinical course and investigation (blood, urine and imaging) results.

At KKH Children's Emergency, patients who are < 6 months old with suspected febrile UTI are admitted for further management. Patients were all initially treated with intravenous gentamicin. Patients < 1 month old received additional intravenous ampicillin to cover empirically for gram-positive bacteria. Gentamicin was converted to ceftriaxone if the serum creatinine (SCr) at admission was elevated. The antibiotics were subsequently adjusted based on urine culture sensitivity results. The total treatment course of antibiotics, both intravenous and oral, was 14 days. If there was bacteraemia, intravenous antibiotics were continued for a minimum 7 days. In general, US KUB was performed 4–6 weeks after a febrile UTI and DMSA scan was performed 4–6 months after a febrile UTI (figure 1). MCU was indicated if the febrile UTI was atypical or complicated (eg, a history of urinary tract abnormality, bacteraemia, sepsis, poor urine output, raised SCr, palpable abdominal mass/bladder or persistent fever after 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment), if there was recurrence of UTI and/or if US KUB or DMSA scans were abnormal. During the study period, antibiotic prophylaxis was given after the treatment of the first febrile UTI for infants < 1 year old and stopped after a normal US KUB and DMSA scan.

### Different imaging strategies in febrile urinary tract infection in childhood. what, when, why? [^116JmvtG]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

Magnetic Resonance Urography

Magnetic resonance urography is a radiation-sparing imaging technique that provides both anatomic detail and functional information and should be considered in children with known and complex urological conditions.

Referral

When there is an ongoing risk of renal damage that is unlikely to improve without surgical intervention, referral to a pediatric nephro/urology team is important. This is most common for children with significant urological abnormalities, including high-grade VUR (GRADE D).

Children with significant urological abnormalities, including but not limited to ureteric obstruction, duplex kidneys with VUR, grades 3–5 VUR, grades 3–4 hydronephrosis and neurogenic bladder, should be discussed acutely with and referred promptly to a pediatric nephro/urology team. High-grade VUR may persist without intervention. Evaluation of bladder function through urodynamics performed by urologists should be considered with recurrent UTI or with anatomical or functional abnormalities, as the investigation may detect abnormalities such as manageable detrusor overactivity or dysfunctional voiding.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115B16df]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — Action Statement 5 (ultrasound evaluation): Febrile infants with UTIs should undergo renal and bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) (evidence quality: C; recommendation), and ideally, the patient should be well-hydrated for the examination and the bladder should be evaluated while distended. Concern has been raised that RBUS is not effective to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), as it is frequently normal in infants with low-grade VUR and even in some who have high-grade VUR; although RBUS is not invariably abnormal in infants with grades IV and V VUR, it does identify most, and an abnormal RBUS is a major risk factor for scarring.

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^114435LA]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

Studies evaluating imaging and interventions

With the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines restricting ultrasound to infants less than 6 months of age, and both the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommending VCUG following an uncomplicated first febrile UTI, 39 studies applied the newer guidelines to a retrospective fully investigated cohort to determine what would have been missed, at least until a second febrile UTI. As expected, all studies determined that omitting a VCUG would have resulted in fewer cases of VUR being detected. This was deemed acceptable in 20 studies (13 medical, five surgical, two combined), with the newer guidelines, relying on US, considered able to detect most significant abnormalities including grade IV–V VUR, while often missing lesser grade II–III VUR with absent or mild dilatation, that would be found in the event of recurrent UTI, with savings in terms of reduced imaging costs and radiation exposure. In contrast, performance of a VCUG was deemed necessary in 19 studies (11 surgical, six medical, two combined) with concern expressed that the abnormalities missed, in particular VUR of any grade, would place children at an indeterminate but possibly significant risk of morbidity.

Other studies by pediatricians were six in total and included two papers on compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and revised American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, two RCTs, a meta-analysis of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of scarring, and a study of scarring and cancer risk following VCUG. Other publications by surgeons were four in total and included a retrospective assessment of UTI post-surgery, citing a febrile UTI incidence of 6.5% whereas the only prospective RCT where children were maintained on continuous antibiotic prophylaxis post-surgery had a febrile UTI incidence of 21%, a study of surgical technique with recommendations on investigation and management, and a lower urinary tract dysfunction study.

Of the 58 studies that reported on surgical technique for correction of VUR, all but one were excluded from this review, as no recommendations were made regarding investigation or management. The excluded papers are listed in Supplementary Material 2. Furthermore, only ten papers gave indications for surgery including breakthrough UTI despite antibiotic prophylaxis, deteriorating kidney function, and parental preference, while 44 were without indications for performing surgery. The 57 excluded papers represented the largest group of studies with an implicit assumption that VUR is a disease to be cured.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^116N7Zy1]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common condition in children, and pathways of management have evolved over time.

Objective

To determine the extent to which pediatricians and surgeons differ in their investigation and management of a first febrile UTI, and to evaluate the justifications for any divergence of approach.

Materials and methods

A literature search was conducted for papers addressing investigation and/or management following a first febrile UTI in children published between 2011 and 2021. Searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. To be eligible for inclusion, a paper was required to provide recommendations on one or more of the following: ultrasound (US) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), the need for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and surgery when vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected. The authorship required at least one pediatrician or surgeon. Authorship was categorized as medical, surgical, or combined.

Results

Pediatricians advocated less imaging and intervention and were more inclined to adopt a "watchful-waiting" approach, confident that any significant abnormality, grades IV–V VUR in particular, should be detected following a second febrile UTI. In contrast, surgeons were more likely to recommend imaging to detect VUR (p < 0.00001), and antibiotic prophylaxis (p < 0.001) and/or surgical correction (p = 0.004) if it was detected, concerned that any delay in diagnosis and treatment could place the child at risk of kidney damage. Papers with combined authorship displayed intermediate results.

Conclusion

There are two distinct directions in the literature regarding the investigation of an uncomplicated first febrile UTI in a child. In general, when presented with a first febrile UTI in a child, physicians recommend fewer investigations and less treatment, in contrast to surgeons who advocate extensive investigation and aggressive intervention in the event that imaging detects an abnormality. This has the potential to confuse the carers of affected children.

### Risk factors for imaging abnormalities after the first febrile urinary tract infection in infants ≤ 3 months old: a retrospective cohort study [^1124rX8k]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Objectives

To assess the association of clinical factors and investigation results (blood and urine) with imaging abnormalities (ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters and bladder; dimercaptosuccinic acid scan; and/or micturating cystourethrogram) and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants ≤ 3 months old presenting with their first febrile UTI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants ≤ 3 months old with first febrile UTI admitted from 2010 to 2016. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyse the association of imaging abnormalities and recurrent UTI with covariates selected a priori: age at presentation, maximum temperature, duration of illness at presentation, interval between start of antibiotics and fever resolution, C-reactive protein, total white cell count on the full blood count, bacteraemia, white cell count on the urinalysis and non- Escherichia coli growth in the urine culture (non- E. coli UTI).

Results

There were 190 infants but 12 did not undergo any imaging. Median age at presentation was 63 days (IQR 41–78). Twenty-four patients had imaging abnormalities. Non- E. coli UTI (adjusted OR (aOR) 5.01, 95% CI 1.65 to 15.24, p = 0.004) was independently associated with imaging abnormalities, while bacteraemia (aOR 4.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 19.43, p = 0.022) and non- E. coli UTI (aOR 5.06, 95% CI 1.90 to 13.48, p = 0.001) were independently associated with recurrent UTI.

Conclusion

Non- E. coli UTI at the first febrile UTI in infants ≤ 3 months old may be useful in predicting imaging abnormalities while bacteraemia and non- E. coli UTI may be useful to predict recurrent UTI.

Problem

Although clear guidelines exist to guide the choice of imaging performed for children with urinary tract infection (UTI) there is very poor compliance in clinical practice. At The Royal Oldham Hospital (part of The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, UK) we identified this problem initially due to the number of inappropriate imaging requests, and the lack of requests for indicated imaging that appeared to be a recurring theme when completing discharge summaries. Informal assessment of knowledge of the guidance at clinical handover sessions revealed that most were aware that guidance existed, however the majority of clinicians either missed imaging or selected inappropriate imaging in response to multiple choice questions for a given scenario.

### National imaging and antibiotic practice patterns in children presenting with urinary tract infection to community practices: little impact from the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines? [^116kTQci]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Our objective was to use community-based, national databases to evaluate diagnostic imaging and antibiotic prophylaxis practice patterns before and after the release of the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for acute febrile urinary tract infection. Using the National Ambulatory and Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, urinary tract infection encounters were identified for patients aged 2 months to 18 years. Primary outcomes were utilization of antibiotics (as proxy for prophylaxis) and diagnostic imaging during encounters. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between time period (before and after 2011) and each of the primary outcomes. Among 8 588 035 weighted encounters, adjusting for covariates, there was insufficient evidence to suggest a difference between time periods for antibiotic utilization (odds ratio = 0.66, P = 0.12) or diagnostic imaging (odds ratio = 1.16, P = 0.56). Thus, we did not find evidence of changes in antibiotic utilization or diagnostic imaging practice patterns after the release of the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.

### Febrile urinary tract infections: clinical and laboratory diagnosis, imaging, and prognosis [^116DSnoD]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

According to the literature, febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common severe bacterial infections occurring in childhood, with potential serious long-term consequences. In recent years, there have been significant developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical and laboratory issues of febrile UTIs. Studies are focusing on the role of predisposing host factors related to genes regulating immune response, inflammation and fibrosis in the development of acute renal damage and subsequent processes leading to renal scars. All the available guidelines underline the importance of a correct diagnosis of febrile UTI to allow a more rational use of antibiotics and imaging. As a consequence, a shift from aggressive imaging studies to a more restrictive and targeted approach has been recently observed. Regarding the prognosis of febrile UTI, the introduction of prenatal ultrasound studies revealed that a great portion of the alterations at imaging (and thus of the clinical complications), previously attributed to postinfection scarring, were because of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. Although the long-term consequences of febrile UTIs are difficult to ascertain, it seems that children with febrile UTI, normal renal function and normal kidneys at start present a very low risk of developing decreased renal function or hypertension during follow-up. However, high body temperature and high procalcitonin levels during the acute phase of disease, which are indicative of severe inflammation, and the finding of renal scarring on imaging with DMSA scintigraphy 6 months after febrile UTI, together with the detection of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities, indicate "kidney at risk" in UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: an update on imaging strategies [^113jKJKT]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children. The distinction between upper and lower tract UTI is clinically difficult but important, as permanent renal damage can occur when the UTI involves the kidneys. Children with a history of UTI need investigated promptly and thoroughly. The goal of imaging in UTI is to aid in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, to identify those children who are at high risk of developing permanent renal damage, and to confirm and monitor the presence of renal scarring. This article reviews the role of radiology in each of these aims.

Urinary tract infection in the pediatric population can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly and appropriately. All first infections may signify possible underlying anatomic or functional abnormality and require imaging of the lower and upper tracts. Accurate diagnosis of UTIs requires a properly collected quantitative urine culture. Treatment should be tailored to the pathogen as dictated by the urine culture sensitivities to minimize the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Prophylactic agents should differ from the antibiotic used in the acute setting and preferably concentrated in the urinary tract, with minimal effects on the normal fecal flora. In the long term, patients with documented evidence of renal scarring should be followed up for signs of renal deterioration and hypertension.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Risk factors for imaging abnormalities after the first febrile urinary tract infection in infants ≤ 3 months old: a retrospective cohort study [^114VZSe3]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common among infants ≤ 3 months old, with a prevalence of 7.2%. The known risk factors of UTI in this group of young infants include the presence of congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (eg, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)), uncircumcised infant boysand incomplete or intermittent bladder emptying due to the infants' physiologic detrusor sphincter dyscoordination which usually improves with time.

There are differences between guidelines regarding imaging after the first febrile UTI. The indications of ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (US KUB) are heterogeneous with some advocating for this to be a routine non-invasive testwhile others have advised for this to be done for at-risk age groups or based on clinical indications. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) are generally not routine unless clinically indicated — common indications include recurrent UTI or urinary tract dilatation on US KUB. Importantly, recommendations for some of the UTI guidelines do not apply to infants ≤ 2 months.

UTIs can recur in up to 19% of children, even in the absence of urinary tract obstruction or VUR. Risk factors for recurrent UTIs include first UTI occurring at < 6 months of age. The most concerning complication of recurrent UTIs is the increased risk of kidney scarring with each episode of UTI recurrence. With significant kidney scarring, there is a risk of developing hypertension, proteinuriaand gradual loss of kidney function.

With increasing awareness of the effects of recurrent UTIs on children, it would be important to identify risk factors for abnormal kidney imaging (US KUB, DMSA scan and/or MCU) and recurrent UTIs in very young infants who present with their first febrile UTI. To date, studies on paediatric UTIs have investigated association between a wide variety of risk factors in children or infants of varying ages with many different outcomes, such as kidney scarring, VUR and UTI recurrence. We hypothesised that there is a set of risk factors in infants ≤ 3 months old who present with first febrile UTI which is associated with abnormal kidney imaging (US KUB, DMSA scan and/or MCU) and/or recurrent UTI. This is a pilot study from which results will be used to develop a prediction model or risk scoring system in a subsequent study with a larger group of patients.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^11797t3a]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, imaging and conservative management of urinary tract infections based on the peer-reviewed literature of the last year.

Recent Findings

It has been estimated that 3% of prepubertal girls and 1% of prepubertal boys are diagnosed with urinary tract infections. Breastfeeding has been shown to offer significant protection against urinary tract infection in infants. Any young child with an acute pyelonephritis should be evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to confirm or rule out renal scarring. The voiding cystourethrogram can be performed within the first 7 days of diagnosis. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporin are the first-line antibiotics to treat children with uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

Summary

The incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy and childhood is high and influenced by the age and sex of the patient. Voiding cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan are required for imaging. Short-course treatment is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.

### Imaging studies in young children following UTI… [^112UoNd1]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend renal ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography in all children two months to two years of age with a documented first urinary tract infection. Other authorities have suggested using renal scanning with technetium 99m at the acute infection and later to detect evidence of renal scarring. Hoberman and colleagues conducted a prospective trial to determine if imaging studies in young children with a first UTI altered management or improved outcomes. This multicenter trial initially enrolled 421 children who were one to 24 months of age and had a fever and pyuria or bacteriuria in a catheterized urine specimen. Final study results were calculated for 309 children, after excluding those with negative urine cultures, declined consent, or other logistical barriers to participation.

Each child received renal ultrasonography and technetium 99m renal scanning within 48 hours of the initial diagnosis of UTI. VCUG was performed in 98 percent of the subjects one month after the infection, and follow-up renal scanning was performed in 89 percent of the subjects six months after diagnosis to detect any renal scarring. Children with at least grade II vesicoureteral reflux received either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin once daily for 11 months or until the reflux was classified as grade I or less. The initial renal sonogram was normal in 88 percent of the children with UTI. The presence of hydroureter on ultrasonography was not a sensitive screen for urine reflux, identifying only 10 percent of children who had reflux that was later confirmed by VCUG. No child had a change in clinical management based on renal sonography. Nuclear medicine renal scanning identified acute pyelonephritis in 61 percent of children with UTI.

At six months of follow-up, repeat renal scanning identified scarring in 9. 5 percent of children. Scarring was more likely in the subgroups of patients with initial evidence of vesicoureteral reflux than in those without vesicoureteral reflux. No child with an initially normal renal scan had scarring on the six-month follow-up scan. VCUG demonstrated reflux of urine in 39 percent of children. Only 4 percent of children had reflux above grade III. The authors conclude that results of initial renal sonography and nuclear medicine scanning are not likely to alter management in young children with UTI. The authors advocate obtaining a urinalysis and urine culture to identify any recurrence of infection in subsequent febrile episodes in a child with a documented UTI.

### Investigating febrile UTI in infants: is a cystogram necessary? [^114uoYGd]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Current imaging recommendations for investigating any infantile febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) are ultrasound scan (US), micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine the need and indications for MCUG in the investigation of a first febrile infantile UTI, as doubts have been raised over its benefit.

Patients and Methods

Information on 427 infants who had undergone US, MCUG and DMSA following a first febrile UTI was prospectively recorded. The infants were divided into two groups: A (354) with normal renal US and B (73) with abnormal US. DMSA findings were correlated with findings on MCUG. Main outcome measures were incidence of recurrent UTIs, change in management or intervention as a result of MCUG, and outcome at discharge.

Results

Only 21/354 (6%) infants in Group A had both scarring on DMSA and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), predominantly low-grade on MCUG. In Group B (abnormal US), 23/73 (32%) had scarring on DMSA and vesicoureteric reflux, predominantly high grade on MCUG. Of the infants with non-scarred kidneys, 73% had dilating reflux. Successful conservative treatment was performed in 423 infants, and 4 infants in Group B required surgery.

Conclusion

We recommend US and DMSA in all infantile febrile UTI cases. Where US is normal, MCUG should be reserved for those cases with abnormal DMSA. Where US is abnormal, MCUG should be performed irrespective of findings on DMSA scan. A randomized prospective study is necessary to evaluate this further.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1174SWeg]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

RBUS after initial febrile UTI — timing and evidence profile: RBUS is recommended during the first 2 days of treatment to identify serious complications when the clinical illness is unusually severe or substantial clinical improvement is not occurring; for febrile infants with UTIs who demonstrate substantial clinical improvement, imaging does not need to occur early during the acute infection. Findings on nuclear scans are not recommended as part of routine evaluation of infants with their first febrile UTI, and the radiation dose during dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning is generally low (~1 mSv). Aggregate quality of evidence is C (observational studies). Benefits state that RBUS in this population will yield abnormal results in ~15% of cases, and 1% to 2% will have abnormalities that would lead to action. Harms/risks/costs note that between 2% and 3% will be false-positive results. The benefit-harms assessment is "Preponderance of benefit over harm", and value judgments emphasize that "The seriousness of the potentially correctable abnormalities in 1% to 2%, coupled with the absence of physical harm, was judged sufficiently important to tip the scales in favor of testing". Policy level is "Recommendation".

### Imaging recommendations in paediatric uroradiology: minutes of the ESPR workgroup session on urinary tract infection, fetal hydronephrosis, urinary tract ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography, barcelona, Spain, June 2007 [^115HwJ2z]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

We present here a few basic proposals for algorithms and procedures for imaging the paediatric genitourinary tract based on initial discussion at a paediatric uroradiology symposium and proposals of the ESUR Paediatric Uroradiologic Guidelines Subcommittee. These recommendations were developed in the light of new knowledge that might influence existing guidelines. Regional, individual and local flexibility and variability should be preserved in order to make these recommendations applicable throughout Europe. They should help standardize dedicated imaging not only in terms of a quality measure to ensure state-of-the-art patient care, but also in forming a common basis for multi-institutional research. There is an urgent need for these guidelines in order to advance our understanding of the subject and to gain evidence and improve imaging efficacy. Our session worked towards establishing an agreement on imaging indications in common paediatric urological conditions, respecting the ALARA principle, and patient safety and care, and taking into account state of the art knowledge and efficacy aspects. We started the task with a reassessment of (1) imaging in urinary tract infection in infants and children, (2) postnatal imaging in mild-to-moderate neonatal hydronephrosis, (3) how to perform voiding cystourethrography, and (4) procedural recommendations for paediatric urosonography. This list is incomplete, and future recommendations will be developed, discussed and presented at forthcoming meetings.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114u2fnH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — states that diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50 000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. This Clinical Practice Guideline was retired May 2021.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114fcMVu]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Action statement 7 — After confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI), the clinician should instruct parents or guardians to seek prompt medical evaluation (ideally within 48 hours) for future febrile illnesses, to ensure that recurrent infections can be detected and treated promptly (evidence quality: C; recommendation). Early treatment limits renal damage better than late treatment, and the risk of renal scarring increases as the number of recurrences increases; all infants who have sustained a febrile UTI should have a urine specimen obtained at the onset of subsequent febrile illnesses, so that a UTI can be diagnosed and treated promptly. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes, and ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation. Routine VCUG after the first UTI is not recommended; VCUG is indicated if RBUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG also should be performed if there is a recurrence of febrile UTI.

### New developments in the diagnosis and management of pediatric UTIs [^1178nc4n]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are common and a major source of morbidity. The incidence of UTIs in childhood is not precisely known because it is not a reportable disease, and in many cases, especially in infants, UTIs are underdiagnosed. Furthermore, the definitions and criteria for diagnosis vary considerably. This article reviews the diagnosis and work-up of UTIs in children, and presents current data reviewing the roles of radiologic imaging, surgical correction, and antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of pediatric UTIs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116SCarT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infection: evolving practices and current controversies in pediatric imaging [^113WHsFA]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) undergo imaging tests to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the belief that VUR correlates to risk of renal scarring. This article describes recent evolution and controversies in the management of UTI and VUR.

Conclusion

Multitechnique imaging of UTI and VUR is complex and controversial. Evolution in practice patterns is motivated by the desire to rationally minimize unnecessary interventions and radiation exposure. Ongoing evidence-based research is needed to further improve practice guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116YpF2W]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — relationships of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), imaging, and scarring highlight that the role of VUR (and therefore of VCUG) is incompletely understood. Pyelonephritis (defined through cortical scintigraphy) can occur without VUR (defined through VCUG), and progressive renal scarring (defined through cortical scintigraphy) can occur without demonstrated VUR. The presumption that antimicrobial prophylaxis benefits individuals with VUR to prevent recurrences of UTI or development of renal scars is not supported by the aggregate of recent studies and is being examined in the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux study.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^117EeSio]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Urinary tract infections in young children and infants: common questions and answers [^115NM8v3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. They have a high recurrence rate and are associated with anatomic and functional abnormalities. The decision to test for UTI is based on risk factors and the child's age. Urinalysis is valuable to rule out UTI and to help decide when to start antibiotics; however, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Urine specimens collected via perineal bagging should not be used for culture because of high false-positive rates. Diagnosis of UTI requires pyuria and bacterial growth in the urine culture. Prompt treatment of UTIs reduces renal scarring. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. In most cases, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous agents. When intravenous antibiotics are used, early transition to an oral regimen is as effective as longer intravenous courses. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful to identify acute complications and anatomic abnormalities. Voiding cystourethrography is indicated when ultrasound findings are abnormal and in cases of recurrent febrile UTIs. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs is controversial. Identification and treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunction can prevent UTI recurrence.

### Improving the care of children with urinary tract infection: use of a clinical decision proforma [^112n91VA]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Design

It seemed clear that to meet the accepted standards a tool would be required to support the decision making process. To identify the optimal imaging strategy the clinician must assess the patient against 7 criteria for atypical UTI, 3 criteria for recurrent UTI, and then choose from a combination of 4 different investigations. For example; an atypical UTI in a child aged < 6 months should result in an ultrasound scan during the acute infection, a dimercaptosuccinic acid scan 4–6 months later, and an micturating cystourethrogram; whereas an atypical UTI in a child aged > 3 years only requires an ultrasound scan during the acute infection. To support this decision making process we devised a proforma which guided the clinician firstly in correctly classifying the UTI as typical, atypical, or recurrent, and secondly in selecting the correct imaging strategy for each classification in each age range. The simple flow chart design of the proforma was designed to make the decision making process clear and simple.

However well the proforma was designed it would not impact practice if not used. To support the intervention we presented the finding of the baseline audit to the department and used this as a rationale for adopting the proforma. The importance of appropriate imaging in UTIs was included in the clinical induction programme with emphasis on using the proforma to support decision making.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^111Z7V9H]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaUrinary tract Infection-child [^116UVaz1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in young children and may cause pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Long-term complications from renal scarring are low. The role of imaging is to evaluate for underlying urologic abnormalities and guide treatment. In neonates there is increased risk for underlying urologic abnormalities. Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may be appropriate especially in boys because of higher prevalence of VUR and to exclude posterior urethral valve. In children older than 2 months with first episode of uncomplicated UTI, there is no clear benefit of prophylactic antibiotic. Ultrasound is the only study that is usually appropriate. After the age of 6 years, UTIs are infrequent. There is no need for routine imaging as VUR is less common. In children with recurrent or complicated UTI, in addition to ultrasound, imaging of VUR is usually appropriate. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be appropriate in children with VUR, as renal scarring may support surgical intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^113Dxvp2]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The literature search performed during the 11-year period from 2011, when the revised American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on the investigation and management of a first febrile UTI in infancy were published, largely concurring with the earlier National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, demonstrated significant differences in approach between physicians and surgeons in terms of imaging, antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgery in the event of VUR detection. It should be clarified that this is not a systematic review or meta-analysis, which represent scholarly syntheses of evidence on a subject to inform healthcare decisions. While physicians have largely embraced evidence-based medicine, surgeons in many cases have not; thus, any systematic review or meta-analysis would potentially exclude large portions of the surgical literature and thus make any assessment of conflicting views between the two groups impossible.

An analysis of the papers identifies some indication of the justifications given by physicians and surgeons for the divergence of opinion. Physicians as a group, in line with the newer evidence-based guidelines, advocate less imaging and intervention, and are inclined to adopt a "watchful-waiting" approach, confident that any significant abnormality, grade IV–V VUR in particular, should be picked up following a second febrile UTI. In contrast, surgeons as a group are more likely to recommend imaging to detect VUR, with antibiotic prophylaxis and/or surgical correction if it is detected, concerned that any delay in diagnosis and treatment could place the child at risk of kidney damage. This divergence of approach between physicians and surgeons often confuses the family of the child, regarding the choice of how to best proceed with the diagnostic and therapeutic process.

### Diffusion tensor imaging based multiparametric characterization of renal lesions in infants with urinary tract infections: an explorative study [^116mMYJz]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in infants with an incidence of 2% in children under 1 year of age. Ultrasound is often used as a first line investigation of infants with UTI. The use of further imaging varies depending on which protocol that is used. When further imaging is needed, for example to evaluate the extent of engagement of the renal tissue or to identify complications of the infection, dependent on availability, 99mTc-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) or contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used. However, DMSA scintigraphy and contrast-enhanced techniques are invasive as they require an intravenous injection. DMSA scintigraphy and CT also has the drawback of using ionizing radiation. Therefore, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), a non-invasive MRI-technique, has been suggested as an alternative method in the evaluation of children with symptomatic UTI.

Renal parenchymal lesions detected in imaging of younger infants with an UTI may have different etiologies, such as acute inflammation i.e. acute pyelonephritis, permanent renal damage or dysplastic changes that are important to differentiate as it will impact the clinical management of the patient. DWI in multiple direction, i.e. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can give an insight into the microstructure of the renal tissue as the use of multiple diffusion directions better depicts the highly radiating oriented renal structure. This technique enables calculation of several quantitative measures that can be used in the diagnosis together with the findings from the visual evaluation. The comprehensive analysis of multiple DTI parameters i.e. multiparametric DTI, can provide further information that may improve the characterization of renal lesions in infants with symptomatic UTI. Recent studies have shown the potential of the technique to evaluate renal pathology in older children. It has also been shown that free breathing DTI is feasible and can generate images with higher quality compared to conventional DWI in children with acute pyelonephritis. To our knowledge, there are no studies on renal DTI in young infants, a patient group that would benefit from the use of this non-invasive, non-radiating, short scan technique. The potential of DWI for detection of acute pyelonephritis has recently been shown in non-sedated free breathing infants with symptomatic UTI. However, in several infants' lesions the findings were equivocal and not typical for acute pyelonephritis raising the need for further characterization of such lesions.

In conclusion, this is a pilot study in our institution to identify clinical and laboratory risk factors associated with imaging abnormalities after the first febrile UTI in infants ≤ 3 months old. Non- E. coli UTI was independently associated with imaging abnormalities, while bacteraemia and non- E. coli UTI were independently associated with recurrent UTI. Future studies are required to build a robust prediction model to aid physicians in risk stratifying infants after the first episode of pyelonephritis and therefore avoiding unnecessary investigations and follow-up.

### Predictors of abnormal renal ultrasonography in children with urinary tract infection [^111mhKXB]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommended a renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) after the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants. Abnormal RBUS findings may be due to inflammation from the acute UTI or from vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which may require a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to diagnose, increasing health care costs. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of timing of imaging relative to the acute illness on abnormal dilation on RBUS and VCUG findings.

Methods

Multicenter, retrospective study of patients aged 2 to 24 months presenting with first UTI and RBUS from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. Demographics, isolated pathogen, and timing of RBUS and VCUG relative to urine culture date were recorded and compared.

Results

A total of 227 patients were included. On multivariable logistic regression, increased time in days to RBUS was associated with decreased odds of abnormal dilation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.980; p = 0.018) in those patients meeting culture criteria for UTI (for each additional day of delay in obtaining RBUS, the adjusted odds of detecting dilation decreased by ∼2%). There was no significant association between timing of imaging and VUR on VCUG. Additionally, 32% of patients underwent RBUS who did not meet UTI culture criteria but had similar rates of abnormal dilation and VUR to those meeting UTI culture criteria.

Conclusions

Increased time to RBUS led to decreased odds of abnormal dilation, suggesting that delaying RBUS may lead to fewer false-positive results, which may limit unnecessary additional testing and reduce health care costs. Additionally, a significant number of patients who did not meet UTI culture criteria underwent RBUS but had similar results to those meeting criteria, suggesting that the previous colony-forming unit definition for UTI may be suboptimal.

### Imaging in urinary tract infections: current strategies and new trends [^112Gh2k2]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to detect abnormalities that require appropriate treatment or findings that can be acted on to prevent development of complications (hypertension, chronic renal failure or pregnancy-related complications). Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children.

This article is focused on the controversial topic of imaging strategies in pediatric urinary tract infection. A review of the recent literature illustrates the complementary roles of ultrasound, diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine. The authors stress the key role of ultrasound which has recently been debated. The commonly associated vesicoureteric reflux has to be classified as congenital or secondary due to voiding dysfunction. A series of frequently asked questions are addressed in a second section. The proposed answers are not the product of a consensus but should rather be considered as proposals to enrich the ongoing debate concerning the evaluation of urinary tract infection in children.

### Evidence basis for individualized evaluation and less imaging in febrile urinary tract infection: an editorial commentary [^1112NLGJ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a remarkable retreat from previous dogma regarding urinary tract infections (UTIs). Less aggressive imaging is now recommended because although vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is frequently found in children with a history of febrile UTIs, most VUR resolves spontaneously and we do not have evidence that treatment of the rest improves outcome. Available evidence suggests urine testing for UTI can be less aggressive as well, focusing on those with the most risk factors for UTI, those with the most severe illness, and those at highest risk of complications.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112pbeqA]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Renal and bladder ultrasonography after initial febrile UTI — Febrile infants with UTIs should undergo renal and bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) (evidence quality: C; recommendation). The purpose of RBUS is to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation, such as additional imaging or urologic consultation, and RBUS also provides an evaluation of the renal parenchyma and an assessment of renal size that can be used to monitor renal growth. The yield of actionable findings is relatively low, and widespread application of prenatal ultrasonography clearly has reduced the prevalence of previously unsuspected obstructive uropathy in infants, but the consequences of prenatal screening with respect to the risk of renal abnormalities in infants with UTIs have not yet been well defined.

Further Imaging

In post-acute infection, urinary tract USS may help define urological abnormalities (GRADE C).
USS/CT/MRI can be useful to follow a renal abscess (GRADES C and D).
Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and DMSA are now saved for specific instances where less invasive investigations do not give enough prognostic information, usually for children with severe urological abnormalities (GRADE D).

Ultrasound Scan

After the first episode of upper UTI, children under the age of 3 years should have a renal tract USS after the acute phase to detect potential structural abnormalities or parenchymal lesions. Obtaining an USS and MCUG after the first UTI in young children is, however, not strongly supported by high-grade evidence. A prospective study involving 309 children showed that the identified abnormalities, which were found in 12 percent (37/309) of the children, and obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, did not modify management. Some guidelines recommend USS in case of atypical or recurrent UTI. Children who are older than 2–24 months who experience recurrent febrile UTIs should also be evaluated, though USS has a poor sensitivity for detecting mild-moderate VUR. Due to its rarity, there is a gap of evidence regarding recommendations of follow-up in children with suspected nephronia or abscess, but they may benefit from further imaging with MRI or CT.

Micturating Cystourethrography

Many guidelines recommend performing a MCUG after abnormal USS findings, non- E. coli causative pathogens or recurrent UTI. Combinations of unusual pathogens and pathological USS increase the probability of high-grade VUR to over 50%.

DMSA Scan

Although the specificity for detecting high-grade VUR after DMSA renal scan is low, they can detect renal scars, differences in relative renal function between the kidneys and deterioration of renal function or new scars over time.DMSA and its timing remain controversial for the evaluation of a child after cUTI, but children with high-grade VUR or recurrent UTI should undergo a DMSA scan to keep track of renal damage.DMSA should be performed 3–6 months after the acute episode so that transient inflammatory changes have resolved. In 1 study, the incidence of renal scarring was associated with the severity of renal parenchymal infection, with 22% of children with pyelonephritis having scars, 44% with nephronia and 72% with abscess.

### Urinary imaging findings in young infants with bacteremic urinary tract infection [^1154eysg]. Hospital Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe renal ultrasound (RUS) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) findings and determine predictors of abnormal imaging in young infants with bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

We used retrospective data from a multicenter sample of infants younger than 3 months with bacteremic UTI, defined as the same pathogenic organism in blood and urine. Infants were excluded if they had any major comorbidities, known urologic abnormalities at time of presentation, required intensive unit care, or had no imaging performed. Imaging results as stated in the radiology reports were categorized by a pediatric urologist.

Results

Of the 276 infants, 19 were excluded. Of the remaining 257 infants, 254 underwent a RUS and 224 underwent a VCUG. Fifty-five percent had ≥ 1 RUS abnormalities. Thirty-four percent had ≥ 1 VCUG abnormalities, including vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, 27%), duplication (1.3%), and infravesicular abnormality (0.9%). Age < 1 month, male sex, and non-Escherichia coli organism predicted an abnormal RUS, but only non-E coli organism predicted an abnormal VCUG. Seventeen of 96 infants (17.7%) with a normal RUS had an abnormal VCUG: 15 with VUR (Grade I-III = 13, Grade IV = 2), 2 with elevated postvoid residual, and 1 with infravesical abnormality.

Conclusions

Although RUS and VCUG abnormalities were common in this cohort, the frequency and severity were similar to previous studies of infants with UTIs in general. Our findings do not support special consideration of bacteremia in imaging decisions for otherwise well-appearing young infants with UTI.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Imaging strategy for infants with urinary tract infection: a new algorithm [^111aP7jz]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We analyzed clinical data for prediction of permanent renal damage in infants with first time urinary tract infection.

Materials and Methods

This population based, prospective, 3-year study included 161 male and 129 female consecutive infants with first time urinary tract infection. Ultrasonography and dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were performed as acute investigations and voiding cystourethrography within 2 months. Late scintigraphy was performed after 1 year in infants with abnormality on the first dimercapto-succinic acid scan or recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. End point was renal damage on the late scan.

Results

A total of 270 patients had end point data available, of whom 70 had renal damage and 200 did not. Final kidney status was associated with C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, temperature, leukocyturia, non-Escherichia coli bacteria, anteroposterior diameter on ultrasound and recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. In stepwise multiple regression analysis C-reactive protein, creatinine, leukocyturia, anteroposterior diameter and non-E.coli bacteria were independent predictors of permanent renal damage. C-reactive protein 70 mg/l or greater combined with anteroposterior diameter 10 mm or greater had sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 59% for renal damage. An algorithm for imaging of infants with first time urinary tract infection based on these results would have eliminated 126 acute dimercapto-succinic acid scans compared to our study protocol, while missing 9 patients with permanent renal damage.

Conclusions

C-reactive protein can be used as a predictor of permanent renal damage in infants with urinary tract infection and together with anteroposterior diameter serves as a basis for an imaging algorithm.
