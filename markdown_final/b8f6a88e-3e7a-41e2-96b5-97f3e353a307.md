## Question

How long to hold eliquis for dental extraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage Eliquis (apixaban) in the context of a dental extraction, specifically regarding how long to hold it before the procedure, when to restart it, and what local measures to use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the procedure's bleeding risk and whether dental extractions are low, moderate, or high risk. Then, I should verify apixaban's pharmacokinetics and how that translates into pre-procedural interruption intervals. Next, I will review major guidelines and prospective studies for DOAC management in low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors that could modify timing, such as renal function, dose, and concomitant medications. Finally, I will outline practical peri-procedural steps, including local hemostatic strategies and when to consider DOAC level testing or reversal, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats for special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the procedure risk category. Simple dental extractions are generally considered low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures, and many contemporary guidelines and studies support either continuation or brief interruption of DOACs depending on bleeding risk tolerance and local hemostatic capability, so I should not overcall this as high risk unless multiple extractions, extensive surgery, or significant comorbidity are present [^116nqRDb] [^114Ucaym] [^115YnoZD].

> Now, I need to check apixaban's pharmacokinetics to anchor timing. Apixaban has a half-life of roughly 8–15 hours, is dosed twice daily, and achieves peak effect about 3–4 hours after ingestion; importantly, it has minimal renal clearance relative to dabigatran, so renal function has less impact on interruption intervals than with dabigatran, though I should still verify extremes of renal impairment separately [^1147od5Y].

> Next, I should review guideline-based interruption intervals. The FDA label advises holding apixaban at least 24 hours before low-bleed-risk procedures and at least 48 hours before moderate-to-high-bleed-risk procedures, with no routine bridging required. ACCP suggests 1–2 days off depending on procedural bleed risk. ASIPP recommends 1 day for low-to-moderate risk and 2 days for high risk. And the European Society of Anaesthesiology suggests 3 days before intermediate/high-risk procedures, which is more conservative and likely reflects worst-case pharmacokinetics and neuraxial safety considerations rather than typical dental risk [^116W3hkD] [^111HNhJG] [^1147od5Y] [^115keWki].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify what prospective data show for low-to-moderate risk procedures. The PAUSE program demonstrated very low 30-day thromboembolism and major bleeding rates with standardized interruption of 1 day before and 1 day after low-to-moderate risk procedures, and the PERIXa cohort specifically in AF patients undergoing minimal-to-low risk procedures (including dental work) used a pragmatic protocol of holding the last dose 24 hours before and resuming the next day, achieving a 0.1% major bleeding rate and 0% thromboembolism at 30 days; this supports a 24-hour hold for many dental extractions when combined with local hemostasis [^111vkUs8] [^115YnoZD] [^1138CPtm].

> I should double-check whether continuation is ever reasonable. For truly minimal-risk dental procedures, some guidance allows continuation of DOACs with meticulous local hemostasis. However, for extractions, most clinicians favor at least a brief hold to reduce peak-effect bleeding, and observational dental cohorts suggest that if DOACs are continued, scheduling at trough and avoiding multiple contiguous multirooted extractions can mitigate bleeding risk, though this requires careful case selection and local expertise [^116nqRDb] [^113Dwq73].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers. Renal impairment beyond moderate-to-severe levels may warrant extending the interruption, particularly for agents cleared renally; however, apixaban is less dependent on renal excretion than dabigatran, so for CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min the standard 24–48 hour intervals are generally sufficient, whereas for CrCl 15–29 mL/min some experts extend to 36–48 hours for low-to-moderate risk procedures; concomitant strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors increase apixaban exposure and may justify a longer hold or dose reduction in the peri-procedural window; and patients on reduced-dose apixaban (2.5 mg BID) still follow the same interruption intervals because the pharmacokinetics are unchanged even though clinical bleeding risk may be lower [^114rFZvm] [^112TtCuJ] [^11239tzh].

> Next, I should review local hemostatic strategies because interruption alone is not enough. Local antifibrinolytic therapy, particularly tranexamic acid mouth rinse used pre-procedure and for 1–2 days post-procedure, reduces bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants undergoing dental procedures. Meticulous mechanical measures such as firm pressure, oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponges, sutures, and avoidance of early rinsing are standard. And scheduling the extraction at least 4 hours after the last dose (i.e., at trough) further reduces intraoperative anticoagulant effect if DOAC is continued or if timing is tight [^115kkJ3S] [^114Ucaym] [^113Dwq73].

> I will now examine post-procedural resumption. Most contemporary protocols resume apixaban 24 hours after the procedure once secure hemostasis is confirmed. The FDA label supports restarting as soon as adequate hemostasis is established, and PAUSE operationalized 24 hours post-procedure for low-to-moderate risk surgeries with excellent safety outcomes. If hemostasis is tenuous or multiple extractions were performed, delaying to 48 hours is reasonable, but routine bridging is not indicated for DOACs given their rapid onset [^116W3hkD] [^111vkUs8] [^116nqRDb].

> But wait, what if the extraction is urgent or the bleeding risk is unusually high. In urgent scenarios where interruption is insufficient, measuring a calibrated anti–factor Xa level can help decide on reversal; andexanet alfa is the specific reversal agent for apixaban, and 4-factor PCC is a reasonable alternative if andexanet is unavailable; activated charcoal may be considered if ingestion was recent (within 2–4 hours), though this is less applicable to planned extractions [^111iFpQH] [^117FwtsZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For a simple dental extraction in a patient with normal renal function taking standard-dose apixaban, hold the morning dose on the day of the procedure and the evening dose the night before (i.e., skip about 24 hours), perform the extraction with local hemostatic measures including tranexamic acid rinse, and resume apixaban the next morning once hemostasis is secure. For multiple extractions, extensive surgery, or if the patient prefers a more conservative approach, extend the pre-procedural hold to 48 hours and resume 24–48 hours post-procedure, recognizing that evidence supports low complication rates with the shorter 24-hour strategy when local hemostasis is optimized [^115YnoZD] [^111vkUs8] [^114Ucaym].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the European guidance might directly apply to dental extractions, but I should verify that. The ESAIC 3-day recommendation targets intermediate/high-risk procedures and incorporates neuraxial safety margins. For routine dental extractions, that 3-day interval is overly conservative, so I should not extrapolate it to simple extractions unless there are additional high-risk features or concurrent medications that markedly increase bleeding risk [^115keWki] [^116nqRDb].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication. I should confirm the indication for anticoagulation and the patient's thrombotic risk, coordinate timing with the prescriber, record the exact interruption and resumption plan, and provide clear post-procedural instructions on bleeding control and when to seek care. This aligns with FDA patient counseling and perioperative safety principles for DOACs [^1145nfEU] [^116nqRDb].

Hold Eliquis (apixaban) for **24 hours before low-risk dental extractions** (≤ 3 teeth, no extensive surgery) and **48 hours before high-risk extractions** (> 3 teeth, surgical/complex). Resume **24 hours after hemostasis** for low-risk and 48–72 hours for high-risk procedures. Bridging is not required, and local hemostatic measures (e.g. tranexamic acid mouthwash) are recommended [^116W3hkD] [^115kkJ3S]. Individualize for renal impairment, bleeding risk, or drug interactions [^117FwtsZ].

---

## Recommended timing for Eliquis interruption

The timing of Eliquis interruption depends on the **bleeding risk** associated with the dental extraction procedure:

| **Procedure risk** | **Definition** | **Recommended interruption** |
|-|-|-|
| Low risk | - Simple extraction of 1–3 teeth <br/> - No extensive flap or bone removal <br/> - No history of bleeding disorders | Hold 24 hours before procedure [^116W3hkD] |
| High risk | - Multiple extractions (> 3 teeth) <br/> - Surgical or complex extractions <br/> - Extensive flap or bone removal <br/> - History of bleeding disorders | Hold 48 hours before procedure [^116W3hkD] |

---

These recommendations align with the FDA label, which advises holding Eliquis for at least 24 hours before low-risk procedures and 48 hours before high-risk procedures [^116W3hkD].

---

## Resumption of Eliquis after dental extraction

After the procedure, **resume Eliquis once adequate hemostasis is established**:

- **Low-risk procedures**: Resume 24 hours after hemostasis [^111vkUs8].
- **High-risk procedures**: Resume 48–72 hours after hemostasis.

Bridging anticoagulation is generally not required during the interruption period because of Eliquis's short half-life and rapid onset of action [^116W3hkD] [^116nqRDb].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current recommendations

Clinical studies and guidelines support these interruption intervals, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks:

- **PAUSE study**: Prospective management of DOACs (including apixaban) showed low rates of major bleeding (1.35%) and thromboembolism (0.16%) with standardized interruption protocols [^111vkUs8].
- **PERIXa study**: Prospective cohort of 1,902 patients undergoing minimal-to-low risk procedures (including dental) found very low major bleeding (0.1%) and no thromboembolic events with a 24-hour interruption protocol [^1138CPtm].
- **ACCP guidelines**: Recommend stopping apixaban 1–2 days before elective procedures based on bleeding risk, with no routine bridging [^1136WZW8].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing interruption duration

Several factors may necessitate **individualized interruption intervals**:

- **Renal impairment**: Consider longer interruptions (≥ 48 hours) in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) due to reduced clearance [^114rFZvm].
- **Bleeding risk**: Patients with high bleeding risk may require longer interruptions and additional local hemostatic measures [^116nqRDb].
- **Drug interactions**: Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors may increase apixaban levels, warranting longer interruptions [^117FwtsZ].

---

## Risks associated with interruption of Eliquis

Interrupting Eliquis increases the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. However, **short interruptions (24–48 hours)** with appropriate resumption and local hemostatic measures have been shown to minimize these risks [^1138CPtm] [^111vkUs8].

---

## Local hemostatic measures

Local hemostatic measures are **essential** to minimize bleeding during dental extractions:

- **Tranexamic acid mouthwash**: 5% solution, 10 mL for 2 minutes, before and after procedure, repeated 2–3 times daily for 1–2 days [^114Ucaym].
- **Gelatin sponge or oxidized cellulose**: Place in extraction sockets to promote clot formation.
- **Firm pressure**: Apply gauze pressure for at least 30 minutes post-extraction.
- **Suturing**: Consider suturing to stabilize the clot, especially in high-risk patients.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low-risk procedures**: Hold Eliquis 24 hours before, resume 24 hours after hemostasis.
- **High-risk procedures**: Hold Eliquis 48 hours before, resume 48–72 hours after hemostasis.
- **Bridging**: Not routinely required.
- **Local hemostatic measures**: Tranexamic acid mouthwash, gelatin sponge, firm pressure, suturing.

---

Hold Eliquis for **24 hours before low-risk extractions** and **48 hours before high-risk extractions**, then resume 24–72 hours after hemostasis; bridging is not needed, and local hemostatic measures should be used.

What is the most important information I should know about apixaban tablets?

- **For people taking apixaban tablets for atrial fibrillation**: People with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. Apixaban tablets lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking apixaban tablets, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking apixaban tablets without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping apixaban tablets increases your risk of having a stroke.

Apixaban tablets may need to be stopped, if possible, prior to surgery or a medical or dental procedure. Ask the doctor who prescribed apixaban tablets for you when you should stop taking it. Your doctor will tell you when you may start taking apixaban tablets again after your surgery or procedure. If you have to stop taking apixaban tablets, your doctor may prescribe another medicine to help prevent a blood clot from forming.

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

14.3 Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

Efficacy and safety of ELIQUIS for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment was derived from the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies. Both studies were randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trials in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE. All key safety and efficacy endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded manner by an independent committee.

AMPLIFY

The primary objective of AMPLIFY was to determine whether ELIQUIS was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin for the incidence of recurrent VTE (venous thromboembolism) or VTE-related death. Patients with an objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 10 mg twice daily orally for 7 days followed by ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR ≥ 2) followed by warfarin (target INR range 2.0–3.0) orally for 6 months. Patients who required thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent, and patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, significant liver disease, an existing heart valve or atrial fibrillation, or active bleeding were excluded from the AMPLIFY study. Patients were allowed to enter the study with or without prior parenteral anticoagulation (up to 48 hours).

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE? In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the population was: 1669 patients (714 female, 955 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring an ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of < 9 mg/dL; platelet count < 100,000/mm²; serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 840 apixaban (2.5 mg BID for 12 months) n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.33). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause (3.8% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.48) No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.12) Significant decrease in recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD-related death (2.1% vs. 10%; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and adverse events. significant differences in VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death, or major bleeding (2.4% vs. 10.4%). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114gi2UN]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Dental procedures in patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — management strategy: In patients receiving VKA therapy who need a dental procedure, we suggest using a pro-hemostatic agent with continuation of VKA over alternative management options (eg, discontinuation of VKA with or without heparin bridging) (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). Pro-hemostatic options include pre- and post-procedure administration of oral tranexamic acid mouthwash, two to three times daily, and intervention-specific measures, and because the risk for dental procedure-related bleeding may vary, VKA interruption may be preferred in situations where oral bleeding is expected to be considerable.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

The limited available data on ELIQUIS use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform drug-associated risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse developmental outcomes. Treatment may increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy and delivery. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were seen when apixaban was administered to rats (orally), rabbits (intravenously) and mice (orally) during organogenesis at unbound apixaban exposure levels up to 4, 1 and 19 times, respectively, the human exposure based on area under plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) at the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 5 mg twice daily.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Pregnancy confers an increased risk of thromboembolism that is higher for women with underlying thromboembolic disease and certain high-risk pregnancy conditions. Published data describe that women with a previous history of venous thrombosis are at high risk for recurrence during pregnancy.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of anticoagulants, including ELIQUIS, may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate.

Labor or delivery

All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. ELIQUIS use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas. Consider use of a shorter acting anticoagulant as delivery approaches [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Data

Animal Data

No developmental toxicities were observed when apixaban was administered during organogenesis to rats (orally), rabbits (intravenously) and mice (orally) at unbound apixaban exposure levels 4, 1, and 19 times, respectively, the human exposures at the MRHD. There was no evidence of fetal bleeding, although conceptus exposure was confirmed in rats and rabbits. Oral administration of apixaban to rat dams from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at maternal unbound apixaban exposures ranging from 1.4 to 5 times the human exposures at the MRHD was not associated with reduced maternal mortality or reduced conceptus/neonatal viability, although increased incidences of peri-vaginal bleeding were observed in dams at all doses. There was no evidence of neonatal bleeding.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115GtXFU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE? In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the population was: 1642 patients (705 female, 937 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring an ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of < 9 mg/dL; platelet count < 100,000/mm²; serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 813 apixaban (5 mg BID for 12 months) n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.34). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause (4.2% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.53) No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.6% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.33) Significant decrease in recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD-related death (2.3% vs. 10%; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.38). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and adverse events. significant differences in VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death, or major bleeding (2.5% vs. 10.4%). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and medical comorbidities in patients needing dental extractions: management of the risk of bleeding [^113Dwq73]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to measure the frequency of bleeding during and after tooth extraction in patients exposed to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and identify risk factors for prolonged or excessive bleeding.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study involved 100 patients who underwent tooth extractions according to the European Heart Rhythm Association protocol: continuation of DOAC therapy for extractions of up to 3 teeth in the same session performed at the (presumed) time of DOAC trough concentration. We respected an interval of at least 4 hours between extraction and last DOAC intake. The outcome of interest was incidence of mild, moderate, and severe bleeding during the intervention and in the 7-day follow-up period. Data analysis considered the presence of comorbidities as the primary predictor for bleeding; additional predictors were age, gender, type of comorbidity, indication for DOAC therapy, DOAC agent, and extraction of contiguous teeth.

Results

Of the patients, 64 had comorbidities (diabetes in 50%). The distributions of demographic, clinical, and dental variables were similar for patients with and without comorbidities. We observed 4 bleeding episodes (1 moderate episode 1 hour after the extraction and 3 mild episodes the day after the extraction) in the comorbidity group and none in the non-comorbidity group (4 of 64 vs 0 of 36, P = 0.29; overall bleeding rate, 4 of 100). The factor significantly triggering bleeding in patients with comorbidity was extractions of couples and triplets of multirooted teeth (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Tooth extractions in patients with comorbidities taking DOACs may be safely managed as long as they are performed at least 4 hours after the last DOAC intake and do not involve 2 or 3 contiguous premolars and molars.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^114fUYjd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of the PERIXa study lies in its prospective enrollment of 1902 patients undergoing planned procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, along with its inclusion of valuable edoxaban periprocedural data (n = 616 [32.4%]), which is limited in this research field. This study demonstrated a simplified DOAC interruption protocol before and after these interventions, making communicating with patients and health care professionals easier. This protocol resulted in a very low major bleeding event rate and no thromboembolic events at 30 days. A recent reviewproposes a slightly shorter, near noninterruption protocol than the PERIXa study. Their protocol suggests omitting twice daily DOACs only on the morning of the procedure and delaying once daily DOACs slightly beyond their usual ingestion time. However, this recommendation lacks support from evidence encompassing a wide range of large-scale procedures or 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Moreover, the absence of a defined discontinuation protocol can raise patient and health care professionals' concerns about postprocedure hemostasis difficulties, potentially leading to unnecessary and prolonged DOAC discontinuation.

Table 5
Follow‐up Demographics

Of the remaining 17 patients who did not have clinic or primary care physician follow‐up, four were contacted by telephone and had elected to stop taking rivaroxaban against medical advice. Ten others had histories and physical examinations documented in INPC that confirmed they were alive, with no written evidence of current or prior bleeding or recurrent VTE. Three patients had no concrete follow‐up. All three had Indianapolis addresses, but could not be contacted by telephone, had no visits documented in the INPC, and were absent from the SSDI.

Two patients died from causes unrelated to VTE or rivaroxaban treatment. One patient had end‐stage metastatic cancer and the other had end‐stage liver disease. Both elected to receive comfort care measures because of the severity and futility of their disease processes, one during the treatment period (who subsequently stopped all medications, including rivaroxaban) and the other post treatment.

No patient had a major bleeding event. Two patients called study physicians about bleeding: one with menorrhagia and the second with jaw swelling after elective dental extraction. Both patients were instructed to hold one dose of rivaroxaban and were encouraged to seek medical care if needed, but neither required additional follow‐up or an unscheduled physician visit. Two additional patients noted menorrhagia on standard questioning during a clinic visit. Both had normal Hb concentrations and prothrombin times of < 15 seconds. Both were given instructions to hold one dose of rivaroxaban for worsened menorrhagia. None of these events met the definition of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^115jWUCw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The EMANATE (Eliquis evaluated in acute cardioversion compared to usual treatments for Anticoagulation in subjects with atrial fibrillation) trial is a randomized, prospective, open‐label trial evaluating apixaban versus usual care with heparin plus VKA during elective cardioversion for new‐onset NVAF (diagnosed within 3 months before randomization) in 1500 patients who are anticoagulation‐naïve (< 48 hours of parenteral and/or oral anticoagulation). 44, 45 The study has notable exclusion criteria including severely hemodynamically unstable patients requiring emergent cardioversion, other conditions requiring anticoagulation, dual antiplatelet therapy use, and valvular heart disease (including mitral stenosis, mechanical and prosthetic valves, and valve repair). The study required 5 doses of apixaban before cardioversion, allowing for a single 10‐mg dose (or 5 mg for patients meeting standard criteria for dose adjustment) if urgent cardioversion is planned at a minimum of 2 hours before cardioversion. For patients in the usual‐care arm, similar timing was allowed after administration of heparin. Of note, 55% of the apixaban group received TEE before cardioversion. This study demonstrated that apixaban was effective in preventing SSE at 30‐day (with cardioversion) or 90‐day (without cardioversion) follow‐up with zero patients in the apixaban group and 6 patients in the warfarin/heparin group experiencing SSE (5 ischemic strokes, 1 hemorrhagic stroke, and zero systemic embolic events), P = 0.015. Bleeding risk was also similar, with 3 major bleeds in the apixaban group and 6 major bleeds in the warfarin/heparin group (P = 0.338). Roughly half of the patients in the apixaban group (342 out of 753) received a loading dose. The mean time from apixaban loading dose to cardioversion was 3.3 days (standard deviation 8.8 days) in patients with imaging and 4.1 days (standard deviation 9.5 days) in patients without imaging. In this loading‐dose group, there were zero SSE, 1 major bleed, and 1 death. The mean time to cardioversion in patients not receiving an apixaban loading dose was 21.7 days (standard deviation 14.6 days) with imaging and 32.5 days (standard deviation 21.2 days) without imaging. The mean time to cardioversion in the heparin plus VKA group was 17.8 days. The EMANATE trial represents the largest sample size to date for evaluation of an early cardioversion group. This was also the only trial to utilize a loading dose (10 or 5 mg for patients meeting standard criteria for dose adjustment) given at least 2 hours before cardioversion, which appears appropriate based on its pharmacokinetic evaluation where AUC and Cmax after 1 dose of 10 mg was higher than 7 days of the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. The study was also limited by an open‐label design and similar to the other prospective trials, was a descriptive study without hypothesis testing or power calculations (Table 3).

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Advise patients of the following:

Not to discontinue ELIQUIS without talking to their physician first.
That it might take longer than usual for bleeding to stop, and they may bruise or bleed more easily when treated with ELIQUIS. Advise patients about how to recognize bleeding or symptoms of hypovolemia and of the urgent need to report any unusual bleeding to their physician.
To tell their physicians and dentists they are taking ELIQUIS, and/or any other product known to affect bleeding (including nonprescription products, such as aspirin or NSAIDs), before any surgery or medical or dental procedure is scheduled and before any new drug is taken.
If the patient is having neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, inform the patient to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to seek emergent medical attention.
To tell their physicians if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during treatment with ELIQUIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].
How to take ELIQUIS if they cannot swallow or require a nasogastric tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture

When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.

The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

No data are available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheters in pediatric patients while on ELIQUIS. In such cases, discontinue ELIQUIS and consider a short acting parenteral anticoagulant.

5.4 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves

The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of ELIQUIS is not recommended in these patients.

5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy

Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including ELIQUIS, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115mGq71]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at ≤ 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+).

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. 1 DOACs are categorized into 2 main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (ie, dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the following years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; ie, warfarin), or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. 2, 3, 4, 5 Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. 6 As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 7

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome and challenging to integrate into everyday clinical use. The purpose of this review is to be a practical reference or algorithm for the busy clinician to navigate key aspects of effective DOAC prescribing, with an emphasis on addressing key situations where clinical uncertainty exists. This review will provide recommendations to address special clinical situations to include indications, use in specific comorbidities, monitoring parameters, transitioning to or off of therapy, drug interactions, and cost.

4.2 Comparison with published data

The first data on the periprocedural outcomes of NOAC were derived as sub‐analyses from the large Phase III studies of these compounds. In a sub‐study of the ARISTOTLE trial, 10 the periprocedural management of apixaban was associated with an incidence of MB of 1.62% and of stroke or systemic embolism of 0.35% at 30 days. In 37.5% of patients apixaban treatment was not interrupted periprocedurally. ("Interruption" was defined as no interruption of any dose or interruption on the same day of the operation, which allowed two doses of apixaban to be omitted, and is different from the definition of interruption in the present study.) A sub‐ analysis of the RE‐LY study 22 found an incidence of major periprocedural bleeding from 7 days before until 30 days of 3.8% for the 110 mg and 5.1% for the 150 mg two times daily regimens. Dabigatran‐treated patients received the last dose a median of 49 (interquartile range, 35‐85) hours before the procedure. The incidence of a composite of thrombotic events ranged from 1.2% for the lower and 1.5% for the higher dabigatran dose. In a post‐hoc analysis of ENGAGE AF‐TIMI, 14 in the group of patients with periprocedural anticoagulant interruption, major periprocedural bleeding occurred in warfarin treated patients (1.0%), high dose edoxaban (1.2%) and low dose edoxaban (1.1%). Stroke or systemic embolism rates for the same groups were 0.6%, 0.5%, and 0.9%. In the group of patients with no periprocedural anticoagulant interruption, major periprocedural bleeding occurred in warfarin treated patients (3.6%), high dose edoxaban (2.6%) and low dose edoxaban (2.4%). Stroke or systemic embolism rates for the same groups were 1.1%, 0.7%, and 0.9%. Our data on edoxaban show a similar safety signal in terms of MB episodes.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for 2 main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (eg, for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (eg, extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

Observations

Among 4191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban) or (postdischarge) high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban), in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, or after a recent revascularization for peripheral artery disease in conjunction with aspirin (rivaroxaban). Minor variations exist between regulatory authorities in different regions regarding criteria for dose adjustment of DOACs. Data from large registries indicated that dose-reduced DOACs were used occasionally with doses or for clinical scenarios different from those studied in RCTs or recommended by regulatory authorities.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dose adjustment and low-intensity treatment are 2 different forms of dose-reduced DOACs. Dose adjustment is mostly relevant for AF and should be done based on the approved criteria. Dose adjustment of DOACs should not be used for acute VTE treatment in most cases. In contrast, low-intensity DOACs may be used for primary or secondary VTE prevention for studied and approved indications. Attention should be given to routine practice patterns to align the daily clinical practice with existing evidence of safety and efficacy.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^111KQpY9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Study Population and Procedure

Between September 25, 2020, and April 5, 2024, eligible participants included adults with AF receiving a factor Xa inhibitor (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) who were scheduled to undergo procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, including endoscopy, dental procedures, and ocular surgery. Full eligibility criteria are provided in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2.

Patients who were referred by the operator to cardiologists for preprocedural consultations regarding DOAC discontinuation before procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk were screened by the cardiologist. eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2 provides the list of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. After providing written informed consent, eligible patients were enrolled. Once enrolled, patients were informed of the preprocedure and postprocedure drug discontinuation protocols, and operators of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk were also informed of study enrollment and the factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation protocol in a protocolized document.

The PERIXa discontinuation protocol is provided in eFigure 1A in Supplement 2. The PERIXa protocol was largely based on the EHRA protocol, with modifications to make it more user-friendly and clearer for each factor Xa inhibitor application. For apixaban, taken twice daily, the protocol was to discontinue the evening dose a day before the procedure and the morning dose on the procedure day. If the procedure was performed in the morning, the evening dose could be restarted after hemostasis was achieved. The usual protocol was to resume the regular schedule the next morning. For once-daily edoxaban and rivaroxaban, the protocol was to discontinue on the morning of the procedure and resume the next morning.

For patients who underwent the planned procedure, we examined the actual procedure details, the duration of drug discontinuation, and the clinical outcomes immediately after the procedure, as well as at 7 and 30 days after the procedure (eFigure 1B in Supplement 2). Additionally, the operator who performed the procedure was asked to provide details about the actual procedure and the level of bleeding and hemostasis observed during the operation. The survey questions are available in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2.

### Dental surgery in anticoagulated patients… [^114Zp6qc]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Many authorities state that dental extractions can be performed with minimal risk in patients who are at or above therapeutic levels of anticoagulation. There are sound legal reasons to continue therapeutic levels of warfarin for dental treatment. Although there is a theoretical risk of hemorrhage after dental surgery in patients who are at therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, the risk appears to be minimal, the bleeding usually can be easily treated with local measures, and this risk may be greatly outweighed by the risk of thromboembolism after withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy. amoxicillin was administered. 39 Interestingly, although this patient's INR was an astounding 9. 1 one week after the extraction, only 1 socket was bleeding, and this bleeding was only described as "oozing, " indicating that the hospitalization may have been precautionary for the high INR and not for the oozing.

The authors speculated that the antibiotics caused the increase in INR and subsequent bleeding and oozing, although there may have been other causes, including warfarin overdose. In the third case, the patient had a therapeutic preoperative INR of 3. 51 for 20 extractions and an alveoplasty, and there was good hemostasis 72 hours postoperatively. 21 Although antibiotic prophylaxis has not been shown to be necessary or effective in preventing postextraction wound infections, 45 prophylaxis with amoxicillin, 500 mg 3 times daily for 7 days after surgery, had been prescribed. At a minimum, the application of pressure is required immediately after dental extractions, especially in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.

But dental extractions are different from other types of surgery: major vessels are unlikely to be encountered, and postoperative bleeding is usually controlled within minutes by application of pressure or, if necessary, additional local measures such as biting on tea bags or using gelatin sponges, topical thrombin, additional sutures, and even electrocautery. Only 2 anticoagulant-treated patients had significantly greater blood loss per tooth than the control group. Bailey and Fordyce20 compared the result of extractions in 25 anticoagulant-treated patients with that of 25 control patients and found no difference in immediate postoperative bleeding. There was more "late bleeding" in the anticoagulated group, which was "easily controlled" by local measures.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117FwtsZ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — pre-operative DOAC level testing and circumstances for longer interruption are outlined: Measurement of DOAC levels before the surgery/procedure may be considered in patients who require an urgent (ie, within 24 hours) surgery, because routine coagulation tests such as the INR or aPTT may be insensitive; testing options include DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, though questions remain as to their clinical utility. There may be selected patients in whom a longer duration of pre-operative DOAC interruption may be required due to the longer time required for drug clearance as 75% to 80% of dabigatran clearance is by the kidney and in those with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction or taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein pathways.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

Observations

For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (eg, minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (eg, major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent (eg, prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet-α) prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^111CRk6L]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran dosing and pharmacology: Direct oral anticoagulants include factor IIa, dabigatran (Pradaxa); and factor Xa, apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) inhibitors. After an oral dose of dabigatran, maximal effects are observed within 2 to 4 hours and the plasma half-life is 13 hours on average. Dosing depends on renal function, with patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than 30mL/minute receiving 150 mg orally twice a day and those with a creatinine clearance lower than 30mL/minute receiving 75 mg given twice daily as recommended. Because dabigatran functions via factor inhibition and not clotting factor depletion, the administration of clotting factors in an effort to reverse the effects of the drug is less effective, and the drug is primarily renally excreted with time to excretion varying depending on renal sufficiency.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114Ucaym]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Dental procedures in patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) — For minor dental procedures (single and multiple tooth extractions and endodontic procedures), we suggest continuation of VKA over VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). A meta-analysis found no significant increase in intra-procedural bleeding with continuation (RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 0.97–2.89) or post-procedural bleeding (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.71–2.92). Overall, continuing VKAs is associated with a low (approximately 5%) risk for any bleeding, with such bleeding considered self-limiting; thromboembolic outcomes appeared rare (< 0.1%). Partial interruption of VKA for 2 to 3 days before the procedure is another approach associated with a low risk for bleeding. If tranexamic acid is used, 10 mL of a 5% mouthwash solution can be given just before the procedure and two to three times daily for 1 to 2 days' post-procedure.

14.2 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The clinical evidence for the effectiveness of ELIQUIS is derived from the ADVANCE-1, ADVANCE-2, and ADVANCE-3 clinical trials in adult patients undergoing elective hip (ADVANCE-3) or knee (ADVANCE-2 and ADVANCE-1) replacement surgery. A total of 11,659 patients were randomized in 3 double-blind, multi-national studies. Included in this total were 1866 patients age 75 or older, 1161 patients with low body weight (≤ 60 kg), 2528 patients with Body Mass Index ≥ 33 kg/m2, and 625 patients with severe or moderate renal impairment.

In the ADVANCE-3 study, 5407 patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery were randomized to receive either ELIQUIS 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily. The first dose of ELIQUIS was given 12 to 24 hours post surgery, whereas enoxaparin was started 9 to 15 hours prior to surgery. Treatment duration was 32 to 38 days.

In patients undergoing elective knee replacement surgery, ELIQUIS 2.5 mg orally twice daily was compared to enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily (ADVANCE-2, N = 3057) or enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours (ADVANCE-1, N = 3195). In the ADVANCE-2 study, the first dose of ELIQUIS was given 12 to 24 hours postsurgery, whereas enoxaparin was started 9 to 15 hours prior to surgery. In the ADVANCE-1 study, both ELIQUIS and enoxaparin were initiated 12 to 24 hours post surgery. Treatment duration in both ADVANCE-2 and ADVANCE-1 was 10 to 14 days.

In all 3 studies, the primary endpoint was a composite of adjudicated asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT, nonfatal PE, and all-cause death at the end of the double-blind intended treatment period. In ADVANCE-3 and ADVANCE-2, the primary endpoint was tested for noninferiority, then superiority, of ELIQUIS to enoxaparin. In ADVANCE-1, the primary endpoint was tested for noninferiority of ELIQUIS to enoxaparin.

The efficacy data are provided in Tables 15 and 16.

The efficacy profile of ELIQUIS was generally consistent across subgroups of interest for this indication (e.g., age, gender, race, body weight, renal impairment).

### Perioperative management of apixaban in patients with advanced CKD undergoing a planned invasive procedure [^113nMNqR]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients in this study had significant renal dysfunction, with CrCl values well below those described in the PAUSE study. Most patients were receiving reduced-dose apixaban despite only two-thirds meeting criteria for dose reduction. Perioperative consultants often recommended apixaban dose reduction or rotation to a different anticoagulant. Preoperative interruption intervals in this study were similar for low- and high-bleed-risk procedures. Taken together, these findings suggest physicians were apprehensive about perioperative apixaban use in patients with advanced CKD and placed greater emphasis on kidney dysfunction than procedural bleed risk when deciding on an interruption interval.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective design with resulting potential for information bias, as well as a small sample size which leads to wide CIs and uncertainty surrounding risk estimates. Little information was available on residual apixaban levels, as few patients had a level drawn. Nonetheless, our findings provide preliminary but important data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD undergoing invasive procedures.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111GY8D9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^1138CPtm]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Discontinuation of oral anticoagulant treatment is common in clinical practice due to concerns about bleeding, even for procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Objective

To explore whether perioperative discontinuation of factor Xa inhibitors is associated with major bleeding and thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, multicenter, single-arm cohort study conducted in Korea included patients with AF who planned to undergo a procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk between September 25, 2020, and April 5, 2024.

Exposure

The PERIXa (Perioperative Factor Xa Inhibitor Discontinuation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Minimal to Low Bleed Risk Procedures) protocol recommending giving the last dose of factor Xa inhibitor (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) 24 hours before the procedure (ie, endoscopy, dental procedure, or ocular surgery) and restarting treatment with the inhibitor the next day.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was major bleeding, and the secondary outcome included a composite of thromboembolic events 30 days after the index procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Results

In total, 1902 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set encompassing all patients who underwent the intended procedure (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [8.8] years; 1135 [59.7%] male; mean [SD] CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex; range, 0–9, with higher scores indicating higher risk of stroke] score, 2.8 [1.3]; mean [SD] HAS-BLED [hypertension, kidney or liver disease, stroke history, prior bleeding, unstable international normalized ratio, age > 65 years, and drug or alcohol use; range, 0–9, with higher scores indicating higher risk of bleeding] score, 1.6 [0.7]). Among them, 921 (48.4%) were receiving apixaban, 616 (32.4%) were receiving edoxaban, and 365 (19.2%) were receiving rivaroxaban. Of the total procedures, 948 (49.8%) were endoscopy, 820 (43.1%) were dental procedures, and 120 (6.3%) were ocular surgery. The 30-day event rate of major bleeding was 0.1% (n = 2), and there were no composite thromboembolic events. The results were consistent in the per-protocol analysis, and no differences were observed by procedure category or factor Xa inhibitor type.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, patients with AF receiving a factor Xa inhibitor and undergoing a procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk had low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism when following the standardized PERIXa protocol for perioperative management of oral anticoagulant treatment, suggesting that this may be a safe and reasonable option for this patient population.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^115hZPcy]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Oversight

The PERIXa study was a multicenter, prospective, single-arm cohort study conducted at 29 sites in South Korea. The study rationale, detailed study design, and protocol are described elsewhere. Details regarding the participating centers and investigators are provided in Supplement 1. This study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). The institutional review board of each participating center approved the PERIXa study, and all participants provided written informed consent. This report followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

The PERIXa study focused on patients with AF who were being treated with factor Xa inhibitors and needed to interrupt anticoagulation therapy for elective procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Patients were allocated to 1 of 3 cohorts based on the type of procedure (endoscopy, dental, or ocular) and also classified into 3 groups according to the specific factor Xa inhibitor used (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban).

The EHRA offers a pragmatic guideline suggesting DOAC discontinuation 18 to 24 hours before an intervention and resumption 6 hours afterward, based on the DOAC half-life or elimination time. However, this recommendation lacks robust, large-scale clinical evidence. In the PERIXa study, we proposed and evaluated a more user-friendly protocol based on the EHRA guideline for DOAC discontinuation before and resumption after procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk defined by the ISTH Guidance Statement for the risk stratification for procedural bleeding risk. The procedures included in the PERIXa study align with the categories of minimal and low bleeding risk defined by the ISTH Guidance Statement and overlap with the minor-risk and low-risk interventions suggested by EHRA. These classifications are summarized in eAppendix 7 in Supplement 2. Our primary outcome was focused on major bleeding as defined by the ISTH.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy for preventing oral bleeding in people on anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions [^115kkJ3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals on continuous treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral or dental procedures. Anticoagulant treatment is preferably continued at the same dose, since dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The use of haemostatic measures during or after the procedure (or both) could enable continuation of the oral anticoagulant treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents for preventing bleeding complications in people on oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed using ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the CINAHL database of nursing and allied health services, the open access ProQuest dissertation database, papers and reports from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) and abstract books from annual scientific conferences. Date of last search: 04 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in people on continuous treatment with VKAs or DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid (TXA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid) to prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or usual care with or without placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained from potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based of the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardized forms. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

No eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures were identified. Three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial (follow-up in all was seven days) in people on continuous treatment with VKAs were included with a total of 253 participants (mean age 60 years). Two trials published in 1989 and 1993 compared the antifibrinolytic agent TXA with placebo in people using VKAs. Two other trials were published in 1999 and 2015 and compared TXA with gelatin sponge and sutures, and dry gauze compression, respectively. In all included trials, those who were treated with VKAs had international normalised ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic range and TXA was applied locally, not systemically. The two trials from 1989 and 1993 comparing TXA with placebo showed a statistically significant beneficial effect regarding the number of major postoperative bleeding episodes requiring intervention, with a pooled risk difference (RD) of -0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.36 to -0.14) (128 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). For the two trials that compared TXA with either gelatin sponge and sutures or with dry gauze compression, there was no difference between the TXA and the standard care group, RD 0.02 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.11) (125 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). The combined RD of all included trials was -0.13 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.05) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no side effects of antifibrinolytic therapy that required treatment withdrawal (128 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Despite heterogeneity between trials with respect to the different haemostatic measures used in the control groups, the trials were comparable regarding design and baseline participant characteristics. Overall, we considered the risk of bias to be low in the trials comparing TXA with placebo and moderate in the trials comparing TXA with alternative haemostatic measures.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the results of this Cochrane Review, there seems to be a beneficial effect of locally applied TXA in preventing oral bleeding in people on continuous treatment with VKAs undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. However, the small number of identified randomised controlled trials, the relatively small number of participants included in the trials and the differences in standard therapy and treatment regimens between trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in this population. We were unable to identify any eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures. Therefore, a beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic therapy can currently only be assumed based on data from the people using VKAs.

### Perioperative management of patients on new oral anticoagulants [^1151nDDJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer an alternative to warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. NOACs are expected to replace warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists for most of their indications in the future. Knowledge of the use of NOACs in the perioperative period is important for optimal care.

Methods

Studies that reported on the use of NOACs were identified, focusing on evidence-based guidance relating to the perioperative period. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and January 2014.

Results

The anticipated expanded clinical use of NOACs such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto™), apixaban (Eliquis™) and dabigatran (Pradaxa™) has the potential to simplify perioperative anticoagulant management because of fewer drug-drug interactions, rapid onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics and relatively short half-lives. However, coagulation status cannot be monitored by international normalized ratio and no antidotes are currently available. In elective surgery, it is important to discontinue the use of NOACs, with special consideration of renal function as route of elimination. Guidelines for the management of bleeding complications in patients on NOACs are provided, and may be considered for trauma and emergency surgery. Haemodialysis could be considered for bleeding with use of dabigatran. Better options for reversal of the effects of NOACs when bleeding occurs may follow with novel drugs.

Conclusion

Management of NOACs in elective and emergency conditions requires knowledge of time of last intake of drug, current renal function and the planned procedure in order to assess the overall risk of bleeding. Currently no antidote exists to reverse the effects of these drugs.

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: does low time in therapeutic range affect persistence? [^115upTnP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

The study obtained individual patient data from three large Dutch anticoagulation clinics (located in Amsterdam, Leiden, and Utrecht), which are managed by the Dutch Federation of Anticoagulation Clinics ("Federatie Nederlandse Trombosediensten" [FNT]). These clinics monitor the VKA therapy of patients living in well‐defined geographical areas. When enlisted by an anticoagulation clinic, several patient characteristics are registered, including date of birth, sex, co‐medication, indication for VKA treatment, the start and end date of VKA treatment, and therapeutic range of INR. To monitor INR, appointments are made at least once every 6 weeks. The time interval between INR measurements depends on the stability of the INR. At each appointment, a standardized short questionnaire is used (and electronically stored) to document changes in co‐medication, the onset of comorbidities, the occurrence of bleeding events, or scheduled invasive procedures (e.g. planned surgery or dental extractions). In the study, the data we obtained were extracted on June 19, 2020.

The data from the three anticoagulation clinics were then linked at an individual level to the nationwide individual data (available from 2010 to 2018) from Statistics Netherlands ("Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek" [CBS]). The gathering and linking of data by CBS have been described earlier, and to ensure privacy, all data were deidentified, and a unique artificial personal identifier was assigned to each linked individual. In brief, the following data were used in the study: (a) data on personal characteristics and socioeconomic status from the Personal Records Database; (b) diagnosis data as listed during hospital admission from the National Basic Register of Hospital Care of Dutch Hospital Data, which includes all general and academic Dutch hospitals and two short‐stay categorical hospitals (i.e. a cancer clinic and an eye hospital); (c) medication prescription data, for which the Dutch basic health insurance reimburses the costs (except for medication received in hospitals and nursing homes) collected from the Health Care Insurance Board. For VKA and DOAC prescription data, only the prescription dates and general types (i.e. DOAC or VKA) were available, while the amount of medication collected for each prescription, as well as DOAC or VKA subtypes were unavailable.

Surveys were administered from June to November 2021 at 2 academic medical centers, the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF). The UCLA Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol, with the UCSF relying on the UCLA Institutional Review Board.

Participants

Potential study participants receiving apixaban between August 2019 and August 2021 were identified via large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data extractions at each site and screened for eligibility. Those with email addresses were emailed an electronic Qualtrics survey link, while those without email addresses were mailed paper copies of the survey with a postage-paid return envelope. Nonrespondents received up to 3 to 5 reminders via emails/postal mailings and/or 1 telephone call. Respondents received a $25 gift card for survey completion.

Screening questions for study eligibility were completed by all respondents. Eligible patients were adults prescribed apixaban for AF or atrial flutter who reported "not taking Eliquis" or "sometimes" or "often" missing apixaban doses without a physician's recommendation. Only eligible patients were directed to the survey.

Reasons for nonadherence to apixaban

Pre-survey, we performed cognitive interviews with 10 patients to test the comprehensibility, mutual exclusiveness, and adequate representation of questions and response options regarding reasons for patient nonadherence. Questions were iteratively refined based on patient feedback. On the final survey, questions regarding the reasons for patient nonadherence asked patients to select both the most important reason and all applicable responses from a list of 10 potential reasons for nonadherence to apixaban. Patients were also given an option to check 'other' and write-in reason(s).

Cost-related nonadherence was assessed using questions modified from an existing validated 3-item measure. Patients were asked whether they "skipped apixaban (Eliquis) doses", "have taken less apixaban (Eliquis)", or "delayed filling apixaban (Eliquis)" to save money during the last 12 months. Any "yes" response indicated cost-related nonadherence.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — observational data guiding interruption before high-bleeding-risk procedures: In dabigatran-treated patients at high bleeding risk, the last dose was to be taken 3 days (minimum 60–72 hours) preprocedure, and no detectable anticoagulant effect (ie, a plasma level < 20 ng/mL) by dTT was found in 95.5% at the time of the procedure; among 422 patients with CrCl > 50 mL/min, a 49–72 hours discontinuation resulted in apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran plasma levels > 30 ng/mL in only 5% of patients; for dabigatran with CrCl 30–50 mL/min, 4–5 days would be needed to ensure a minimal anticoagulant effect during a high bleeding risk procedure.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^116Ywy1q]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently under way to answer these questions. Because the half lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents. Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision making and suggest strategies to minimize complications. From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding risks and benefits of treatment options and demonstration of effective communication among medical and surgical providers are essential.

ASIPP 2024 — Timing of anticoagulant interruption and restart for surgery is outlined as follows: Recommendations state aspirin is continued for all types of surgeries, and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are stopped for 24 h before minor surgery and 48 h before major surgery, while clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) are held for 5–7 days. Table-based examples specify drug-specific withholding and restart intervals: Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin) and 48–72 h after major surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin); Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h, withhold 24 h for minor and 48 h for major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h uses creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide withholding (CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 24 h for minor, 72 h for major; CrCl < 50 mL: 75 h for minor, 120 h for major) and restart 24 h after minor or 24–48 h after major surgery; Aspirin half-life 7–10 days is "usually continued" and "usually continued" for restart; Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days, withhold 5–7 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery. In case of impaired renal function, withholding intervals for several agents should be prolonged and/or drug levels evaluated.

### Apixaban [^114jSMR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Apixaban tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and rarely may lead to death. This is because apixaban tablets are a blood thinner medicine that reduces blood clotting.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take apixaban tablets and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

- aspirin or aspirin-containing products

- long-term (chronic) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- warfarin sodium (COUMADIN®, JANTOVEN®)

- any medicine that contains heparin

- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- other medicines to help prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

While taking apixaban tablets:

- you may bruise more easily

- it may take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop

Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding when taking apixaban tablets:

- **Unexpected bleeding, or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as**:

- unusual bleeding from the gums

- nosebleeds that happen often

- menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

- bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

- red, pink, or brown urine

- red or black stools (looks like tar)

- cough up blood or blood clots

- vomit blood or your vomit looks like coffee grounds

- unexpected pain, swelling, or joint pain

- headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

- Apixaban tablets are not for patients with artificial heart valves.
- Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like apixaban tablets, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure. If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y.

12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. For dual-antiplatelet therapy post stent placement, management depends on the time since stent placement. If the patient is within 12 weeks postcoronary stenting, either delaying elective surgery or continuing both medications is recommended because of the high risk of stent thrombosis. For patients who are more than three months after coronary stent placement, the recommendation is to stop the P2Y. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy. Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes.

Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing interventional procedures (preprocedural discontinuation of anticoagulant agents), ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for 2 days for high-risk procedures and 1 day for intermediate-risk procedures. Adjust interruption to 2 days and 3–4 days for dabigatran with CrCl < 50 mL/minute. Consider continuing direct oral coagulants for low-risk procedures. Consuder continuing DOACs for intermediate-risk procedures in patients with normal renal function, based on clinical condition and importance.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

2.1 Recommended Dose in Adult Patients

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.
In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dose in Pediatric Patients

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE in Pediatric Patients

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is based on the patient's weight, see Table 1. Adjust the dose according to weight-tier as treatment progresses. Initiate ELIQUIS treatment for pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age following at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation therapy. Individualize duration of overall therapy after careful assessment of the treatment benefit and the risk for bleeding.

Table 1: Dose Recommendation in Pediatric Patients from Birth to less than 18 Years of Age for the Treatment of VTE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE

ELIQUIS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2.6 kg because ELIQUIS was not studied in these patients.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose of ELIQUIS is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

### Dental surgery during continuous anticoagulant therapy… [^115wBWot]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Dental surgery can be performed safely while patients are on anticoagulant therapy. Twenty patients on long-term anticoagulant therapy underwent 45 surgical procedures in a department of oral surgery. The procedures included extractions, "open" or "surgical" operations, alveolotomies, removal of chronic inflamed tissue, drainage of abscess, and insertion of Behrman magnetic implants. There was no incidence of unusual or serious hemorrhage. It is suggested that for surgery the anticoagulant therapy be held in the low optimal range, as for example, 22 to 25 seconds with a normal of 15 seconds. The recommended surgical technique is included in this article. Behrman SJ, Wright IS. Dental Surgery During Continuous Anticoagulant Therapy.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111vkUs8]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) — standardized interruption schedules and outcomes are reported as follows: A prospective management study of 541 dabigatran-treated patients adopted 24- and 48-hour interruption intervals for low- and high-bleed-risk surgeries/procedures, respectively, with low 30-day post-operative rates of ATE 0.2% and major bleeding 1.8%. In the PAUSE prospective management study of 3,007 atrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban, those with severe renal insufficiency were excluded (CrCl < 25 mL/min for apixaban; CrCl < 30 mL/min for dabigatran or rivaroxaban); DOACs were interrupted for 1 day before and 1 day after low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedures and for 2 days before and 2 days after high-bleed-risk procedures, with an exception for 2.7% [80 of 3,007] of dabigatran patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min whose interruption was extended by 1 or 2 days; 30-day postoperative incidences of ATE and major bleeding were 0.16% and 1.35% in apixaban (n = 1,257), 0.60% and 0.9% in dabigatran (n = 668), and 0.37% and 1.85% in rivaroxaban (n = 1,082).

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^112TtCuJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For patients receiving ELIQUIS 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose of ELIQUIS should be decreased by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For patients receiving ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant administration of combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients.

Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Concomitant use with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] which increases the risk for bleeding.

Clarithromycin

Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary with concomitant administration with ELIQUIS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Concomitant use with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] which increases the risk for stroke and other thromboembolic events.

Table 1.
Perioperative management, kidney function and dialysis status

Figure 1.
Perioperative apixaban management in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Apixaban interruption and resumption intervals in hours, stratified according to procedural bleed risk. Intervals represent the time between last dose of apixaban before the procedure and the procedure itself, approximated to the nearest 12 hours. Apixaban was not resumed after the procedure for 1 patient undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure and 4 patients undergoing high-bleed-risk procedures. The median interruption and resumption intervals for patients undergoing low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 24 hours (IQR 24–48), respectively. The median interruption and resumption intervals for high-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 48 hours (IQR 24–72), respectively. Interruption intervals were not significantly different according to procedural bleed risk (P = 0.38), but patients who had undergone a high-bleed-risk procedure had significantly longer resumption intervals (P = 0.0037).

We present novel data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD who underwent a planned invasive procedure. Interruptions were over twice as long for patients undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure as compared with a recent perioperative DOAC management study (84 hours vs ∼39 hours, PAUSE study), and longer than guideline-recommended intervals. This could have been due to perceived delayed apixaban clearance in patients with kidney dysfunction. As expected, patients with CKD were at risk of bleeding complications on anticoagulation. On the other hand, we observed only 2 MB events felt to be directly related to surgery (3.3%), corresponding to a risk of MB similar to that observed among warfarin- or DOAC-treated patients when best practices are followed (∼ 1%-3%). We did not observe any postoperative ATE or VTE. The interruption intervals observed in this study equate to holding apixaban for 1 to 2 additional days before a procedure compared to guideline-recommended practice. Our results, although preliminary, are reassuring and seem to indicate that planned procedures can be undertaken in this patient population without undue risk of bleeding or thrombosis, provided anticoagulation is managed carefully.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose of ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of ELIQUIS overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — bridging therapy during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic heart valves: For patients with mechanical heart valves who are undergoing minor procedures (eg, dental extractions or cataract removal) where bleeding is easily controlled, continuation of VKA anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR is recommended. For patients with a bileaflet mechanical AVR and no other risk factors for thromboembolism who are undergoing invasive procedures, temporary interruption of VKA anticoagulation, without bridging agents while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended. For patients with a mechanical prosthesis receiving VKA therapy who require immediate/ emergency noncardiac surgery or an invasive procedure, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (or its activated form) is reasonable. For patients with bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings who are receiving anticoagulant therapy for AF, it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around the time of invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against the risk of bleeding. For patients who are undergoing invasive procedures and have 1) a mechanical AVR and any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the INR is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis, with the risk of bleeding weighed against the benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) — The BRIDGE trial randomized 1884 patients with AF or AFL to bridging anticoagulation before and after the procedure with dalteparin versus placebo, and no bridging was superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding and was noninferior with respect to thromboembolism, with the observed rate (0.4%) lower than anticipated (1.0%). Almost 90% of patients were undergoing low bleeding risk procedures. In PERIOP2, 79% had AF and patients were randomized to postoperative bridging with dalteparin or placebo until the INR was > 1.9; all patients received preoperative bridging, and bleeding and thromboembolism outcomes were similar. Additional studies reported dental extractions performed on uninterrupted warfarin without bridging and a large multicenter registry found no difference in thromboembolism but an increase in bleeding in bridged patients.

### Effects of direct oral anticoagulants on quality of life during periprocedural management for dental extractions [^116rCcJ8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have many advantages over warfarin regarding periprocedural management for dental extractions. They avoid the need to assess and possibly adjust warfarin therapy to achieve appropriate hemostatic status before and after extraction. The present study evaluated the real-life data regarding quality of life (QoL) and burden for patients with atrial fibrillation receiving long-term treatment with warfarin or DOACs during periprocedural management for dental extraction.

Patients and Methods

We implemented a multicenter study. The sample was composed of 205 patients who had been receiving long-term anticoagulation treatment with warfarin (n = 133) or DOACs (n = 72). The Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) was used to assess the QoL. Periprocedural management for dental extraction was recorded using the questions designed by us.

Results

Warfarin created a significantly greater burden for patients during periprocedural management for dental extraction compared with DOACs. The DASS results showed that the QoL of patients was significantly better for the DOAC group than for the warfarin group (score, 75.19 ± 18.52 and 90.12 ± 17.28, respectively; p = 0.0001). Of the patients in the DOAC group, 45 had used warfarin as their previous therapy and had undergone another tooth extraction while using warfarin. Of these patients, 91.1% chose DOACs as their anticoagulant of choice for dental extraction.

Conclusion

The present findings suggest that DOACs have many advantages compared with warfarin regarding the reported QoL and periprocedural management of dental extraction.

### Novel oral anticoagulants in plastic surgery [^112cgsWG]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have emerged as a good alternative to warfarin in the prevention of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation. NOAC use is increasing rapidly; therefore, greater understanding of their use in the perioperative period is important for optimal care. Studies and reviews that reported on the use of NOACs were identified, with particular focus on the perioperative period. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and August 2015. The inevitable rise in the use of NOACs such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto™), apixaban (Eliquis™), edoxaban (Lixiana™) and dabigatran (Pradaxa™) may present a simplified approach to perioperative anticoagulant management due to fewer drug interactions, rapidity of onset of action and relatively short half-lives. Coagulation status, however, cannot reliably be monitored and no antidotes are currently available. When planning for discontinuation of NOACs, special consideration of renal function is required. Advice regarding the management of bleeding complications is provided for consideration in emergency surgery. In extreme circumstances, haemodialysis may be considered for bleeding with the use of dabigatran. NOACs will increasingly affect operative planning in plastic surgery. In order to reduce the incidence of complications associated with anticoagulation, the management of NOACs in the perioperative period requires knowledge of the time of last dose, renal function and the bleeding risk of the planned procedure. Consideration of these factors will allow appropriate interpretation of the current guidelines.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on DOACs, ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for 2 days for high-risk procedures and 1 day for intermediate-risk procedures. Adjust interruption to 2 days and 3–4 days for dabigatran with CrCl < 50 mL/minute. Consider continuing direct oral coagulants for low-risk procedures. Consuder continuing DOACs for intermediate-risk procedures in patients with normal renal function, based on clinical condition and importance.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):
- **AIS**: use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.
- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^113TxacP]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Smaller studies suggest reduced bleeding risk when anticoagulation is discontinued rather than continued without significantly increasing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. Subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials — comparing the efficacy and safety of 4 DOACs to warfarin — provided insights into periprocedural management strategies for DOACs, reaching similar conclusions. These subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials had limitations: few patients underwent scheduled procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, and there were no standardized protocols for DOAC discontinuation. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that temporarily stopping DOAC administration during the periprocedural period may lower the risk of major bleeding without substantially increasing thromboembolic events.,

Prospective studies have evaluated periprocedural management of DOACs, including a meta-analysis comparing DOACs with warfarin in elective procedures under a noninterruption or short interruption strategy. This analysis demonstrated a 38% lower risk of major bleeding with DOAC treatment under a noninterruption strategy, with no differences observed under an interrupted strategy while maintaining comparable efficacy in stroke prevention and overall mortality. However, no prospective studies have focused on procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. The PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation) trial was the largest multicenter, multinational clinical study using a 1-arm design with a well-defined periprocedural DOAC management protocol for 3007 patients with AF undergoing procedures with high and low to moderate bleeding risk. The PAUSE trial found endoscopic procedures comprised 20.9% of total procedures, with ocular and dental procedures at 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Other studies, and a registryreported that endoscopic procedures comprised 19.9% to 34.9% of the total procedures, while ocular or dental procedures accounted for only 3.9% to 13.4%. Although the PAUSE trialfound very low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism (major bleeding rates of 0.9%-1.9% and stroke or thromboembolism rates of 0.2%-0.6% at 30 days after the procedure), with other studies reporting similar event rates, there was a small proportion of procedures with minimal bleeding risk included. The PERIXa study aligns with and expands on the findings of the PAUSE study in periprocedural DOAC management. The present study used data from a large multicenter study with a well-defined interruption protocol for factor Xa inhibitors in patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Discussion

In this prospective, multicenter cohort study of patients with AF who were receiving factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulation treatment and undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, the PERIXa protocol for factor Xa inhibitor interruption and resumption was associated with a low 30-day major bleeding event rate (0.1%) and no thromboembolic events (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Among 1902 patients included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set, there were 2 (0.1%) major bleeding events, 8 (0.4%) CRNMB, 43 (2.3%) minor bleeding, and 50 (2.6%) all bleeding events that occurred.

Dental procedures had the highest incidence of bleeding events among the 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Bleeding event rates were not significantly different across various types of DOACs (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) or dosing regimens (once or twice daily). Periprocedural protocol adherence was 84.9%. The per-protocol analysis corroborated the main findings.

The EHRA practical guidelines advise against discontinuing OACs for scheduled procedures with minor bleeding risk, recommending that they be performed 12 to 24 hours after the last DOAC dose. However, a more practical clinical approach may involve administering the final DOAC dose 18 to 24 hours before the procedure and resuming it 6 hours after. An inconsistency exists between this general guideline and specific practical guidelines that suggest single-dose discontinuation based on the DOAC type, such as apixaban or dabigatran. Furthermore, there is a lack of prospective evidence supporting this recommendation. The American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline for perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy published in 2022recommended continuing anticoagulation treatment for procedures with minimal bleeding risk with no or only minimal interruption (ie, on the day of the procedure). For procedures with low to moderate bleeding risk, they advise pausing 1 day before the operation and resuming DOACs at least 24 hours after the procedure. However, this guideline did not offer unified recommendations for endoscopy, dental, or ocular procedures, categorized as interventions with minor bleeding risk in the EHRA guideline. While there is limited research supporting recommendations for procedures with minimal bleeding risk, our PERIXa study provides substantial observational evidence supporting the perioperative discontinuation of factor Xa inhibitors in a large prospective cohort.
