## Question

soap note cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a SOAP note for cystitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the SOAP structure and how to apply it to cystitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach for acute uncomplicated cystitis versus recurrent or complicated presentations. Next, I will review objective testing thresholds and when to culture. After that, I need to check treatment choices, durations, and stewardship. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and documentation best practices, ensuring each element is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the SOAP framework and its purpose. SOAP organizes notes into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, which improves clarity, communication, and medicolegal safety; I should ensure each section is concise, relevant, and avoids copying redundant data from the EHR, aligning with pediatric documentation guidance and quality improvement literature that shows structured notes reduce errors and improve care coordination [^113WK5wq] [^113twkBa].

> Now, for the Subjective section, I need to capture the core lower urinary tract symptoms and their chronology. Typical features include dysuria, frequency, urgency, and sometimes hematuria; I should confirm the absence of vaginal discharge to support a urinary rather than vaginal source, and I should ask about fever, flank pain, immunocompromise, diabetes, pregnancy, recent sexual activity, and prior UTIs to risk-stratify for complicated disease or recurrence; in women with recurrent UTIs, I should document the number of episodes in 6–12 months and any prior culture results to anchor diagnosis and guide testing [^11697iDy] [^111rAs3W] [^1175RXfj].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold for uncomplicated cystitis. In nonpregnant, immunocompetent women with classic symptoms and no vaginal discharge, empiric treatment without culture is acceptable; however, I should obtain urinalysis when presentation is atypical, in recurrent UTI, in patients ≥ 65, in pregnancy, or when treatment fails, and I should culture when there is treatment failure, suspected resistance, atypical features, or in pregnancy, because these scenarios change management and stewardship needs [^111rAs3W] [^116RajvE] [^117ARgks].

> For the Objective section, I will now examine vitals and a focused exam, and I should double-check urine testing choices. Vitals should screen for fever or hemodynamic instability; the abdomen should be soft, nontender without costovertebral angle tenderness; a pelvic exam is not routinely needed for uncomplicated cystitis but may be considered if vaginal symptoms or discharge are present; I should obtain a urinalysis with dipstick for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and microscopy for pyuria, recognizing that pyuria supports infection but absence of pyuria argues against UTI in symptomatic women with bacteriuria; I should send a urine culture with susceptibilities if the patient is pregnant, has recurrent UTI, is ≥ 65, has atypical symptoms, or if treatment fails, because this guides targeted therapy and reduces resistance [^114CWdeL] [^112tRjeX] [^116RajvE].

> Hold on, I should verify the Assessment phrasing. For uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis, I will document the diagnosis and explicitly note the absence of features suggesting pyelonephritis or complicated UTI; if the patient meets criteria for recurrent UTI, I should define it as ≥ 2 symptomatic episodes in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months with at least one culture-proven infection, and I should document the evidence base for infection including pyuria and uropathogens during symptomatic episodes to avoid misclassification and overtreatment [^1175RXfj] [^112tRjeX].

> Next, I should review the Plan and ensure antibiotic choices align with stewardship. First-line options for uncomplicated cystitis include nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days if local resistance is ≤ 20%, or fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose; I should avoid fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist due to collateral damage and reserve them for resistance-driven needs; I should avoid amoxicillin or ampicillin empirically given resistance; I should provide analgesia with acetaminophen or NSAIDs; and I should counsel on expected course, red flags, and the need to return if fever, flank pain, or vomiting develop [^1122cGCL] [^116tgw7z] [^114jroXT].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has risk factors for complicated UTI. In pregnancy, I should confirm the diagnosis with culture and treat for 5–7 days with beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or fosfomycin, avoiding TMP-SMX near term and nitrofurantoin at term; in men, I should obtain culture and treat for 7–14 days given higher risk of prostatitis; in patients with ESBL-E cystitis, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible; for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales cystitis, meropenem is preferred if susceptible, with colistin as an alternative when appropriate; I should also remember not to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^114a81wN] [^11648bmi] [^116FqNn6] [^116ekh2D].

> I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed. For recurrent UTI, I should document each symptomatic episode with urinalysis and culture when feasible, consider nonantibiotic strategies such as behavioral modifications, and discuss prophylaxis options if indicated; for febrile UTI in children, I should arrange renal and bladder ultrasound and consider VCUG or DMSA based on age, recurrence, and ultrasound findings; for adults with recurrent UTIs, I should reassess risk factors, consider suppressive therapy, and reinforce hygiene and hydration strategies while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics [^113gEoge] [^113ugj5F] [^1139XM6y] [^111JQA8W].

> Let me reconsider documentation quality to avoid common pitfalls. I should avoid copying and pasting prior notes and instead document only what is new and necessary; I should be explicit about the rationale for empiric therapy versus culture-directed treatment; I should record the exact antibiotic, dose, duration, and indication; and I should note patient education and return precautions, because structured, problem-oriented notes improve safety, billing accuracy, and medicolegal defensibility [^113WK5wq] [^113twkBa].

> Finally, I should double-check that my SOAP example remains concise and reference-aligned. A practical note might read: Subjective: 28-year-old woman with 2-day history of dysuria, frequency, and urgency, no fever, flank pain, or vaginal discharge, one prior UTI 6 months ago; Objective: afebrile, nontender abdomen, no CVA tenderness, urinalysis positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrites with 10–50 WBC/hpf; Assessment: acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis; Plan: nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, acetaminophen as needed, return if fever, flank pain, or vomiting, and consider culture if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours or recur within 4 weeks [^111rAs3W] [^1122cGCL] [^117ARgks].

A SOAP note for cystitis should document **typical LUTS** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain) [^11697iDy] and exclude vaginal discharge or systemic features to support an uncomplicated diagnosis [^111rAs3W]. Objective findings include **positive urinalysis** (leukocyte esterase, nitrites, pyuria) [^114CWdeL] and, when indicated, urine culture to confirm the pathogen and guide therapy [^116RajvE]. Assessment should state "acute uncomplicated cystitis" and note any risk factors for complicated infection. The plan should include **first-line therapy** (nitrofurantoin 5 days, TMP-SMX 3 days, or fosfomycin single dose) [^1122cGCL] [^116tgw7z], analgesia, and patient education on adherence, hydration, and follow-up if symptoms persist or recur [^114jroXT].

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114XF3PN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Electronic documentation in pediatrics: the rationale and functionality requirements [^113WK5wq]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric electronic documentation — SOAP note guidance, safety considerations, and educational impact are outlined: Documentation standards should include recommendations regarding electronic documentation functionalities (copy and paste, copy and forward, automated insertion), and misuse can result in inaccurate, outdated, or irrelevant information with potential quality and liability consequences. For copying and pasting, "the Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety made 4 recommendations that could improve the safety of its use: making copied and pasted text readily identifiable, referencing the text's origin, providing education on its safe use, and having practices in place to monitor its use". SOAP note guidance emphasizes succinct, original, accurate, problem-based notes with explicit directives including "Document only what you must to support patient care, accurate billing, and other newly defined minimum standards. Be specific"., "Do not repeat or copy what is already available in the record (data and/or other notes)"., "Include only relevant patient data that is are accurate and timely"., and "Evolve to a problem-oriented medical record". The goal "should be complying with billing, coding, and payer guidelines and providing data for quality reporting programs but also following best practices for electronic documentation". In medical education, "The EHR is an essential part of the daily work of medical students" and "Medical interns are estimated to spend 40% of their time dealing with EHR systems".

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) initial evaluation — history, examination, and labs should be documented as follows: The number of voids per day, urge to void, and pain characteristics "should be documented", and dyspareunia, dysuria, ejaculatory pain, and menstrual relation "should also be noted". The physical examination "should include an abdominal and pelvic examination", pelvic floor muscles "should be palpated", and pelvic support "should be documented", with a focused evaluation to rule out alternative sources of pain or infection. A brief neurologic exam and assessment for incomplete bladder emptying "should be done on all patients". Basic laboratory evaluation "includes a urinalysis and urine culture", a hematuria workup "should be performed" for unevaluated hematuria and "considered" with tobacco exposure, and urine culture "may be indicated even in patients with a negative urinalysis".

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^116wGCsY]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Measures

We calculated the notes expected to be filled under SOAP format during the 24 hours of a patient's stay and identified them as eligible notes. One note, each from the day and the night shift, that is, two out of four notes constituted eligible notes.

We studied ward-round notes wherein 'all' four headings of the SOAP template were used. Our consultant also studied whether information conveyed against each heading was appropriate and relevant to it. Our outcome measure was the percentage of notes written in SOAP format. Our primary process measure was compliance with the acronym on ward-round case sheets. We also monitored our compliance to our subsequent change idea in which we used visual prompters on the department information board. Our balancing measures were paediatrician and patient feedback during the implementation of the SOAP acronym.

Analysis

The outcome of the project was analysed using standard run charts which identified statistical significance in the outcome measure assessed on a regular basis. Based on run-chart rules proposed by Anhøj and Olesen, we saw a shift in the run on one side of the median, so we revised and calculated a new median. Also, towards the end of every cycle we collected team feedback using group discussions, focusing on the 'specific' intervention to learn team experiences and sentiments.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|
|Non-low risk, first option|- Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis|
|Non-low risk, second option|- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis < br > - Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture if urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria) < br > - Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.|

### How do patients with interstitial cystitis present? [^1162cZK1]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined how interstitial cystitis progresses from initial symptoms to diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 45 patients to determine the dates of symptom onset and diagnosis, and sequence of urgency/frequency, nocturia and pain. We also documented alternate and previous diagnoses, and previous surgical treatments.

Results

Of the patients 89% presented with only 1 symptom. Median time from the initial symptom to all symptoms was 2 years (mean 5.5). The most common previous diagnoses were urinary infection in 19 cases, a gynecologic diagnosis in 14 and urethral diagnoses in 6. A previous urinary infection was documented in only 1 of 19 patients, while 11 had undergone hysterectomy and 5 diagnosed with endometriosis had no pathological documentation available.

Conclusions

Early interstitial cystitis presents variably and usually with only a single symptom of urgency/frequency, nocturia or pain. Clinicians may fail to appreciate the symptoms of early interstitial cystitis, which leads to delayed diagnosis until the patient is more symptomatic. With time multiple symptoms manifest. Bacterial cystitis, prostatitis, endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain are common initial misdiagnoses. Interstitial cystitis should be considered when laboratory documentation of alternate diagnoses is lacking or when patients fail to respond to therapy for alternate diagnoses.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^113twkBa]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Available knowledge

Well-written case notes provide accountability, corroborate the delivery of appropriate services, support clinical decisions, promote effective communication and prevent patient harm. Inadequate communication between different health professionals is associated with discontinuity of care, which can lead to errors and compromise patient safety. In present times, clinical notes also serve as a valuable document to audit the quality of healthcare services offered, determine issuance of insurance claims and, importantly, serve as a documentary evidence for medicolegal purpose.

Despite its importance, clinical record keeping is often given a low priority, and it is common to find missing information and inconsistency between the entries. Often, there is great variability in the format of clinical notes among different healthcare professionals and hospitals in different countries. These may be influenced by the doctor's/healthcare professional's years of experience, previous incidents (i.e. lessons that have been learnt) and relevant circumstances of the case (acute deterioration of the patient, etc). In densely populated nations such as ours, an additional role is played by limited consult times from enormous caseloads, resulting in priority towards clinical interaction over documentation.

The onus for improving records lies with individual health professionals. Structuring the clinical records especially at the time of admission is known to improve the quality of information recorded. This reduces clinical errors and improves patient outcomes. In the same context, ward-round proforma or templates have been employed to standardise recording of patient progress. This has demonstrated an improvement in documentation practices, patient safety, efficiency in ward roundsas well as completeness of records. These proformas have been typically designed to capture comprehensive information pertaining to a particular specialty (eg, surgery or orthopaedics) or a disease (eg, deep venous thromboembolism).

Another method commonly applied to improve documentation practices has been audit exercises to sensitise doctors regarding their performance. This includes educating them via trainings or reminder communications to perform against a benchmark. These audits engage either a concerned specialty centric template (eg, Shark, Crabel, Star, to name a few)or adhere to norms defined by quality accreditation programmes.

Both proforma as well as audit templates have focused on comprehensive aspects of record keeping such as investigations, drug prescription, information to patients, date and time of records, and regularity besides characteristics of the clinical information. There appears to be a paucity of literature demonstrating methods focused only on the nature of the clinical information relayed in the note.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^113jwcEH]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Electronic medical records use standardised templates, which guide specific entries. As compilation of records on blank sheets permits individual preferences for compilation, it risks selective and deficient entries.

Ward-round notes in our hospital, like most healthcare facilities in India, are maintained on paper. Hospital case files are composed of several paper sheets which are assembled in a uniform order throughout the hospital. Some of these sheets carry preprinted templates and some are blank, but each sheet is assigned and labelled for a specific purpose. Our hospital is accredited under the National Accreditation Board for Hospital certification, and case records are regularly subject to detailed audits which assess adherence towards exhaustive record-keeping practices including date and time of the notes, regularity, legibility, patient medication details, investigation details, nursing records, pain score, etc. These audits, however, do not reflect evaluation of the content within the notes, whose inconsistency and selective filling were our prime concern.

Rationale

Recognising our need to structure our notes, we explored the methodology used by Dolan et al, i.e. structuring of the records incorporating the subjective, objective, assessment and planning (SOAP) template. The SOAP acronym is a derivative of problem-oriented medical record practice, which warrants that clinical records be structured around the patient's problems and updated in detail on a daily basis.SOAP prototype provides the cognitive framework for clinical reasoning while serving as a reminder for specific aspects of clinical information. A progress note under this format reflected essential parameters of ongoing patient progress and treatment information. We inferred from the available literature that structuring our notes will improve information recorded and thereby quality of documentation.

It was felt that SOAP format was suited to our system for two reasons. First, it served our requirement to balance out the neglected clinical parameters and save us from the implementation of exhaustive notes which could prove labour and time intensive for a busy system like ours. Second, its simple design circumvented the need for detailed department specific proforma, which would have required multiple approvals as well as institution-wide reforms around creation of distinct case files for different departments.

Aim

Our Specific, measurable, applicable, realistic and timely (SMART) aim was to improve the quality of documentation in ward-round notes, for paediatric inpatients aged between 1 month and 15 years, by application of the SOAP template to at least 80% of the eligible notes by 6 months. Eligible notes constituted two out of all the ward-round notes written during 24 hours of an inpatient stay.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### Impact of mandatory indications for outpatient antibiotic orders on accurate tracking of antibiotic indications [^115Kudcx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, both antibiotic appropriateness and congruence between ICD10 code and charted diagnoses increased in the post-implementation group compared to the pre-implementation group. This may be explained by the concept of accountable justification where providers are asked to document a justification for each prescription and are therefore more likely to preserve their professional reputation by acting in line with injunctive norms and recommended clinical guidelines. – Although not directly asked to justify the antibiotic choice and indication, by having to choose the associated indication, the provider, is in effect, having to justify that prescription.

Despite the effect of accountable justification, we found a high percent of inappropriate antibiotic choice in both the pre- and post-implementation groups (37% and 32%, respectively). These findings were consistent with previously published literature where 14.4%–49% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were inappropriate.– However, implementation of mandatory indications was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the post-implementation group. The main reason for inappropriate prescriptions was due to a high degree of failure to follow both national guidelines and local guidance. It is particularly challenging to counter national guidelines when they may not provide the best treatment based on local antibiograms, despite existence of local guidance documents, due to the ready availability of national resources. For example, at our institution, cephalexin has good susceptibility against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has good bioavailability, and gets adequate penetration into the urine to effectively treat cystitis, making cephalexin a good choice for simple cystitis. However, national guidelines list cephalexin as a less well-studied choice compared to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin due to lack of data. Notably, UTI guidelines are pending a new update and there has been subsequent literature to support use of cephalexin for uncomplicated UTI. – Dissemination of updated evidence and implementation into practice is often delayed.

### Patient related outcomes for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome recommendations for clinical trials and general urology practice [^116WEZ93]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Primary Endpoint Outcomes for Clinical Studies/Trials

The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain is the most accepted and used measure to describe pain at baseline and during follow up in clinical pain trials. This 11‐point measure should be strongly considered as a primary outcome in clinical trials of IC/BPS treatments. The severity of pain can be described as a point in time, average or maximum pain over a predetermined time period (suggested mean maximum or worse pain over a minimum of 3 days for each trial assessment interval). This single patient's rating of pain can be considered a PRO, but its major limitation is that it is not specific to IC/BPS. A patient with IC/BPS has multi‐dimensional pain experience as part of the clinical experience.

Voiding diaries (frequency volume charting) should be strongly considered as a primary outcome in clinical trials of IC/BPS. The consensus is to evaluate 3 separate days for an individual outcome measurement assessment. Items of relevance for IC/BPS are (per 24 h); urinary frequency, urgency and voided volumes. It is important to know that urgency experienced by IC/BPS has another dimension compared to OAB patients – typically a gradually increasing pain or discomfort during bladder filling, leading to more frequent voiding to prevent such pain. Also of note is the variations between IC/BPS patients in storage and voiding behavior can depend on availability of toilets, activities (pre‐emptive voiding before recreation, work, social activities) and fluid intake as well as individual pain avoidance voiding patterns.

The FDA‐BRUDAC committee has suggested that co‐primary outcomes should be considered in clinical trials. However, an analysis from the Multi‐Disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network points out that pain and urinary symptoms should be assessed separately rather than combined in a single score. The same might prove true using pain and urinary scores as a co‐primary outcome.

A 7‐point Global Response Assessment (GRA) has been employed as a primary endpoint, co‐primary endpoint and as a secondary endpoint in published clinical trials. Patients self‐report their perception of their clinical condition relative to baseline. The GRA assesses the patient's overall perception of difference in bladder pain and urinary symptoms (equal number of positive and negative choices) without identifying specific symptoms. Responders for the GRA were typically defined as subjects reporting that they were "markedly improved" or "moderately improved" compared with baseline.

- relative risks and benefits of available treatments

- the fact that no single treatment has been found effective for the majority of patients

- the fact that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options, including combination therapy.

4.6 Limitations

The committee recognizes limitations related to individual committee members' personal bias, the inherent lack of outcome reliability studies and the lack of a gold standard comparison for the various outcomes. The methodology did not employ a systematic review and rating of the evidence as required by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, but rather a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature based on expertise, experience and expert group consensus feedback. The role of cystoscopy, urodynamics, and pain mapping (considered by some as possible non‐PRO outcomes) has been addressed by the Diagnosis and Phenotype IC/BPS consensus meeting committees and have not been addressed by this PRO committee. The impact of trial design (inclusion/exclusion criteria) on research outcomes are also beyond the scope of this committee.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^111unxWW]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Results

Most general practitioners recruited few patients, citing lack of time as the major reason. Of those patients invited, most accepted, and there was no difference in characteristics of this patient group with those in other observational studies. There were no important differences by management group for the key baseline variables of age, symptom severity, past cystitis, somatic symptom inventory, and comorbidities (table 1). Although marital status did differ slightly by group, inclusion of this factor in the models did not confound the estimates.

There were also differences in the number where dipstick results were documented (immediate antibiotics 50% (33/66), midstream urine 52% (28/54), dipstick 95% (55/58), symptom score 55% (38/69), delayed antibiotics 29% (18/62); χ² = 55; P < 0.001). Including these variables in the models (that is, whether or not a midstream urine sample was sent or a dipstick result documented) did not alter the estimates of the main outcomes.

Diagnosis — women with frequent UTI may experience diagnostic delay if clinicians do not review the UTI history; clinicians should order pretreatment urine cultures to document rUTI (culture-proven UTI ≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months), and although infrequent UTI can be assessed with less rigor and treated empirically, women with frequent UTI who are being formally assessed for rUTI should have detailed symptom assessment and pretreatment urine culture and sensitivity.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1126bonT]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^111zyDyd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1168uduo]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evidence strength determination and study quality — grading and assessment approach: The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies; AUA categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A (well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies), Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies), or Grade C (observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data). Quality of individual RCTs or crossover trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and because placebo effects are common, procedural deviations that could compromise randomization or blinding resulted in a rating of increased risk of bias; the quality of individual observational studies was not assessed. Because treatment data are difficult to interpret without placebo control, bodies of evidence entirely lacking placebo controls were assigned a strength rating of Grade C.

3 Results

The literature search identified multiple PROs, PROMs, questionnaires and outcomes that have been used in research studies and clinical practice. A summary of the most used outcome measures including description, validation and pertinent references is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Background summary of IC/BPS patient related outcome measures.

The committee identified 4 critical areas of interest to the goals related to outcomes in IC/BPS. These included (1) PROs for both clinical trials and clinical practice; (2) Primary outcome endpoints for clinical trials; (3) Secondary (and tertiary) PROMs for research; and (4) Best IC/BPS symptom questionnaires for characterizing and following patients in general urology practice.

Corresponding clinical questions were formulated within those areas using a modified PICO format. The detailed modified PICO questions are listed in Table 2.

Modified PICO* questions addressed by the Outcomes subcommittee.

Based on the literature review, committee expertise and experience and feedback from the IC/BPS Consensus meeting, 12 recommendations (including the strength of recommendation) were decided upon (Table 3). These are not to be construed as guideline recommendations but rather practical recommendations to consider when designing clinical studies and/or trials or following patients in general urology practice.

Table 3
Consensus recommendations for Outcome Measures for IC/BPS studies, trials and general clinical practice. A STRONG recommendation implies that the outcomes committee believed that the vast majority of experts would make this recommendation based on available evidence and clinical experience. A CONDITIONAL recommendation was made when the outcome committee believed most experts would opt for the recommendation based on the evidence, however, a substantial minority of experts would choose an alternative plan.

Safety Program Content

The Safety Program had 3 primary goals: (1) assist practices with establishing AS infrastructure, (2) assist practice members with understanding best practices in antibiotic prescribing for common infectious conditions seen in ambulatory care, and (3) improve antibiotic prescribing teamwork, communication, and safety culture among the practice members and with patients and family members. During the 12-month Safety Program, there were 14 webinars (each repeated twice and recorded for participants, and led by S.C.K. T.M.C, and J. A.L.). Webinars were focused on the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases and used the Four Moments of Antibiotic Decision Making framework (Box). This framework encourages clinicians to answer 4 questions to determine (1) whether antibiotics are necessary, (2) what diagnostic testing is needed, (3) the safest and most effective antibiotic, and (4) ensure patients have an appropriate follow-up plan. Additional educational content included audio presentations, 1-page summary documents, patient handouts, and discussion guides (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Practices were encouraged to post commitment posters including practice member signatures or pictures to highlight the practice's commitment to safe antibiotic prescribing. Participants had access to the Safety Program team via question-and-answer sessions after webinars, twice-monthly office hour sessions, and an email account. In addition, an external quality improvement expert was assigned to each practice to assist with implementing the Safety Program content through monthly calls.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — recognition and research needs include that IC has only been recognized as a highly prevalent health problem in the last 20 years, and there is an urgent need for a long-term registry following patients over several decades prospectively to inform the natural course and effective interventions for future trials. Although progress in developing specific IC/BPS treatments has been slow, modulation of visceral nociceptive pathways can occur at peripheral, spinal and supraspinal sites with a wide variety of potential drug targets; compounds that hit several targets might be the best option in the short term, yet there is emerging evidence that a more refined approach may be achievable.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^116ALrk3]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary

A pertinent and a succinct ward-round note is a critical link to safe care delivery. Our ward-round notes were mostly unstructured and unmethodical, compromising interprofessional communication, patient and medico-legal safety.

We selected the SOAP format noting its attribute to capture specific information while offering flexibility to the doctor relying on a simple format. Team exchanges were instrumental in learning methods to apply the concept. Use of visual reminders in the form of acronyms emerged successful in embedding the change. Special cause variation from unexpected pandemic environments had a dense impact, warranting shift in the change idea, right in the middle of the journey. Regular physician engagements and reciprocity towards their sentiments aided continued team participation especially during unforeseen disruptions.

Interpretations

Out of the four interventions tested, visual reinforcements, i.e. SOAP acronym on the case sheet and visual reminder during huddles, had stronger and sustained impact. Visual reminders proved effective even during higher caseloads. This corroborates with previously tested interventions such as prefilled templates, which demonstrate sustained impact.

Themes from team feedback revealed that structured notes translated into meaningful clinical practice. Improved reflection of plan in the notes facilitated efficient discharge preparations besides enhanced communication opportunities with the family. Systematic representation of patient assessment also facilitated early detection in clinical deterioration and timely escalation of treatment. Meaningful practice perceived with structured notes proved to be a valuable factor in maintaining gains for 5 months in the pre-COVID phase. Subsequently, a minor modification of using reminders in department information board resulted in a prompt revival after the initial COVID-19 phase. This confirmed our belief that the clinicians valued the change.

However, despite the internal motivation, 100% application was difficult to achieve, likely due to prevailing time constraints of care aspects in a country with high caseloads.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113HmjFr]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112tRjeX]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^113i5848]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113xzz7J]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this difference-in-differences study, we implemented a multifaceted stewardship intervention that targeted inappropriate antibiotic choice and duration of treatment. An increased proportion of guideline-adherent prescriptions was observed in the intervention period of both intervention and control sites. However, in the difference-in-differences analysis, the intervention site had a significantly larger increase in adherence than the control site.

The audit and feedback stewardship intervention was successful for UTI treatment in emergency departmentsand acuteand long-term care. In this study, we applied the audit and feedback intervention to primary care settings, where antibiotic stewardship is urgently needed. Our intervention was based on a treatment algorithm derived from the IDSA guidelines and AAFP recommendations on management of uncomplicated UTI. Our qualitative study showed that differentiating uncomplicated cystitis from other UTI syndromes is a challenge for providers; therefore, providing a set of diagnostic criteria for uncomplicated cystitis was important. This treatment algorithm describes steps that providers should take when encountered with a patient with UTI-relevant symptoms. We used this algorithm as a starting point to provide personalised, interactive, one-on-one feedback with providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated UTI and treat UTI appropriately. The content was individualised for each recipient, and specific information about the correct solution was included to maximise feedback effectiveness. Besides improvements in the clinical outcomes, we also observed that the intervention was received positively by feedback recipients.

### The MAPP research network: design, patient characterization and operations [^115LzYzo]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are defined by the hallmark symptom of chronic pain in the region of the pelvis, urogenital floor, or external genitalia, often accompanied by urinary symptoms, such as urinary urgency or frequency. The bladder has historically been thought to be the origin of IC/BPS symptoms; whereas the prostate gland has traditionally been believed to be the source of CP/CPPS symptoms. However, this viewpoint has come under recent challenge, in large part from the observation that many IC/BPS and CP/CPPS patients exhibiting symptoms do not have identifiable pathology in these organs.

The impact and burden of IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are substantial. Patients suffer considerable morbidity resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life for both the patient and his/her partner due to the physical and psychological impact of the condition. In fact, the quality of life of IC patients has been characterized as being worse than that of patients undergoing dialysis. In the U.S. the prevalence of IC/BPS symptoms has been estimated to be 2.7% in women; whereas the prevalence for analogous symptoms is estimated to be 1.3% in men. Prevalence estimates for CP/CPPS in men vary between 1.8–6.4%, depending upon case definitions and screening methods.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of IC required cystoscopy and pathological findings, although more typically IC/BPS is defined from patient reported symptoms, due to the lack of consistent pathological findings, defined disease phenotypes or biological markers. Similarly, patient symptoms are used to define CP/CPPS. Each of these separate syndromes, however, may in fact represent a group of related conditions that manifest in a similar manner, but have differing etiologies. Based primarily on their somewhat similar symptom profiles, IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are here collectively termed urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) (see Table 1 for research definitions used in the MAPP Research Network). As noted in the only published phenotyping system, referred to as UPOINT, UCPPS patients have significant symptoms across the urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and tenderness domains, confirming the heterogenous nature of these syndromes.

### Developing a user-friendly report for electronically assisted surveillance of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^112HXv1v]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) surveillance is labor intensive, generally involving manual medical record review. We developed a prototype automated report through iterative design. Surveys and qualitative interviews were administered to key stakeholders to assess the report design. We found that different provider types expressed different needs regarding report content and format. Therefore, determining the primary audience for reporting data on CAUTI a priori is critical to developing useful reports, particularly as this process becomes standardized and automated.

Urine specimen collection and bag limitations — Many clinicians think that a urine collection bag affixed to the perineum has a low contamination rate if the patient's perineum is properly cleansed and rinsed before application, the bag is removed promptly after voiding, and the specimen is refrigerated or processed immediately; however, a "positive" culture result from a specimen collected in a bag cannot be used to document a UTI and confirmation requires culture of a specimen collected through catheterization or SPA, so many clinicians prefer to obtain a definitive urine specimen through catheterization initially.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1163uGLK]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — clinical trial design and outcomes are described as increasingly complex, with early clinical trials based on NIDDK research criteria resulting in two-thirds of potential subjects being excluded at the outset; further, IC/BPS patients with comorbidities have typically been excluded and this raises concerns about clinical relevance for a truly heterogeneous population. Two strategies may be useful to move the field forward: entry criteria for these trials could be as broad as possible to permit subgroup analysis, and clinically-important subgroups could be identified a priori and evaluated for treatment responses. A key issue will be to identify clinically relevant objective criteria for patient enrollment, and a validated urine marker would provide an objective criterion and allow subclassification. The selection of outcome measures remains challenging given flares, remission, and symptom progression, making it difficult to establish a baseline over a longer observation period; although evaluating responses to an evoked painful visceral stimulus has been suggested, it is not clear if this predicts responses to spontaneous visceral pain, and reliable new outcome measures will have to be developed; a biomarker would be an ideal outcome measure if it would measure the presence of IC/BPS and reflect response to treatment.

RICE epidemiologic case definitions and prevalence — validated definitions and application to men and women are reported as follows: "One with high sensitivity that correctly identified IC/BPS cases 81% of the time (with 54% specificity) and one with high specificity that correctly excluded non-IC/BPS cases 83% of the time (with 81% sensitivity)", with case definitions "captured in an 11-item questionnaire" that "are not appropriate for use as diagnostic criteria". Among adult US females, prevalence estimates ranged "from 2.7% to 6.53% (approximately 3.3 to 7.9 million US women age 18 or older)", and "Only 9.7% of women who met the definitions reported having been given an IC/BPS diagnosis". Using a modified case definition in men, prevalence estimates were "from 2.9% to 4.2% for IC/BPS" with CP/CPPS at "1.8%", overlap "approximately 17%", and authors noted that prevalence in men "approaches its prevalence in women" and "may be greatly under-diagnosed".

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^116NKA8y]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Audits on record keeping practices at our multidisciplinary hospital revealed unstructured ward-round notes which were dissimilar from each other on aspects of patient information. Written as per the discretion of the rounding physician, the practice compromised team communication and medicolegal safety and risked patient harm. Paediatricians decided to address this concern for their department and proposed to improve the quality of documentation by structuring their notes using subjective, objective, assessment and planning (SOAP) format. On observing only 13% compliance with SOAP use despite education and training to use it, a series of interventions were explored to increase its application.

Methods

Brainstorming sessions with the paediatricians provided practical solutions. These were tested one by one using plan–do–study–act cycles to understand their impact. Team feedback was pursued towards the end of each cycle to understand the opinion of each team member.

Interventions

Interventions included verbal reminders, individual feedback and SOAP acronym display. Each of these were tested singularly and serially. Acronym display proved successful until the arrival of COVID-19, which disrupted its implementation and redirected paediatricians' work priorities. This led to exploration of a new solution, and paediatricians recommended use of visual reminders at the handover site. Quantitative information was analysed to reject or retain the ideas.

Results

Verbal reminders and individual feedback made no difference to SOAP usage. Acronym display improved compliance from 13% to 90% but it fell to 45% during COVID-19. Its replacement with visual reminders during pandemic times reinstated the compliance to a median of 84%.

Conclusions

Selection of a change idea that respected front liner's constraints and suited local work environment proved valuable. Both acronym display and visual reminders served as visual reinforcements towards embracing a note format and proved effective. Perceived benefits from methodically written notes encouraged paediatricians to re-establish simpler measures to retain SOAP application, otherwise disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Patient related outcomes for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome recommendations for clinical trials and general urology practice [^116zHTcZ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

It is risky and likely an impossible proposition to recommend a single outcome instrument that can be employed successfully to describe and follow patients suffering from IC/BPS. The outcomes committee recommendations regarding outcome measures that should be considered in IC/BPS are outlined in Table 3. They were based on what the committee members believed were the most critical areas to be examined and then formulated by addressing PICO type questions.

4.1 Patient Related Outcomes (PROs)

It is recognized that PROs are the "holy grail" of outcome evaluation in clinical trials and clinical practice. While the committee were impressed with several of the IC/BPS PROMs presently available, we could not identify any correctly designed and validated PROs specific to IC/BPS. The Bladder Pain Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (BPIC‐SS) was developed using a methodology incorporating both qualitative and quantitative approach, while the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) modified from the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI) and has been shown to be responsive to change in an unreplicated post hoc analysis of a small treatment study. It should be our top priority to develop evidence‐based PROs in IC/BPS (or modify and/or validate existing PROMs). The PRO would follow a patient centered approach to comprehensively assess the impact of treatment. Once such a PRO has been validated and found to be reliable for clinical follow‐up it could be used for either a primary (or to complement a primary) or secondary outcome in a clinical trial. Such a PRO would prove invaluable for follow‐up in clinical practice. The development and validation of IC/BPS PROs is beyond the scope of our objective. We recommend that a mixed method study design based on both quantitative like interview, focused group discussion and qualitative approaches should be our next essential step in this field.

Intervention 4: visual prompter on team compliance with SOAP usage

PDSA 4

We discontinued writing the SOAP acronym in files and ran a fresh PDSA in August 2020 to test a new intervention. We displayed our initiative's performance (as a measure of percentage notes written under SOAP format) on the department information board placed at the huddle station using a chart display (online supplemental annexure 4). A coloured printout of our chart displaying the latest data was pinned on the information board every Wednesday. We also maintained a log of these updates. Paediatricians reported that well-articulated notes relayed information efficiently among doctors and nurses. In COVID-19 times when patient interaction time was stressed and group exchanges were suspended, comprehensive notes relayed enhanced communication and improved work efficiency. On noting an improvement of 72% towards use of the SOAP template, we retained this change idea.

Study of the interventions

Every intervention was tested individually, and outcomes were analysed over the corresponding time frame using quantitative data to help ascertain their impact. We noted dismal compliance with SOAP notes with the first two interventions, while the last two demonstrated a significant rise in SOAP application.

We observed no improvement on testing our first intervention (verbal team reminders) even though it was easy and simple to execute. While the team agreed to use the SOAP format after this intervention, they were often using it partially. Paediatricians then recommended that we provide specific component-based reminders, which led to our second intervention. This intervention led to a marginal improvement with some paediatricians finding this a criticism of their documentation efforts. We therefore discarded the first two interventions. Our third intervention (visual reminder in case sheets) led to a steeper rise in compliance from 19% to 52% in the month of October 2019. This improved further to 60% in November 2019. This change was appreciated by the team as it was a strong cue to use the format especially during busy shifts. Our maximum compliance reached 92% against a low case load and stayed close to 90% even during heavy caseloads.

Both our outcome and process measures plunged with the arrival of COVID-19. Further, ability to enter the acronym also suffered and implementation processes declined from 67% to 33%, resulting from reduced manpower and COVID-19 driven anxieties. This warranted a switch to our fourth intervention in August 2020, which demonstrated a rise in SOAP use from 72% to 91% in December 2020.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112YSyTY]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — analgesic selection and titration: It is important that the patient understand that finding the medication or combination of medications that provide effective pain control requires a "trial and error" method of prescribing. The efficacy of each analgesic administered should be determined and only one drug should be titrated at a time; otherwise it is not possible to assess the effects of a certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals, guided by pain scores and side effects, and this requires frequent contact between the patient and the clinician. It is important for the patient and the prescribing clinician to understand that some side effects actually improve as the patient continues to take the drug for several weeks, and if these side effects are not intolerable, then the patient should be guided through this period. Patients and clinicians should be aware that 100% pain relief is often not achievable; the focus of pain management is to minimize discomfort and maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Patient related outcomes for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome recommendations for clinical trials and general urology practice [^114eYQL9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Summary

The outcomes committee of the IC/BPS Consensus Meeting believes that more effort must be made to develop and validate a better IC/BPS specific PRO, based on unbiased patient qualitative research methodology, to better delineate outcomes in this enigmatic and variable pain/urinary syndrome. At the present time, the only recommend primary outcome is the NRS/VAS pain scale and voiding diaries as reasonable primary endpoint outcome measures. These are crude outcome measures that do not consider the complexities of the condition, of patients' variable clinical phenotypes and/or patients' desires and expectations. The committee believes that the best available IC/BPS specific secondary PROMs include the patients' subjective assessment of outcomes (GRA) and composite scores of pain, urinary symptoms and impact/quality of life. Arguably the most accepted contemporary composite IC/BPS specific PROM is the NIH GUPI (the OS ICSI/PI can be used for trial comparisons), although further validation and reliability testing of other instruments may result in better and simpler assessment outcome tools. Researchers and physicians managing IC/BPS patients need to be aware and if appropriate, use generic PROMs that measure and describe pain, quality of life, sexual, and psychosocial parameters of this complex biopsychosocial condition. Until a validated PRO that reliably measures change over time is developed, the committee believes that the NIH GUPI or the PUF questionnaire provides reasonable clinical evaluation of patients in standard general practice. Above all, the committee strongly believes that more research is required to create better IC/BPS PRO‐based outcome measures.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^117LnxXk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^116hfExp]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Interventions

In May 2019, we met all paediatricians and highlighted the concerns arising from unstructured ward-round notes, particularly the aspect of selective and variable patient information by different doctors compromising team communication and medicolegal integrity. We introduced the concept of structuring these notes using the SOAP format and shared information material on its methodology. The concept was appreciated by all, and many expressed familiarity with it from their training years. Following their agreement to use the format, training sessions were conducted to educate all consultants to implement it during rounds. All consultants were covered using serial training sessions by the end of the month. In the months of May 2019–July 2019, we evaluated our paediatric case files to learn our compliances with SOAP format (this constituted as our baseline). For this, we identified a senior consultant who audited all paediatric case records daily and ascertained whether information relayed in the ward-round notes matched the SOAP format and was relevant to each component of the acronym. However, we observed only a marginal compliance of 13% with SOAP use for these months.

Following this, we organised a brainstorming session where we sought their ideas on how to imbibe the practice in routine functioning. Our front liners put forth several reminder-based solutions which were tested using month-long plan–do–study–act (PDSA) cycles.

Intervention 1: verbal reminders to use SOAP format (August 2019)

PDSA 1

This change idea was tested with a PDSA cycle conducted throughout the month of August 2019. We selected 2 days of the week and on those days participated in departmental huddles to remind paediatricians to use SOAP format during their ward rounds. We maintained a calendar of these reminder meets, and our senior consultant audited all case files daily to identify the presence of SOAP format and also corroborate content under each of its components. We continued to observe only 13% use of SOAP format, reflecting no change from our baseline status. It was seen that while paediatricians increasingly wrote as per SOAP template, out of the four headings, they often missed one or the other. Paediatricians insisted that they require specific heading-based reminders.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: why a global patient registry is critically needed [^115JZQfg]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to establish expert consensus on the rationale for, and components of, a global patient registry for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our goal is to highlight what a comprehensive international patient registry can add to the growing body of IC/BPS-focused research and summarize the committee's rationale for inclusion or exclusion of certain patient and diagnostic characteristics to identify sub-groups of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy.

Materials and Methods

An expert working group was formed from members of the Global Consensus on IC/BPS meeting. The working group consisted of four Urologists and a Urogynaecologist, and held a series of meetings in 2025 to achieve consensus on the benefits, hurdles and practical aspects of developing a global registry for IC/BPS. Literature search of the PubMed database was also performed where relevant, and all members agreed on the final proposals.

Results

The framework for an IC/BPS global registry was developed inclusive of male and female patients ages 18 years and older, who have symptoms of pain, pressure or discomfort related to the bladder, along with lower urinary tract symptoms, that have persisted for 3 or more months, in the absence of confusable disorders. A comprehensive list of patient data points including demographic, history-related, and comorbid conditions was developed. Additionally, validated questionnaires were identified for inclusion that assess domains of pain, urinary symptoms and quality of life. Consensus was reached regarding collecting data on prior treatment, cystoscopy findings and biopsy results where applicable. Lastly, importance was placed on patient-reported questionnaire data that can be input longitudinally by patients to lessen the burden of data collection by providers. Technical, legal and financial aspects were addressed as potential barriers.

Conclusions

A global registry for IC/BPS would overcome the limitations of current regional registries by including large numbers of patients from varied geographical locations, allowing for more efficient recruitment of patients for clinical trials. Understanding epidemiological trends and global variation in practice would enable optimization of care and quality improvement worldwide.

Urinary tract infections in ADPKD — AUA/CUA/SUFU-aligned statements: The Work Group agrees that statements from the American Urological Association (AUA)/Canadian Urological Association (CUA)/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) for the general population apply to people with ADPKD, and notes this is not a formal endorsement and to refer to local guidelines where available. Recommendation 2.6.1 states clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Recommendation 2.6.2 states clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Recommendation 2.6.3 states clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Recommendation 2.6.4 states that, following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B). The text also notes that asymptomatic pyuria is relatively common in people with ADPKD and does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and that asymptomatic pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics (except during pregnancy), which is the same recommendation as that for the general population.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^116FqNn6]. IDSA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to patients with antimicrobial-resistant UTI, IDSA 2022 guidelines recommend to administer standard infusion meropenem as the preferred treatment option in patients with cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales resistant to ertapenem (ertapenem MICs ≥ 2 mcg/mL) but susceptible to meropenem (meropenem MICs ≤ 1 mcg/mL), when carbapenemase testing results are either not available or negative.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to patients with Candida UTI, IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to initiate amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days or oral flucytosine 25 mg/kg QID for 7–10 days in patients with symptomatic Candida cystitis caused by fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^112cy9EG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.
