## Question

Approach to chest pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step approach to evaluating chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and life-threatening causes. Then, I should verify the core elements of the focused history and exam. Next, I will review ECG timing and serial strategies, followed by biomarker interpretation and risk stratification. After that, I need to check disposition pathways for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, including test selection and shared decision-making. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid identification of life-threatening etiologies such as ACS, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture, because delays here carry the highest morbidity and mortality, and I should not let diagnostic steps slow definitive therapy like reperfusion for STEMI or anticoagulation for PE when indicated [^113xH9FF] [^111tttmr].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG timing before anything else. The ECG must be obtained and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival for any patient with acute chest pain, and if STEMI is present, activate reperfusion immediately without waiting for biomarkers, while remembering that serial ECGs are warranted when the initial tracing is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high [^114tR4dt] [^112JTzTy].

> I need to ensure the focused history captures the essentials: onset, location, radiation, character, duration, precipitating and relieving factors, associated symptoms, and prior similar episodes, and I should explicitly ask about cardiovascular risk factors and prior testing. Importantly, I should avoid labeling symptoms as "atypical" and instead classify them as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac to prevent underestimation of risk, especially in women who may present with more accompanying symptoms yet still have ACS at similar rates to men [^114L3p7U] [^117RnQuU] [^112fojFo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the exam. While there are no findings specific for ischemia, I should look for high-risk features such as hypotension, tachycardia, new murmurs suggesting acute mitral regurgitation or VSD, jugular venous distension, rales, or other signs of heart failure, and I should also palpate for reproducible chest wall tenderness and inspect for unilateral breath sounds or surgical emphysema that might suggest noncardiac causes [^113iX3S4] [^113JDTgA].

> Next, I should review biomarker strategy. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is preferred and should be drawn at presentation, with serial sampling at 1–3 hours for hs-cTn or 3–6 hours for conventional assays per institutional protocols, and if symptoms began at least 3 hours before arrival and the ECG is normal, a single hs-cTn below the limit of detection can exclude myocardial injury in selected patients, though I must integrate the entire clinical picture before ruling out ACS [^115Tpq6A] [^114r7B1D] [^111vcu4i].

> I will now examine risk stratification. Using a validated clinical decision pathway such as HEART or an institutional accelerated pathway, I should categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk strata to guide disposition and testing, recognizing that low-risk is generally defined as less than 1% 30-day risk of death or MACE and that structured risk assessment improves consistency and safety across settings [^1144ozkh] [^11742mtg] [^116GLb8x].

> For low-risk patients, let me think about disposition carefully. If the 30-day risk is under 1% and the ECG and troponins are nondiagnostic, it is reasonable to discharge without urgent cardiac testing, but I should provide clear return precautions, arrange timely primary care follow-up, and consider patient decision aids to communicate risk and reduce low-value testing, while documenting the rationale for discharge [^116RFQAY] [^1119ytAY] [^117FpDzx].

> For intermediate-risk patients, I should confirm that observation in a chest pain unit is reasonable to shorten length of stay and reduce costs compared with inpatient admission, and for subsequent testing I need to choose between anatomic and functional strategies based on pretest probability, patient factors, and local expertise. Coronary CT angiography is often preferred in younger patients without known CAD and can expedite diagnosis, while stress testing remains appropriate when CCTA is contraindicated or less informative, and I should remember that CCTA-based strategies can reduce unnecessary admissions in intermediate-risk ED patients [^114yLT3N] [^113fJeLa] [^117VsZSy] [^11476RoR].

> For high-risk patients, I should double-check that the pathway leads to urgent invasive coronary angiography when ischemia is suspected, with guideline-directed medical therapy initiated promptly, and I must not delay reperfusion for STEMI while pursuing additional noninvasive testing, as this directly impacts survival and outcomes [^114uP7HV] [^113JDTgA].

> But wait, what if the ECG shows posterior involvement? I should consider posterior leads V7–V9 when there is high suspicion for posterior MI with a nondiagnostic initial ECG, because missing posterior infarction can delay reperfusion and worsen outcomes, and I need to ensure serial ECGs are repeated if symptoms persist or the condition deteriorates [^115u9pdV] [^112JTzTy].

> Let me reconsider noncardiac causes if the cardiac workup is negative or risk is low. Gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and psychological etiologies should be considered, and for recurrent noncardiac chest pain after a negative ischemic evaluation, referral to cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce symptom burden, while chest radiography is reasonable in the initial assessment to identify alternative diagnoses without delaying emergent interventions [^1124AX9d] [^116sYTH1] [^111NZyQa].

> I should confirm special population considerations. In women, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion given frequent under-recognition and misclassification, in older adults I should weigh frailty and the likelihood of ischemia when choosing stress testing versus CCTA, in patients with prior CABG or known CAD I should optimize GDMT before additional testing, and in those with suspected INOCA I should plan outpatient functional testing and symptom-guided therapy rather than routine invasive angiography [^112fojFo] [^117VsZSy] [^113kefyX] [^116SCubf].

> Next, I should review shared decision-making. For low-risk patients, decision aids improve understanding and reduce unnecessary testing, and for intermediate-risk patients, discussing options, radiation exposure, costs, and timing of tests supports alignment with patient preferences and may reduce low-value care, which I should document explicitly in the record [^1119ytAY] [^116HmBxw] [^112qCYuZ].

> Hold on, I should verify system-level actions. Patients with acute chest pain should activate EMS rather than drive themselves, because prehospital care reduces ischemic time and cardiac arrests en route occur in about 1 in 300 private transports, and in the office setting, if ACS is suspected, urgent ED transfer by EMS should not be delayed for additional testing [^112Zt9x3] [^113MRzAf] [^111Y78wp].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation is complete and actionable. I should record symptom characterization, risk factors, ECG timing and findings, troponin results with intervals, the risk stratification tool used, the disposition rationale including shared decision-making, and follow-up plans, because clear documentation supports quality care, communication, and medicolegal defensibility [^notfound].

---

The evaluation of chest pain centers on **immediate ECG within 10 minutes** [^114tR4dt] and **early high-sensitivity troponin** [^111vcu4i] to rapidly identify life-threatening causes (ACS, PE, aortic dissection) [^117Nz4dk] and guide disposition. Use **clinical decision pathways** (HEART, EDACS, TIMI) [^1144ozkh] to stratify risk and determine the need for further testing or admission [^116GLb8x]. For low-risk patients, discharge without urgent testing is appropriate [^116RFQAY]; for intermediate risk, use CCTA or stress testing [^1158u1Hw]; for high risk, proceed to invasive angiography [^114uP7HV]. Always consider noncardiac causes [^1124AX9d], apply sex-specific risk assessment [^112fojFo], and use shared decision-making to align care with patient preferences [^116HmBxw].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

### Immediate evaluation

- **Vital signs**: Assess hemodynamic stability [^113xH9FF].
- **ECG**: Obtain within 10 minutes of arrival [^114tR4dt]; interpret for STEMI, ischemia, arrhythmias [^112JTzTy].
- **Troponin**: Use high-sensitivity assays at presentation [^1136KvSZ]; repeat at 1–3 hours if hs-cTn, 3–6 hours if conventional [^114wzEjJ].

---

### Risk stratification

Use **clinical decision pathways** (HEART, EDACS, TIMI) [^1144ozkh] to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk for 30-day MACE [^11742mtg]. Define **low risk** as < 1% 30-day risk of death or MACE [^11742mtg], allowing discharge without urgent testing [^116RFQAY].

---

## Diagnostic testing and imaging

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Perform a **12-lead ECG** within 10 minutes [^114tR4dt]; if nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, obtain serial ECGs [^112JTzTy]. For suspected posterior MI, add **posterior leads (V7–V9)** [^115u9pdV].

---

### Cardiac biomarkers

Prefer **high-sensitivity troponin** for early detection/exclusion of myocardial injury [^1136KvSZ]. If serial testing is indicated, repeat at **1–3 hours (hs-cTn) or 3–6 hours (conventional)** [^115Tpq6A] [^114wzEjJ].

---

### Imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) | Intermediate-risk patients; low-risk with ongoing symptoms | - Rapid <br/> - Noninvasive <br/> - High sensitivity for CAD [^notfound] | Radiation, contrast, not for high-risk [^111sLkhK] |
| Stress testing (ETT, stress echo, nuclear) | Intermediate-risk patients; exercise capacity assessment | - Functional assessment <br/> - Prognostic value [^notfound] | False positives, limited by baseline ECG, obesity |
| Invasive coronary angiography | High-risk patients; STEMI/NSTEMI | - Gold standard <br/> - Therapeutic | Invasive, complications [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical decision pathways and algorithms

- **Low-risk patients**: Discharge without urgent testing; provide education and follow-up [^116RFQAY].
- **Intermediate-risk patients**: Use CCTA or stress testing; observation units can reduce length of stay and cost [^114yLT3N].
- **High-risk patients**: Invasive angiography and guideline-directed therapy [^114uP7HV].

---

## Special considerations

### Sex-specific differences

Women more often have **accompanying symptoms** (nausea, dyspnea) [^1136KvSZ] and are at risk of **underdiagnosis**. Risk tools may **underestimate risk in women**, so maintain a high index of suspicion [^112fojFo].

---

### Noncardiac causes

Evaluate for **gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and psychological causes** [^115JPCFA] [^116sYTH1] [^1144wiiW] when cardiac testing is negative [^111CZjxQ]. For persistent noncardiac chest pain, consider **cognitive behavioral therapy** [^111NZyQa].

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Use **shared decision-making** [^112qCYuZ] to discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives, improving understanding and reducing low-value testing [^116HmBxw]. Provide **education** on symptom recognition, when to seek care, and medication adherence [^111da6uC].

---

## Follow-up and disposition

Arrange **close follow-up** for low-risk patients, with clear return precautions [^notfound]. Consider **observation units** for intermediate-risk patients to enable efficient testing and safe disposition [^114yLT3N].

---

## Quality improvement and system-level considerations

Implement **standardized protocols** to improve consistency, timeliness, and outcomes [^114wzEjJ]. Engage in **continuous monitoring** of metrics (door-to-ECG time, troponin turnaround, disposition accuracy) to identify and address gaps [^111Y78wp].

---

The modern approach to chest pain is **rapid ECG and hs-troponin–based risk stratification** [^114YvKwr], followed by CDP-guided testing and disposition, with shared decision-making and attention to sex-specific and noncardiac factors [^111da6uC].

Electrocardiogram — actionable recommendations in chest pain: For patients with chest pain and a nondiagnostic initial electrocardiogram (ECG), "serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates". If the initial ECG is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients "should be treated according to STEMI and NSTE-ACS guidelines". For intermediate‑to‑high clinical suspicion with a nondiagnostic initial ECG, "supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior MI".

### Psychological interventions for noncardiac chest pain… [^111NZyQa]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best way to treat noncardiac chest pain. Evidence-Based Answer Noncardiac chest pain can be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, panic disorder, or a number of other psychological conditions. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavior therapy, has been shown to reduce the number of days with chest pain significantly over a three-month period, whatever the cause.
1. 5 Noncardiac chest pain can be difficult to treat. Empiric treatment with high-dose omeprazole can benefit patients in whom GERD is suspected. 6 Trazodone and imipramine also have been investigated as possible treatments for non-cardiac chest pain, although the studies were small.
4. The authors of this Cochrane review 1 analyzed psychotherapy as treatment for noncardiac chest pain and found a modest benefit. Patients received from one to 12 sessions of therapy.

Although the interventions varied, almost all included breathing exercises, and most also included cognitive restructuring and relaxation exercises. In some studies, the intervention also included problem solving, physical exercise, and graded exposure. Cognitive behavior therapy can be carried out in individual or group settings and can be administered by a physician, nurse, psychologist, or other trained professional. Coshrane Abstract Background. Recurrent chest pain in the absence of coronary artery disease is a common problem that sometimes leads to excessive use of medical care. Although many studies examine the causes of pain in these patients, few clinical trials have evaluated treatment. The studies reviewed in this paper 1 provide an insight into the effectiveness of psychologic interventions for these patients. Primary Results. Eight studies involving 403 randomized participants in total were included.

There was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months following the intervention. Reviewers' Conclusions. Review suggested a modest to moderate benefit for psychologic interventions, particularly those using a cognitive behavior framework, which was largely restricted to the first three months after the intervention. The evidence for brief interventions was less clear. Further RCTs of psychologic interventions for nonspecific chest pain with follow-up periods of at least 12 months are needed.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^115cynDQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to use the following time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements for the evaluation of patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, if serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury:

- 1–3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin

- 3–6 hours for conventional troponin assays.

Defining chest pain — recommendations (class of recommendation [COR] and level of evidence [LOE]) — include that an initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states that chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature; instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to take into account previous testing when available and incorporate into clinical decision pathways in patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — troponin sampling, prior testing, and single-sample rule-out: In patients for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, repeat measurements after the initial sample are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays. Institutions should implement a clinical decision pathway (CDP) with a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, and previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs. For patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of anatomic vs functional index testing in patients with low-risk stable chest pain [^111f71br]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are first-line anatomic approaches to low-risk stable chest pain evaluation cost-effective compared with functional testing?

Findings

In this cost-effectiveness analysis using an individual-based Markov microsimulation model based on 10 003 participants in a randomized clinical trial, anatomic approaches were cost-effective compared with functional testing across a wide range of variations in clinical care and patient characteristics. Adding fractional flow reserve to coronary computed tomography angiography resulted in modest improvements after the initially increased costs of care were offset by fewer and more targeted coronary revascularizations.

Meaning

These findings suggest that anatomic strategies may present a favorable initial diagnostic option in the evaluation of low-risk stable chest pain compared with functional testing.

Emergency department ECG assessment summary — The ECG is a critical component of the initial assessment and management of ED patients with possible ACS. The ECG should be rapidly assessed for evidence of acute infarction or ischemia, and if present, subsequent care should follow current guidelines for management of acute STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The ECG should also be examined for subtle changes that are also consistent with ACS as well as for other findings that could suggest a non-ACS cause for their symptoms, and patients who have a non-ischemic ECG (as defined previously) are eligible for entering a CDP, and further clinical evaluation should take place as outlined later.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chest pain-possible acute coronary syndrome [^116MXEMW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits and inpatient evaluation, with particular concern for acute coronary syndrome as an etiology, since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Although history-based, electrocardiographic, and laboratory evaluations have shown promise in identifying coronary artery disease, early accurate diagnosis is paramount and there is an important role for imaging examinations to determine the presence and extent of anatomic coronary abnormality and ischemic physiology, to guide management with regard to optimal medical therapy or revascularization, and ultimately to thereby improve patient outcomes. A summary of the various methods for initial imaging evaluation of suspected acute coronary syndrome is outlined in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^112jFgm9]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of acute chest pain has been augmented in recent years by advances in the sensitivity and precision of cardiac troponin assays, new biomarkers, improvements in imaging modalities, and release of new clinical decision algorithms. This progress has enabled physicians to diagnose or rule-out acute myocardial infarction earlier after the initial patient presentation, usually in emergency department settings, which may facilitate prompt initiation of evidence-based treatments, investigation of alternative diagnoses for chest pain, or discharge, and permit better utilization of healthcare resources. A non-trivial proportion of patients fall in an indeterminate category according to rule-out algorithms, and minimal evidence-based guidance exists for the optimal evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of these patients. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the ESC proposes approaches for the optimal application of early strategies in clinical practice to improve patient care following the review of recent advances in the early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The following specific 'indeterminate' patient categories were considered: (i) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin < 99th percentile; (ii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin < 99th percentile but above the limit of detection; (iii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile but without dynamic change; and (iv) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile and dynamic change but without coronary plaque rupture/erosion/dissection. Definitive evidence is currently lacking to manage these patients whose early diagnosis is 'indeterminate' and these areas of uncertainty should be assigned a high priority for research.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Patient-centric considerations — emergency medical services (EMS) activation state that in patients with acute chest pain, it is recommended that 9–1–1 be activated by patients or bystanders to initiate transport to the closest emergency department (ED) by EMS. To ensure the timely delivery of appropriate care, especially reperfusion therapy, it is strongly recommended that patients with acute chest pain be transported to the ED by trained EMS personnel; EMS transportation is associated with substantial reductions in ischemic time and treatment delays, and 1 in 300 patients with chest pain transported to the ED by private vehicle suffers a cardiac arrest en route.

### Cardiac CT in the assessment of acute chest pain in the emergency department [^112eW2cE]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current role of ECG-synchronized CT in the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain (triple rule-out) in the emergency department. We discuss clinical contexts of the chest pain algorithm, technical improvements that have enabled CT to attain its current role for this application, scan protocols and radiation considerations, the evidence base regarding diagnostic and prognostic performance, and initial data on the cost-effectiveness of this promising emerging test.

Conclusion

Currently available evidence suggests that CT-based approaches with modern scan technology are safe, accurate, and potentially cost-saving, although large-scale clinical trials are needed to ascertain the precise role of CT in the evaluation of acute chest pain.

Initial evaluation — history for chest pain emphasizes that in patients with chest pain, a focused history that includes characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment should be obtained. A comprehensive history that captures all the characteristics of chest pain, including but not limited to its 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) location and radiation; 4) precipitating factors; 5) relieving factors; and 6) associated symptoms, can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients. The initial ECG is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease.

Electrocardiogram in patients with chest pain: When the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is nondiagnostic, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms persist, or the clinical condition deteriorates (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Patients with chest pain whose initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and non–ST–segment–elevation ACS guidelines (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients with intermediate- to high clinical suspicion for ACS and a nondiagnostic initial ECG, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior myocardial infarction (MI) (COR 2a, LOE B-NR).

### How Do we balance the long-term health of a patient with the short-term risk to the physician? [^111aj3wc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a wide variation in practice patterns among emergency medicine physicians; many factors weigh into the medical decision-making process including the health of the patient as well as short-term risk to the physician.

Objective

The objective of our discussion is to illustrate specific scenarios where medical decisions are focused on the physician's short-term risk, then to propose an approach to shifting the balance to the patient's long-term health.

Methods

Using recent data on the evaluation, disposition, and outcomes of patients with low-risk chest pain in the emergency department, we calculate the risk of outpatient evaluation compared to the common practice of admission or observation.

Results

Patients with low-risk chest pain and negative initial evaluation in the emergency department with 2 normal cardiac biomarkers, normal vital signs, and non-ischemic, interpretable ECGs, have an extremely low-risk of a short term clinically relevant adverse cardiac event. There is a suggestion of a higher patient risk from admission, prompting consideration that continued evaluation of the chest pain as an outpatient may be safer than admission or observation.

Conclusion

A test/intervention should be done if the risk of a missed diagnosis or adverse outcome is greater that the risk of the test/intervention. Involving the patient in the decision-making process may help to shift the management balance from the physician's short-term concern of their own risk, to the patient's long-term health.

### The prospective randomized trial of the optimal evaluation of cardiac symptoms and revascularization: rationale and design of the PRECISE trial [^112VCnqM]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians vary widely in their preferred diagnostic approach to patients with non-acute chest pain. Such variation exposes patients to potentially avoidable risks, as well as inefficient care with increased costs and unresolved patient concerns.

Methods

The Prospective Randomized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization (PRECISE) trial (NCT03702244) compares an investigational "precision" diagnostic strategy to a usual care diagnostic strategy in participants with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Results

PRECISE randomized 2103 participants with stable chest pain and a clinical recommendation for testing for suspected CAD at 68 outpatient international sites. The investigational precision evaluation strategy started with a pre-test risk assessment using the PROMISE Minimal Risk Tool. Those at lowest risk were assigned to deferred testing (no immediate testing), and the remainder received coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) with selective fractional flow reserve (FFR CT) for any stenosis meeting a threshold of ≥ 30% and < 90%. For participants randomized to usual care, the clinical care team selected the initial noninvasive or invasive test (diagnostic angiography) according to customary practice. The use of cCTA as the initial diagnostic strategy was proscribed by protocol for the usual care strategy. The primary endpoint is time to a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction) or invasive cardiac catheterization without obstructive CAD at 1 year. Secondary endpoints include health care costs and quality of life.

Conclusions

PRECISE will determine whether a precision approach comprising a strategically deployed combination of risk-based deferred testing and cCTA with selective FFR CT improves the clinical outcomes and efficiency of the diagnostic evaluation of stable chest pain over usual care.

### Acute coronary syndromes: initial evaluation and risk stratification [^115J6EpD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain, the second most frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), often poses a challenge to the physicians dealing with these patients owing to the wide spectrum of presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A majority of the patients presenting with chest pain are usually admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Despite the availability of modern-day tools for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), about 5% of patients with AMI are missed in the ED with subsequent associated morbidity and mortality and legal consequences. Several centers have adapted critical pathways derived from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients presenting with ACS. We now have some evidence suggesting adherence to the critical pathways derived from ACC/AHA guidelines will optimize the quality of patient care and probably result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews initial evaluation and the importance of risk stratification of the patients presenting with chest pain using the currently available clinical and diagnostic tools. Critical pathways derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for various presentations of ACS are also reviewed.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^1117zN1r]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Initial evaluation… [^1144wiiW]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

2 Other potential factors include pulmonary etiologies, psychological etiologies, and nonischemic cardiovascular disorders. 2, 3, 5, 6 No definitive diagnosis may be found in as many as 15% of patients. 2 Differentiating ischemic from nonischemic causes is often challenging because patients with ischemic chest pain may appear well. As such, the initial diagnostic approach should always consider a cardiac etiology for the chest pain unless other causes are apparent.
7. Initial Evaluation The first decision point for most physicians is to determine whether the patient needs immediate referral to the emergency department for further testing to determine whether the chest pain is an acute coronary syndrome caused by coronary ischemia.

10 The impression of chest pain is often determined by a combination of clinical symptoms at the time of presentation, physical examination, initial electrocardiography, and risk factors for ACS. 11 Patients often do not use the term pain to describe their symptoms but frequently use other terms such as pressure, aching, discomfort, tightness, squeezing, or indigestion.
12. A meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the role of previous chest pain in diagnosing ACS concluded that chest pain that is pleuritic, positional, or reproducible with palpation and not related to exertion is low risk for ACS. Pain that is described as pressure, worse than prior anginal pain, associated with exertion, accompanied by nausea or diaphoresis, and/or radiates to one or both arms/shoulders is higher risk for ACS.

For patients with chest pain not requiring immediate referral who have a low to intermediate pretest probability of CAD, exercise stress testing should be considered. 26 As a result, CCTA is becoming a first-line test for patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department and should be a consideration for family physicians evaluating and managing patients with stable chest pain in the office. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in the evaluation of typical angina. For the evaluation of acute chest pain, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is comparable to angiography in mortality at one year; however, it results in less need for invasive angiography and fewer subsequent revascularization procedures. CHEST WALL PAIN Chest wall pain is the most common cause of chest pain in the outpatient setting, accounting for 33% to 50% of chest pain.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

After injuries, chest pain is "the second most common reason for adults to present to the emergency department (ED) in the United States and accounts for > 6.5 million visits, which is 4.7% of all ED visits", and "also leads to nearly 4 million outpatient visits annually in the United States". Although the cause is often noncardiac, coronary artery disease "affects > 18.2 million adults in the United States" and remains the leading cause of death, "accounting for > 365,000 deaths annually". The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is "20% to 40%, and women experience this symptom more often than men".

Chest pain — setting considerations for diagnostic testing are as follows: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided.

### Usefulness of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography as an initial diagnostic approach in patients with acute chest pain [^11476RoR]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been proposed as an accurate diagnostic tool to evaluate for coronary artery disease. However, the role of MDCT as part of the initial diagnostic for evaluating acute chest pain is less well established.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department (ED) and risk stratified them based on the pretest probability for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS): (1) very low, (2) low, (3) intermediate, (4) high, and (5) very high or definite. After exclusion of very low and very high risk patients, 268 patients were randomized to either immediate 64-slice cardiac MDCT or a conventional diagnostic strategy. Number of admissions, ED and hospital length of stay (LOS), and major adverse cardiac events over 30 days of follow-up were compared between the strategies based on the pretest probability for ACS.

Results

The number of patients ultimately diagnosed with an ACS did not differ between the 2 strategies. Emergency department LOS and total admissions were not different between strategies. Patients in the MDCT-based strategy had a decreased hospital LOS (P = .049) and fewer admissions deemed unnecessary (P = .007). Reductions in unnecessary admissions were more prominent in intermediate-risk patients (P = .015). None of the patients discharged from the ED in the MDCT-based strategy experienced major adverse cardiac events at follow-up.

Conclusion

Use of an MDCT-based strategy in the ED as part of the initial diagnostic approach for patients presenting with acute chest pain is safe and efficiently reduces avoidable admissions in patients with an intermediate pretest probability for ACS.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered.

Structure

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The "2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain" provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. These guidelines present an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

### Comparison of an initial risk-based testing strategy vs usual testing in stable symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease: the PRECISE randomized clinical trial [^112cKNxb]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

For the first time, to our knowledge, the PRECISE study demonstrates in a large randomized clinical trial that a novel initial care pathway of risk-guided patient-specific testing deferral for minimal-risk patients combined with cCTA with selective FFR-CT for the remaining patients improves clinical efficiency (catheterization without obstructive CAD) with no statistically significant adverse effect on safety (death or MI) at 1 year.

The PRECISE trial was designed to test patient selection and refinements of cCTA-based evaluation strategies in patients with stable chest pain who were previously tested in 2 large randomized clinical trials. Those trials clearly demonstrated equivalent or better outcomes for cCTA compared with usual stress testing but a propensity for initial cCTA testing to lead to over testing and unnecessary catheterization referral. The PRECISE PS was designed to improve these 2 weak points: (1) to reduce excess testing in the lowest-risk patients where diagnostic yield is extremely low and (2) to reduce excess referral to catheterization. The use of a validated risk score in the PS addressed the former problem, whereas the selective use of FFR-CT addressed the latter. Of note, the PRECISE trial cannot address alternative approaches not tested in the trial. The PS tested in this trial is concordant with current AHA/ACC Chest Pain guideline recommendationsand extends the evidence base supporting them for management of stable chest pain.

Both the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART trials confirmed excellent prognosis in the population of patients with stable chest pain while also highlighting unresolved inefficiencies in noninvasive and invasive testing. The PROMISE trial showed a low rate of the composite end point of death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina hospitalization, and major procedural complications of 1.5% per year, with no difference between arms. However, the trial has been criticized for testing very low-risk patients and a 50% higher rate of catheterization in the cCTA arm. The initial report of the SCOT-HEART trial also showed a low rate of cardiovascular death or MI (2% per year) and a borderline difference which became significant by 5 years. The SCOT-HEART trial also noted higher initial new referrals to catheterization in the cCTA arm (94 vs 8) with higher late referrals with standard care. The PRECISE trial provides a pragmatic pathway addressing both concerns, providing randomized evidence in support of a quantitative algorithm for deferred testing and for the use of cCTA with selective FFR-CT as the initial test. Our findings provide practical data addressing the recognized need to improve the evaluation of patients with chest pain.

Patients who present to the ED with chest pain (or its equivalent) but have no electrocardiographic changes or elevation in cardiac biomarkers after an appropriate interval can be considered low risk for acute coronary syndrome. Combined with a low demographic risk for coronary artery disease (eg, using Framingham criteria), such patients can be said to be "low risk" for a subsequent coronary event. Whether there is a role for further risk stratification with provocative testing and/or coronary imaging before discharge remains open to debate.

Chest pain in women — synopsis and risk patterns indicate that most patients who present to the ED with chest pain are women, particularly among those ≥ 65 years of age. The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial demonstrated that women with moderate-to-severe ischemia are more symptomatic than men, and women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care. Women may also present with accompanying symptoms more often than men, yet chest pain remains the predominant symptom among those ultimately diagnosed with ACS, occurring with a frequency equal to men. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain.

Acute chest pain — setting considerations for diagnostic testing: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Attempt to perform 12-lead ECG in patients with chest pain within 10 minutes of arrival to a clinic or emergency setting.
- Use a clinical decision pathway to identify patients with low-risk chest pain who can be discharged from the emergency department.
- If available, use CCTA preferentially over stress testing for patients with intermediate-risk chest pain to determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. For patients with high-risk chest pain, provide referral for invasive coronary angiography. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology updated guidelines for management of chest pain, which are endorsed by five other cardiology groups. The guidelines provide new recommendations on what to consider chest pain and when to avoid testing in patients at low risk, and they endorse use of published decision pathways to determine the order and extent of workup.

Exercise can be used for any patient who is not frail and can achieve at least five metabolic equivalents, which is required to do many activities of daily living. Patients who cannot meet both requirements should receive pharmacologic stress testing. Exercise ECG testing should be avoided in patients with ECG findings of 0. 5-mm ST depression, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or digitalis use. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay.

In patients with suspected ischemia despite no obstructive cardiac disease, positron emission tomography, cardiovascular MRI, or angiography may help tailor medical therapy to improve quality of life, although they have not been demonstrated to reduce future cardiac events. In patients with nonischemic causes of chest pain, gastrointestinal causes, depression, and anxiety should be considered. Up to one-fifth of people presenting with chest pain have a gastrointestinal cause. In patients with low-risk chest pain, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disease each exceed CAD by a factor of 10. Although mental health referrals are rare even when patients report anxiety, psychotherapy for these patients reduces chest pain frequency by one-third.

### Time to move on: redefining chest pain outcomes [^112SH6iY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is the second most common presenting symptom to emergency departments (EDs), accounting for > 7 million visits in the United States each year. 1 However, as few as 10% of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain will ultimately be diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 2 ACS can be a challenging diagnosis in the ED as the initial history, physical examination, and ECG alone can neither confirm nor exclude the diagnosis. 2, 3

Although there have been many clinical decision rules for chest pain evaluation, the HEART score (history, EGG, age, risk factors, troponin) has come to the forefront of emergency medicine practice, as it is the only model to be evaluated by multiple independent research groups in both validation and clinical impact studies and has outperformed alternate prediction models in comparison studies. 2, 3

It was designed to assess patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS and identify those at low risk for adverse events who may be suitable for discharge. 4 However, the HEART score can also be used to justify hospital admission for those deemed to be moderate to high risk for a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), which may lead to increased testing and/or intervention.

But is MACE an appropriate outcome? And is the timeline relevant to a decision at the beside in the ED? A MACE outcome is a composite of acute myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and all‐cause death. Composite outcome measures, such as MACE, result in higher event rates and have been used when other serious events (missed MI or death) are relatively rare. Clinical trials designed with composite end points subsequently require fewer patients, are less costly, and can be completed more quickly. Death and acute MI are important measures to assess in composite, but including revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery) as outcome measures may imply that an adverse event has occurred, although appropriate emergent care has been provided. In addition, the MACE outcome is measured at 4–6 weeks, an unusual timeline in the ED disposition decision. This begs the question: does an increased risk of MACE at 4–6 weeks justify immediate hospitalization or emergent intervention?

Selection between modalities is framed as *Test choice guided by patient's exercise capacity, resting electrocardiographic abnormalities; CCTA preferable in those < 65 years of age and not on optimal preventive therapies; stress testing favored in those ≥ 65 years of age (with a higher likelihood of ischemia). Expected prevalence is stated as Intermediate-high risk patients have modest rates of obstructive CAD (~10%–20%) and risk of clinical events (~1%–2% per year).

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

Evidence gaps and future research in chest pain — Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms for which a person seeks medical care, and it should therefore be the target of substantial research investigation. For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), further research is needed to develop approaches to shorten the interval from symptom onset to presentation, including technologies that permit acquisition and transmission of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from home and remote evaluations (eg, telehealth). An important growing population includes women and men with angina and ACS with angiographically normal or non-obstructive coronary arteries, and further investigation is needed to clarify disease mechanisms. Early evaluation is challenged by symptom classification, and methods that improve pretest probabilities of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) may be aided with machine-learning algorithms. Clinical risk stratification and decision tools will likely grow in popularity due to electronic health record integration, and it would be useful to test them in large randomized trials.

Chest pain guideline scope — evaluation focus and exclusions — The charge of the writing committee was to develop a guideline for the evaluation of acute or stable chest pain or other anginal equivalents in various clinical settings with an emphasis on the diagnosis in ischemic causes, and the document states that it will not provide recommendations on whether revascularization is appropriate or what modality is indicated, noting that such recommendations can be found in the forthcoming ACC/ AHA coronary artery revascularization guideline; the committee first reviewed previously published guidelines and related statements and explains that Table 2 lists these publications as a resource to avoid repeating existing recommendations.

Chest pain — synopsis of care setting goals and transport: The goals in patients presenting to the ED or office with acute chest pain are: 1) identifying life-threatening causes; 2) determine clinical stability; and 3) assess need for hospitalization versus safety of outpatient evaluation and management. The 12-lead ECG, which should be acquired and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival to a medical facility, is pivotal in the evaluation because of its capacity to identify and triage patients with STEMI to urgent coronary reperfusion. In both cases, transfer should be by EMS; personal automobile for this purpose is associated with increased risk and should be avoided.

Electrocardiogram in chest pain — diagnostic use and follow-up testing: In patients with chest pain in which an initial ECG is nondiagnostic, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates (COR 1; LOE C-EO). Patients with chest pain in whom the initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and non–ST-segment–elevation ACS guidelines (COR 1; LOE C-EO). In patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high clinical suspicion for ACS in whom the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior myocardial infarction (MI) (COR 2a; LOE B-NR).

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.
